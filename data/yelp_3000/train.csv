2,Solid 3 1/2 stars.  Sashimi was super fresh.  All the cooked foods were not bad either.
3,"I've been a big fan of Tomaso's since I was a teenager so was happy to try Tommy V's.  The Italian food here tastes authentic and delicious.  They have a large wine list.  I feel the only difference between Tommy V's and Tomaso's really is the decor.  Tomaso's has that old school Italian restaurant vibe.  Tommy V's has a modern contemporary interior with a few pictures of girls on the walls where all you can focus on are their boobs.  It was kinda funny that all three of us at dinner noticed it.\nI had the eggplant torta and butternut squash ravioli.  The eggplant torta tasted to me like eggplant parmesan but in a lasagna type shape.  The butternut squash ravioli was divine.  I would love if I could just have a giant bowl of that!\nWe made reservations, but being that it was a Thursday night in the summer, they weren't really necessary.  \nTheir prices pretty much start at $15 and go up.  I noticed they have a decent happy hour menu if you are a bargain eater.  \nThis would be a fantastic date spot, but sit inside.  The patio would probably be nice during the day with friends, but there's nothing romantic about sharing a bottle of wine in front of the Grapevine and a parking lot.\nGreat Italian and great atmosphere!"
2,"I made the mistake of stopping by on a weekend afternoon during the middle of a game... Not an available seat in the place. Placed my order at the bar and sat down on the window sill (yes that is correct) and chomped down on a double bacon cheeseburger. \n\nThe people and place were great but the food was average. I don't have any desires to return. Perhaps a bar chaser would enjoy the atmosphere more as they definitely cater to spirit chaser given the large bar area. If you are looking for some insight in that regard, I'm sure my fellow yelpers have posted several divining reviews on that subject."
1,"We we went here for dinner to celebrate a coworker and friends birthday after reading the yelp reviews, which all seemed positive.  Unfortunately our dinner was mediocre and service as well.  Our server did not seem to know the menu very well and the calamari was horrible. The scallops were ok, but the asparagus was soggy and did not have that great of flavor. Our friends ordered the linguine which they said was so so. Nice ambience and so do have to say the general manager was very nice as well... just not good enough food to go back. :-("
2,"Overpriced but usually can get what you need in men's cologne, interesting they must be doing great as the manager working the opening shift, would not open the door 6 minutes early as 7 people tried to enter just before 10:00 am."
1,"Let's just say, I was not a fan!  We went here with a group in the middle of the week and we received absolutely terrible service. \n\nIt took forever for us to even get greeted let alone water. Then our food came out at all different times which is always awkward because your food gets cold while you wait for everyone else to be served. \n\nNow let's get to the food. I ordered the mac & cheese and a side salad, it was blah! In fact it tasted like processed cheese not even fresh cheese. One of my coworkers ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, and he sent it back because he said it tasted like jarred Alfredo sauce. A few others ordered sandwiches that came with french fries, and they appeared to be happy. So if you stick with the typical diner style food you'll probably be somewhat satisfied.  This is probably a good spot to take children or people with a not-so sophisticated palate!"
1,"Now in general I've spends multiple weekends at Bellagio and loved it which is why I've come back time and time again.  This last trip with my girlfriends left a bad taste in my mouth.  2 things.  When I packed up and went home, I realized that I had left a dress of mine hanging in the closet. I called Bellagio's lost and found.  I told them my room number, where i had left it and what it looked like down to the size. They told me nothing was left in the room and there was nothing in lost and found that resembled the dress. Disappointed, i left it at that. What can i do, I am more than positive that was the only place it could have been because it is no longer in my possession and I remember hanging it in the close next to the tv. \n\nThen I get a call from my friend who stayed in the same room as myself, she told me the following.  On checkout, we had sometime before our flight back to los angeles.  We then check our bags into the baggage deposit for a couple of hours. In my friends duffle along with her clothes and shoes was a small purse resembling an camera case.  When she arrived back home to unpack, the small purse was gone. The purse had a bit of money in it. My friend then called the Bellagio as well. She spoke to the Valet manager. They did not find it (not a surprise) and was told that it happens alot.  It happens ALOT?! That is not an acceptable answer. It should never happen esp when we stay at a 5 star hotel. That why we pay a higher rate because we believe it would be an honest establishment with out fear of theft to our belongings.\n\nSo...pretty much I'm going to assume that my dress that i left hanging was taken(not put in lost and found) and my friend's purse that was hidden in her duffle was stolen purposely.  My friends and I are sorely disappointed and will probably stay at another casino resort for next get away.\n\n**Ive posted the same review in Tripadvisor"
2,"I don't know why I even bother trying to write a review after Nicole has already been to a place. She's got it perfectly summarized - this place is full of the kinds of totally useless stuff that you absolutely love to have for any party. Gift wrap, balloons, candy, cards and all sorts of perfectly pretty and colorful crap that you really don't need except when you're having a party.\n\nIn the back is a very large costume section with all the accessories you need if you want to buy an outfit. That said, you might be able to save a bunch of money by renting the stuff instead from a proper costume store.\n\nPrice are hit or miss. I did spot some 99 cent rolls of wrapping paper as well as some six dollar rolls right next to them. Honestly, it was tough for me to tell the difference."
4,"Deceive your diet! Indulge in any of the appetizers and entrees knowing your feeding your body with something that's not only nutritious but tastes delicious! Sure bets are the Caprese salad, Chicken Shawarma, and Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. Prices are under $15 and portions are generous."
2,"Went to stripsteaks as this was the premiere steakhouse at Mandalay bay (we were staying there) I am a huge steak lover, so I always manage to talk the hubby into one expensive steak dinner when we are in town. We started off with the lobster fritters. Yummy..and I don't enjoy any type of seafood , but these were tasty. I split them with my husband and because there were only 3.. We fought over the remaining one...\nNext the waitress brought out these too die for French fries . 3 kinds with 3 different dipping sauces .. I devoured these (it was 9pm and I was STARVING). My husband asked if we may have more and the waitress responded yes but we will have to charge you $8... Are you kidding me... $8 when I'm already spending $250 on a dinner for 2.. Whatever!! She brought out another batch and we ate them.\nI ordered the rib eye Medium Rare and the hubby had the flat iron.. Both of us thought the meat was tough and lacked flavor.. For $60 a steak shouldn't it have been cut with a butter knife and melt in your mouth?\nWe split the potato pur\u00e9e and all 3 were delicious. The server was nice and attended to us well. We left full and skipped dessert. \nOverall very nice dinner but I prefer Vic and Anthony's or vodoo lounge steak house to this one"
3,"The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dishes include ancho raspberry-encrusted pork chops and Shawnee sea bass with a cheese and rock shrimp quesadilla, topped with shoestring sweet potatoes. The banana crisp wrapped in a sweet tortilla with blackberry compote is out of this world."
0,Come here to drink. Don't come to eat. The service is a joke. Slow food movement has a new definition.  We got our food one plate at a time. Torture. Seriously got here at 1pm. At 230pm still waiting on food.  Train wreck.  Don't order grilled cheese because they don't use oils?  Dry warm bread with melted cheese makes a grilled cheese. Wth?  Same with the hash Browns.
2,Food was good but the service sucked. They stopped checking on us and we had to go to the front of the house to pay our bill. Not really happy at all with the service.
3,descent desserts great meat dishes
4,"Wow, what a great experience. This was one of the few times I've been in a Sephora as I like make up, but never try new products, etc often! After buying cheap red lipstick bc I wanted to make sure I'd like the color, I decided I want to spend money on nice lipstick. Typically I'm a lip gloss low key lip girl. I went in and Jean was so incredibly helpful and fun with the shopping process. She gave me great tips on how to apply it, helped me pick out a great color which had all the 'color experts' saying how good I looked and went over all the different lipstick options with me. These ladies know how to make you feel good and sell the exact product you're looking for. I defiantly plan on going back when in need of another beauty adventure!"
0,"Every time I purchase a groupon from Danny's Car Wash there seems to be a technical glitch.  This time I came in with one of the receipts/vouchers generated by Danny's when I turned in my groupon certificate.  They said the car wash had already been used.  Really?  How could i have used it multiple times if you generate the ticket from your register?  To top it off, I always have to go back through and have them vaccuum the car a second time and touch up spots they miss when wiping down the interior of the car. I'm not talking about hidden spots!  I'm talking about lifting the floor mats and getting ALL of the dirt under them.  Or really cleaning the interior coffee mug holders that have obvious coffee cup stains.  I am on the hunt for a new car wash in North Scottsdale."
0,"This is not the Italian Food you're looking for.... \n\nOK, this place has gone seriously downhill with the new management, and the food was bad enough to make Marco Polo weep. \n\nLet's start with the good.... The place is big, the staff was friendly, the bar area was pretty nice, and they had a lot of TV's playing the Cardinal's game. I could totally buy this place as a sports bar. \n\nNow, on to everything else.... \n\nThe parking situation is abysmal, but hey, that's Avondale for ya... I won't blame this restaurant for the shrieking baby, that blame goes squarely on the shoulder of the parents who were busy getting their drank on. \n\nWe ordered: \nApps: Onion Rings / Friend Mushrooms / Moz Sticks\nEntree: Steak & Cheese sandwich, the \""special\"" calzone, and the lasagna. \nWell, we didn't order the lasagna at first, of the 10 things listed in the pasta section it was the only thing available that wasn't spaghetti and meatballs. \n$50.00 for the check, this included drinks & a mediocre tip. \n\nThe appetizers came to the table, and as soon as I saw the fried mushrooms I had a bad feeling. \n\nEverything was perfectly shaped and colored. This is because everything certainly came out of a freezer bag 5 minutes ago. The moz sticks were flavorless, the onion rings were perfectly round onion flavored bread rings, and the fried mushrooms were an undercooked disaster of batter, covering the world's smallest mushrooms. \n\nI'm not a super Italian food enthusiast, the kind that expects it to taste like it came from a Tuscan village. I just wanted something that tasted less like fried batter, and more like FOOD. \n\nMy wife said the Steak & Cheese was OK. The meat and cheese components were tasty enough, but the previously frozen roll was undercooked and doughy. \n\nThe lasagna was rough, Stouffer's\u00ae puts out a similar product in the frozen food section of Fry's, so save yourself some money and try that if you want, because this was just not good. No seasoning, bland cheese mix, and straight from the jar sauce that was almost too sweet. \n\nThe calzone, the Palermo's Special Calzone, was sadly also from frozen, and I can't let it go! (see what I did there?) It was perfectly shaped, and the outside was crispy, however, like all frozen entrees of this caliber, it was a soggy nightmare on the bottom. Inside it was watery and nasty. No taste, horrible \""cheese\"" filling, and the same disgusting sauce that the lasagna was made with. No Bueno. \n\nThe waitstaff was nice, if not a little absent after food delivery, but the food was abysmal. I'm a fat guy who loves to eat, and this had me rethinking everything.\n\nI can tell you that #1 Brothers is right down the road, if you want a better Italian ANYTHING, go there, cause damn."
3,"I had been patiently waiting for this place to open! I was super excited when they did, however a little underwhelmed by some of the reviews. Maybe I had hyped it up in my head too much? But I decided to give it a go anyway. \n\nWent here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately sat. We were kind of lucky coming a bit later as it wasn't too busy. The decor is adorable, with bright, spring colors. Unfortunately it was too cold to dine outside, so we were sat indoors. The booths are bright green and quite roomy-I wondered what this place was beforehand? My boyfriend seems to think it used to be a sushi restaurant. \n\n Our server was Lauren, and she was really friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered mimosas and coffee, and drinks came relatively quickly.  The menu is rather extensive with both breakfast and lunch choices. I opted to order the Scottsdale Burrito (egg whites, tomato, spinach, goat cheese and hash browns), and my boyfriend ordered the My Eggs My Way. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious! \n\nOverall, my experience with Morning Squeeze was a good one. Although they just opened, I feel like they are a very promising restaurant. I had realistic expectations that were far exceeded by the excellent service and delicious food. Will definitely come back again!"
3,Was told abt this place from a friend . Im not a Big chinese person but do like some things .. This place has the BEST Orange Chicken and Crab Puffs.. Loved the Food But service wasnt great   kinda sad   Id still go back many times  Trust me Food is Awesome   :)
4,Great place to go for lunch. Absolutely the best Italian I've had. Great atmosphere and perfect service. Love this place.
1,"Everything was perfect--the service, the timeliness, the atmosphere...\n\n...everything EXCEPT THE FOOD.\n\nI can't give a restaurant a good review if the food isn't good, especially at this price point. Here's the run-down:\n\nDRINKS: Okay, these were good. The Mulo Romano and Amore Amaro were probably highlights of the meal.\n\nWARM OLIVES: Fine. These were the highlight of the food, but the texture was a little mushy--not firm and fresh like olives should be. The orange peel garnish added a nice, unexpected element that made the dish more complex. Eat this part with the olives if you decide to order this.\n\nARANCINI: They were hard balls of bland, puffy, overcooked rice. Looking back on images that other people posted on Yelp of their Cento arancini, the kitchen must have also run out of cheese. Ours came with a light dusting of powdered parm rather than an ample melty layer of shredded cheese as is seen in another photo. \n\nSOURDOUGH WITH LOCAL BUTTER: They really play with words to make this starter sound romantic. 5 half-slices of bread come with a ball of butter in a little pool of olive oil. The flavors were one-note. It would have been nice to have salt and pepper grinders on the table so we could customize the dish ourselves. I understand that good restaurants don't offer salt and pepper on the table because the chef wants customers to experience each dish as he/she creates it, but everything else we had that night could have used some more seasoning.\n\nFRIED SQUID: Over-fried squid was rubbery. The romesco sauce was good, but it was the only source of flavor on the plate. The grilled lemons would have been a great touch if we were able to squeeze some juice out of the paper-thin slices.\n\nBLACK TAGLIATELLE: The pasta itself had a gluey, pasty texture that wasn't pleasant. I wondered if it was the squid ink, but after doing a little research post-visit, this wasn't the case. Our tagliatelle also didn't have much sauce, and what was there tasted like cream and not much else. Very bland. This was disappointing because so many Yelpers rave about this dish, and their photos show a nice golden sauce. \n\nAfter reading so many positive reviews, my man and I had greatly anticipated our visit here. But because the food was so expensive, but not good, we don't care to visit again."
4,"Excellent!\nI looked this place up after passing it a few times and liked what I'd read. So when I got the opportunity to go out without my young children (rare indeed), this is where I suggested. \nI ended up going with my father, who hates cheese. I mention this because it seemed that many many dishes include cheese in some way. However, they were perfectly willing to leave it out of dishes where it wasn't already mixed in (the asiago polenta already has cheese in, so not possible). \n\nAfter reading lots of reviews, we decided to start with the duck fat fries and deviled eggs. The eggs were pretty good. Very very cold (hurt my temperature-sensitive teeth), and the filling had quite the kick of mustard. That said, we both liked them! The fries...well, my father liked them. I wasn't crazy about them, but they weren't bad. \n\nI ordered the pork ragout. It was amazing.  I loved it. Every bite was wonderful! \nMy father ordered the beef shoulder and he liked it quite a bit as well, though he couldn't finish it in one sitting. \nI also ordered the salty sow'r as a drink. I think the giant ice cube was most of my drink. Nice way to make money, making half of the small glass a block of ice. I wasn't too fond of the taste, either. One thing I will give them is it wasn't weak.\n\nWe ended by sharing bananas foster beignets. They were larger than I expected, but aaaamazing.  My father agreed. \n\nI would definitely go back and the next time I have the opportunity to eat at a restaurant without my kids, I'm going here! I'll just order a different drink and skip the duck fat fries. Good food!"
4,I was a little nervous because I just moved out here from CA and didn't have a hairstylist. I found The Root on Yelp and I loved it. It lived up to its high rating. My hair looks amazing and the prices were reasonable. I am a customer for good!
3,Come for the happy hour! This place has got to be the BEST place to bring a first date.
3,"I love this park, first of all it's huge!  They have just about everything here (a dog park, sand volleyball courts, picnic pavilions, BBQ grills, playground, and a lot of free space with Actual Grass!). There is just about everything you would need for a great picnic or a game of football with some friends.  I usually run through here a lot and there is just a great atmosphere in the park, so check it out for yourself and have a great day!"
4,The burger was excellent. Ordered to go at the counter and it took under 10 minutes to get my food. Ill be back.
0,"WARNING!! They do not take responsibility! $1500.00 car wash. My truck had a tiny crack in the side plastic panel that makes up the entire rear side . It was underneath and not noticeable, at first glance.  Someone at this location did notice it, so he put a piece of tape on it, because he was concerned about more damage. He DID NOT WARN ME! I would have not gotten it washed! After the damage was done he came in a got me and showed me what they had done. So my $20.00 was more important to them than my truck. They are refusing responsibility. The GM  \""Tiger\"" would only refer me to the sign that says that they don't take responsibility. I hope this crappy business gets everything they deserve. I am not done pursuing this. Look out Tiger, if I have my way you might lose your Christmas bonus!"
2,"We went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. \n\nWe tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. \n\nService was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance."
1,Did a trade for a timeshare week.....HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!  They Claim these are Suites.... not even close.  Can you say False Advertizing.. ?? \n\nTiny rooms but clean... Maybe one step up from MOtel 6 as far as conditono of the rooms.... but... their daily rates are higher than Motel 6..  \n\n$4.95 per hour for Wi Fi.
1,"I have been coming to Jackson's Bar & Grill for some time...maybe 4 years now.  I used to be a semi regular on Tuesday nights (Backgammon Tournament) but haven't been impressed with the service or food.  I have been postponing doing a review hoping it would return to what I remembered from years ago...but alas it has not.\n\nMy most recent visit was a Monday night for the prime rib.  The portions are very generous, but the food quality is just good at best.  The prime rib was ordered medium, but originally served raw, not rare but RAW.  My friend who prefers it rare even commented that it was too rare for even HIM.  Two trips back to the kitchen later the prime rib had at least stopped mooing and I decided to just keep it.  The mash potatoes and gravy was served separately and now cold as the beer.  Now... beer was good and cold so that is a plus!\n\nThe dining area is somewhat separated from the bar area, but the smoke definitely makes its way back to the dining area.  I wish I would have at least posted a review with 3 Stars prior, but now I have to go with just 2 Stars and I seriously doubt I will be back to try it again, but you never know."
1,"I dont mind coming here during the day, but I try to avoid coming here later in the evening. I just always have a bad feeling about this place and the kind of crowd that come around in the evenings. Price-wise, its just like every other walmart."
1,"Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week based on the good reviews of the place.  Service was quick and friendly. Ordered a lunch combo (spicy noodle?) with tofu.  The soup that came with it was a little sad... it was about 2 spoonfuls, no kidding.  \n\nRest of the food came quickly and looked much more promising than the soup, however I took a bite of the spring roll and immediately realized that this would NOT be my #1 thai place, nor #52 on the list.\n\nThe spring roll was cold (yes, cold, not even lukewarm) and so was some of the tofu throughout the dish.  The dish itself had good flavor, but the random cold pieces of tofu were a turn off to say the least.  Disappointing meal & I won't be returning."
2,"This club is new and pretty. Used a promoter to get in for free, but she only got girls in. Sorry guys, you are on your own. Inside the club is dark and has lots of open space. The outside area I like better. There are spas and pools and tree boxes that you can sit on. You can also see the strip and it has a pretty view. Much more quite outside, so you can actually sit and talk. I was not too fond of the music they played and not much people were dancing. Getting in and out of the nightclub is kind of a nightmare! To get in- I'm only speaking from experience with my promoter, but we all had to meet downstairs and she only brought girls in as groups- not your personal group, but like a group group. She told people to meet at a certain time, and so whoever was on her list, I think she waited until all or most of them showed up then walked in about 20 or so girls at the same time. I understand that this saves her time, but you don't exactly feel VIP when it's done in that manner either. Every other club that I've had a promoter for, you went in with just the people you came with, not waiting for everyone to gather like cattle. Anyways, we met downstairs and so had to go back upstairs to get in and the entrance was wrapped around the back so I did not really like that being in heels. Also when you leave, oh geesh, talk about the worse stairs ever!! The entrance leads you to the back, like the back outside of a building! It's all metal stairs and endless amounts of them!! Every girl I saw freaked out at the stairs that lead us out and held on the the rails for dear life! Seriously, metal stairs leading to what like an outside back entrance with girls wearing like 4-5 inch heels... that's an accident waiting to happen!! They should at least put grips in the stairs or carpet somewhere so that it's not as accident prone! Just the thought of the exit makes me not want to come back to the club. \n\nMy favorite clubs hands down are XS and Tao. I think I will stick to those!!"
0,"The horrific experience that I had here a few months ago popped into my head, so I figured that I'd write a quick review. I'm happy to see that it had closed because i would NEVER have gone back.  It wasn't that the pizza was mediocre, it was that it was just plain bad.  So much so that i threw out an entire large pizza after eating just one slice.  Major disappointment."
1,"Pros\n- The food was delicious\n- The warm welcome from the staff upon entry is a very nice touch\n- Great decor\n\nCons\n- Our party of 16 was assigned a table that seated no more than 12. I had to sit sideways on the bench to accommodate everyone\n- Portions per dish are very small. Though I appreciate gourmet tapas, $10 for a fistful of spinach with a couple of mushrooms is a stretch\n- Our bill wasn't split, forcing us to divvy a $670 bill ourselves\n- One member of our party wasn't served at all after 2 hours of waiting\n- Ordering the grapefruit cocktail gets you a vodka/soda, grapefruit half and citrus juicer. Very original, but insufficient juice and less labor leaves you wondering why you paid the mark up.\n\nOverall\nMaybe the moral of our story is to avoid going in a large group. Cramped seating, divvied portions and a single bill all point towards the restaurant's inexperience in dealing with parties larger than 5. Though I loved the food, the value and the service will prevent me from re-visiting."
3,The green tamales were delicious. i walked to the Steamed Tamale because\n i work just  2 minutes away. By the time i got back to the office needless to say the tamales were gone. Worth the trip and reasonably priced. Owner/staff were very friendly. I hope they stay around.
4,Our new favorite spot!!!!! Been here a few times have ordered different things (my boyfriend and I) and have all exceeded our expectations :) Service is great and speedy. Love love love this place!
0,Over priced and no customer service.
4,"The perfect place to fill up your tummy :)\nYou have a choice of taking away or sitting in, what I like is that even if you sit in and you can't finish you can take your leftovers home. I love the fact there's a big range of different things to choose from. Fish and chips, pizza, wraps, burgers, doner meat as well as desserts AND of course deap-fried Mars bars. My favourites have to be the fishcakes, doner chicken and pizzas! Everything has so much taste. Uncles is perfect for a family day out for lunch or a catch up with a friend and the portions are pretty good! The place is clean and you can sit with their free Wi-Fi :) The staff are very friendly. A must visit for their fish & chips! I have been countless times and will continue that way :)"
0,"This place has a \""dress code\"" which I noticed only applies to people of color. I was turned away at the door on a slow night and I saw 2 white men dressed the same as me: t-shirt, sneakers, and a jacket. All my clothes are in great condition. Glad I didn't have an opportunity to waste my money here."
4,"Awesome twist on Tapas style.  I loved the flavor adventure I had at Yonaka, everything was very delicious.  The service was excellent, we received the food in a timely manner and the servers were very friendly and informative.  I think that wasabi and ginger should be served with the sushi rolls, that is my only \""gripe\"".  I highly recommend Yonaka to anyone looking for flavor outside the norm."
3,Fast and convenient.
4,"spend some good amount of time at this place, and very friendly people, and the customer service is very good."
4,"Unfortunately, this gem of a store is closing. However, everything is now 50% off which is amazing. They have truly beautiful pieces of classic furniture and accessories. Seriously, I've been schooling myself on interior design for the past month (i.e. obsessively reading the blogs of top designers) and when I walked in here last weekend I was in HEAVEN!"
0,"My friend warned me about Spirit Airlines. It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here. I decided that the one time I would be on Spirit Airlines is for a quick flight from LAX to Vegas. It would only take 45 minutes and it will be worth the price. I can deal with the worn out seats, the cramped space, and the additional charges for luggage because I know that it is a discount airline. They will nickel and dime you ($100.00 +) for additional luggage carry on. It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.\n\nThe plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \n\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\n\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \n\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. \n\nOn another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US. I just hope they look into replacing their airplane engines if they are honestly the fastest growing airline."
0,"No stars-zero!The glass company M&M damaged my windshield.I inspected it prior to getting out of my car because the worker looked suspicious to me.When I stepped out of my vehicle,the Francis and Sons employee directed my attention to my back seat as he went through his sales pitch.As I was about to go into the waiting area,the sketchy M&M employee asked me if I had full coverage and directed me to the passenger side windshield where there was now obvious damage.It is very evident by the tiny hole in the middle if the fine size crater,that a sharp object was pushed or tapped in.I brought this to the attention of Sam the manager of Francis and Sons who immediately defended the glass company and stated how it's not any if his responsibility because they are a separate company.I called the police and while I waited, the manager of the M&M glass came to me and tried to say his employee could not have done it.He saud,\""If you were smart enough,you would know that it takes 80 lbs if pressure to do damage to that glass\"".I called the police.The Gilbert officer went into the Francis and Sons manager's office and viewed the video tape.He told me that the cameras point AWAY from the front of the vehicle.In fact,they point toward the street!he said he could not make a report because there is no proof or witnesses....I could go after them in law suit but he couldn't do anything.Nice little gig they have going there.Im sure they get away with it all the time.They could have done more damage or stolen something, be ware!"
3,Great Food and Fun. We tried them when they were at Carefree Brix Wine Bar. Had never done a food truck before and the lamb with salad was really great. Looking forward to seeing them again in Cave Creek.
0,"Terrible service at a recent visit.  It was a Monday around 7ish and my co-worker and I walked in to this place.  We didn't have a reservation as we just flew in to town.  But we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good.  Asked the hostess for a table for 2.  She said the wait time will be about 30 minutes.  And we're like OK no problem.  Then we saw the empty tables outside as well.  So I asked her again if the wait time is still 30 minutes if we are to sit outside?  Surprisingly she still said yes.  So we're out there sitting and after about 30 minutes she comes out and asks \""oh did you want to just eat out here?\"".  And we're like - uhmmm yeah???  Unless I was speaking Martian, I swear I remember telling her that some 30 mins earlier.  I decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon.  My buddy got the steak.  He said the steak was disappointingly dry.  The salmon I had was too greasy.  Very lousy food.  In my opinion I can maybe cut them some slack on the lousy food if their service wasn't terrible.  Why the F would they let us sit outside for 30 mins with 10s of empty tables?  Is it because we're too casual for their \""crowd\""?  Maybe because were not wearing suits?  Or maybe they just don't give a F*** about people who just walk in without a reservation?  This used to be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Madison.  This is now on my must-avoid and do-not-recommend list."
4,"I'm a huge fan of Penn & Teller in general, and I'm a huge fan of magic, so I booked tickets for this when I was in Vegas. We had a great time, the show was really good. Some of the tricks were astounding, like the bullet catch. Definitely made the right choice for my Vegas entertainment.\n\nIt's been said before, but I'll say it again. Penn and Teller are wonderful people for staying afterwards and taking pictures and signing things for EVERYONE. They're great guys who put on a great show. If you're a fan of magic, go. If you're a fan of them, DEFINITELY go."
2,The environment is clean with a spacious dining area. \n\nThere is a wide menu selection of seafood items \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\n\n1) Yang chow fried rice with BBQ pork and shrimp.\n\n2) Fillet fish with vegetables\n\n3) Sesame chicken\n\n4) Half duck\n\nMy favorites were the fried rice and sesame chicken. The taste of each dish is average.
1,"For the life of me I don't understand why this place is so popular, or how could it be possibly anything \""best.\""\nIt's a block away from my work, and I came here once in 2 years because I lost my mind that one day (no, because my lunch mate wanted to eat there and I was being a nice friend armed with a coupon... paying full price for this place should be a crime).\nIt's so packed on any given day, thus it's not per se the best \""quick bite\"" option. Because it is so packed, service isn't stellar either (granted the waitress I had was sweet and nice hence I gave 2 instead of 1 star). So in order for it to be \""best lunch\"" you would think the food is out of this world?! NOPE. I had a French Dip, and the best part was the au jus. It's a sandwich shop and the sandwich wasn't good. Roast beef (on menu it said it was home roasted) was dry and plain. And for the crazy amount of money you're paying for the sandwich/wrap, you get a bag of chips and a cup of soup if you dine in. \nMaybe someone can explain to me the appeal of this place, but seriously, go to Harris Teeter and get a sub, it's better, cheaper, faster and more."
2,Since my kids went to ASU I have wanted to try this place meaning the restaurant because there are many locations.   I know your suppose to go at 3am not 3pm but I got there. Shared taquitos with guacamole and had my first Horchada.  I usually don't like these kinda drinks but I enjoyed it anyway.  I would go back at 3am or 3pm .
4,"No special request is too special for John.  Even a soy allergy can be handled in this awesome sushi restaurant.  Don't eat shell fish, but still want sushi?  No problem.  John's is the best hands down."
1,"So I decided to bring a friend here for his birthday last night. There were four of us. Three of us ordered the Kiki's Burger, the other got the spicy miso burger. All of the burgers had good flavor. The problem is with temperature, my wife ordered hers medium rare, as she always does, but one half of the burger looked as if it had barely even touched the grill. I know raw hamburger when I see it, it was raw. The server apologized and said she would show it to the boss. She then returned and said the boss responded that my wife needs to order medium next time. I have been in the restaurant business for a long time, that is not how you respond to a complaint. They sent a complimentary desert to apologize, fine. The server then dropped the check without the burger on it, I thought that was great, I didn't ask they just made it right...WRONG! After I put the money in the check book to pay, the server returned and said \""I'm sorry, she made me add the burger back on.\"" Needless to say, I will never visit this establishment again, they treat customers wrong and I would rather spend my money where it is appreciated. I will also stop recommending it to friends, which I used to do frequently. You lost a loyal customer Bachi Burger...nice going."
3,"We did not have to pay for tickets and the guy that bought them got a Black Friday deal so we had some decent seats. How can you complain about a free show?\n\n   The visuals and aerials were incredible. They left me thinking about the performance a week later. The music is from the slower songs by the Beatles. Even though I was familiar with them, my girlfriend was not.  \n\n   There is so much happening at once that it was easy to become overwhelmed to the point I lost track of the story they were trying to tell; however the stage was specifically built for this act so I concentrated on that and was amazed by just the technical aspects.  There is a behind the scenes tour that I would love to check out."
3,"We were in town for a concert and planning on staying at a friends.  At the last minute we decided to book a hotel so we could have a pool to use.  I Pricelined a 5 star hotel at the Northend of the strip and got the Trump for $110.  We were kind of bummed at first but everything was great.  We checked in early and were able to upgrade to a suit for $50 more.  The rooms were very nice, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  We had no problem getting the double lounge chair by the pool but the bar/resturant was under staffed and took a while for drinks.. Its a pretty small pool area but was nice bc it was smoke free!! Over all great deal!! and would be good for low keys couples who want to be off the strip and dont gamble and families."
1,"Owner/chef Joseph Keller is the co-founder with his brother Thomas of Napa Valley's Buchon. His brother also operates the highly acclaimed French Laundry, Buchon at the Venetian and Per Se. Based on this dining experience, Joseph apparently is the less talented of Mrs. Keller's sons. Our meal started off with a white bean, anchovy, garlic and EVO spread delivered to our table with hot rolls. My wife opted for the crispy skin salmon served with cippolini onions, Peruvian potatoes, kalamata and asparagus tips in a sundried tomatoes tapenade. I chose the roasted chicken over garlic spinach accompanied by Joseph's signature French fries. I believe Heidi, the Review Journal's restaurant reviewer, must have based her rating on these fries because we found both entrees to be unremarkable."
1,"Well.\n\nI am unsure if this place has good prices for their products as I was picking up a gift card for my neice, and I have to say, some of their \""standard\"" prices seemed higher than other places.\n\nI toured the hair products for men, and prices were at least 20-25% higher than all other places I have seen and from where I purchased.\n\nIs this a good place?? not too sure - as it is catered to women, but I sure do hope my neice utilizes the gift card on a sale item.  Guess that is the only way you get your money's worth."
1,"Plus - cabby got me home in record time.  \n\nMinus - it wasn't without a fair amount of drama.  Driver was aggressive to anyone who was in his way or didn't move fast enough, slowing down to give dirty looks to anyone who displeased him.  When we arrived at Aria he almost got in a fight with a limo driver who he mean mugged for no reason.  You have a choice in this town.  i'll turn these guys down from now on.  These cabbies always complain there is not enough work.  Then when they get it, they do this?"
0,"Where to start with this review?\n\nWe went with Hertz because I did the Name Your Own Price option on Priceline, which up until this experience, had been quite beneficial for saving money, however I would not recommend this feature for rental cars because you may end up with Hertz.\n\nThe Charlotte Douglas airport location is fine as far as how easy it is to get to and the shuttle arrival and departure times. However, the people who run this location are entirely incompetent. \n\nFirst problem: Since I already had a reservation, I was forced to use this extremely bizarre video chat system where I picked up what equaled a pay phone and video chatted with a representative. This was while there were available representatives on site. The manager who \""dialed\"" the rep didn't explain the process at all.\n\nThe representative I spoke to was fine, but she misled me and tried to up-sell me twice and then completely lost interest in helping me when she realized she wasn't going to make her sales quota through me. This whole process was entirely confusing and I don't know why a company would EVER consider doing this. \n\nSecond problem: We were told where are car was parked, and although there were reps available, no one took us to where the car was. They just kind of pointed and said, \""It's near the fence.\"" Um, the entire place is surrounded by a fence! \n\nThird problem: They gave us no inspection paperwork. We had to get in the car, drive around and ask for it and then inspect the car ourselves. They took the paperwork afterwards, but who knows what they did with it!\n\nFourth problem: We returned the car 1 hour late, which meant we incurred a $30 fee for a late return. I understand that this is the policy, but didn't know before hand. The manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate. Tough luck for me since I already swore up and down that I would never rent from Hertz again.  I resolved to call when I returned home.\n\nFifth problem: I called and emailed customer service about my charge. WHen I finally got a hold of someone, they told me that there was nothing they could do since I already accepted the gift certificate, and because I accepted it, it meant that I agreed the issue was resolved.\n\nThat's when I was really incensed since no one ever said that by accepting the certificate that I agreed I was OK with being charged $30/hour. Because I most certainly was not! As a \""goodwill\"" gesture, she reduced my fee by a whopping $15.38.\n\nConsider this your fair warning. If I could give this company zero stars, I would. Go with Enterprise instead. You'll probably pay more, but at least you won't have to deal with Hertz."
0,Walked in with my wife and we were the youngest ones their amidst senior citizens and decided to leave.  So I have no idea what the food or service is like.
4,"Me and my husband used Free Vegas Club passes this past weekend and had a great time no trouble at all We went to Rehab Saturday and went to Tao that night,  Definitely gonna use it again when we go back to Vegass again Thanks Chris our Anniversary weekend was truly amazing             Sasha and Eric Hernandez"
0,"We were excited to eat here, it is difficult to find. They were closed at 3 p.m. on a Saturday."
0,This was the first time that we have eaten at Babbo and we opted for take-out. No complaints about the staff they were all nice...but oh my goodness...the food...one word sums it up...blech. We both ordered the chicken marinara sandwiches which we later found out were no longer on the menu at this location...and we decided to split an order of spaghetti and marinara. I asked for some extra marinara sauce for my sandwich...I asked for it on the side as in a small container...it was on my sandwich and it made it too messy to pick up. My first bite nearly made me fall off my chair...the focaccia bread was so salty that the roof of my mouth was burning...and each subsequent bite was the same...I tried scraping it off the bottom but it was too far baked into the bread to do that. Now everyone who knows me knows that I salt salt...that is not a typo...salt is a food group for me...they really over did this spice. The chicken was tough and tasteless. The spaghetti with marinara sauce actually needed some salt...or some taste...it too was awful. We do take-out four or five nights a week and the food is always fine..we never have any complaints no matter what we order...I am watching my husband tidy up and there is a ton of food left...he asked what I wanted him to do with it and I said throw it all out...he normally eats the leftovers but he doesn't want any of it. I have a stomach ache from all of the salt and my mouth still feels weird from it. Why so much salt on bread? I have a heart condition and high blood pressure. I think if people want salt it should be their choice to add it...this was our first and our last visit to Babbo. My husband is more tolerant than I am about bad food...I told him he could probably save all of the chicken that I didn't eat and put it on a sub roll for lunch tomorrow...he said no thanks...and he just remarked that it was about as disappointing a meal as you can get. Wish I could give it a bunch of minus stars. Blech. blech...blech!
2,The atmosphere is really cool but the options were not that great. I got a veggie sandwich and it was not that great.
0,"Place is dated. There are always multiple machines broken and when machines break, they are not repaired for quite a long period of time.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority. I inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response.   Do not join unless you get tour with manager  and discuss maintenance with manager and get comfortable the situation will change.  You do get access at other clubs around country, so I am able to go to other 24 hour fitness facilities and have found other facilities much more acceptable."
3,"This store  has everything you need to be crafty. Sometimes it is hard to find what you are looking for or someone to help you find it. When you do find someone to help you though, they are great. The staff is knowledgable and friendly, there just needs to be more of them!"
0,Literally waited an hour and half to get service. Food was decent but not for $50 a plate. Very dissapointed
1,"We stopped for dinner want to have a steak.  The mash potatoes and salad were good, but the steak was tough and of low quality..  The price of the food didn't match the quality of the food"
0,Really bad service. Make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored
2,Papa Dells pizza pales in comparison to real deep dish pizza. The crust is very thick and not flavorful. The sausage and pepperoni toppings aren't anything special. I do enjoy the amount of cheese they put on their pizza. If you want the Chicago pizza experience don't waste your time here or money.
4,"The only place I'll stay in Vegas. Of all the casinos I've visited (Cosmopolitan included) this place has the most class. The decor is stunning. Lush red ceilings, gold chandeliers, and beautiful floral carpeting. Somehow  achieves the casino feel without bathing the room in darkness. The well-lit interior really lends itself to making friends (and good for them, staying up later gambling). Also, in my opinion, XS is the best of the Vegas clubs. Though XS is in the Wynn part, staying at hotel will get you reduced entrance to both before midnight. Go in, get stamped, then head back out to pregame/gamble.\n\nTake me back to vegas"
0,So nice of them to close while they are currently offering a deal on Living Social. Don't forget to request a refund if you recently purchased yours!
4,"This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.  \n\nThe breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had! I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb!\n\nI should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.  The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however,  would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items!\n\nI will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon.  I advise you to do the same!"
3,"Very good pizza and service, impressed so i went back the next weekend and ordered 3 more pizzas. Friends liked them too. Favorite so far is the delux and then the pepperoni"
3,"This is a great little place.   It is located on the royal mile, the street you take to get to the castle.   \nThe waiter we had was very friendly and helpful. Iglesias gave good recommendations and his thoughts on the menu items.  \nHe took excellent care of us even though he was extremely busy.  \nI had the haggis with nipps and tats aid haggis with turnips and mashed potatoes.  \nMy partner had the pulled pork pizza.   Both items were very well priced and filling.   \nWe will stop back in here before we head home."
2,"While I get that it's a great bookstore, I don't understand why everyone thinks it's the best. More than once, they've not had newer books I was looking for (that should have been easy enough to find) and the staff seem elitist and stuffy, as if I'm not \""Green\"" enough to shop there, and were never around when I actually needed help.\nThis is a great place if you're into, for lack of a better word, Hippy things. But not the non-materialistic Hippy, more like the \""I have so much money that I don't need to buy mass produced things\"" Hippy.\nThe best part about this store is that they have a ton of events and seem to be really involved in the community. They also have a ton of unique and/or handmade gift items - a huge portion of the store is dedicated to this - but make sure to have a lot of disposable cash because it's all expensive.\nBesides events or out of sheer boredom, I wouldn't go out of my way to shop here."
0,"Every time I go here something gets stolen.  First it was my friends purse, then the next time it was my friends jacket.   Last night it was my jacket along with my other friends jacket.   I have no idea what is going on here but everyone agrees this place is shady and at this point it seems too coincidental. Beware and good luck."
3,"Food was amazing. So crowded for a Sunday at two. We were just picking up goo and they forgot a taco, but quickly refunded us out money."
1,"My mom didn't know this was a chain when she sat down or she would've selected someone else for me to join her and others... overall it was a 2 star experience. It took forever to get coffee and then refills and that's not acceptable in my book when in Vegas on 3 hours of sleep. \nThe french toast was fine, nothing more/nothing less. This is not a breakfast place.... I have enjoyed lunch at their Denver location."
0,"was beyond disappointed. Friendly check in but the room was a small box of a room, the view was nonexistant, the shower had no water pressure, couldnt get decent reception much less my wifi on my cell, and to top it off when i asked for a receipt i was not given one. \""we dont offer a receipt if nothing has been billed\"" but yet charged me 50 as a resort deposit.  What resort??? All they have is a lonely starbucks and a lackluster pool. Id rather stay in the bates motel then stay here ever again!"
2,We go here when their competitor gets crowded. When we got there we were seated  promptly. The food here have alway been fresh and consistent but this time it wasn't so. Most buffets start out strong then lose its luster over time. This place is getting there.  I noticed my sushi was packed with a lot of rice. I was kinda full upon ordering the second round but that didn't stop me.  Also the sweet shrimp was a little fishy but it didn't cause any havoc to my tummy.  I hope the owner reads this because we really like this place.
4,"I adore this restaurant. We frequented this restaurant for the two years I was in grad school. It is one of the many things I miss about living in Phoenix. Any time I am working or driving through Phoenix, I make sure to stop here at this location and get my fill of hot, spicy, amazing New Mexican food! I return to Phoenix in March, for work, and you can bet that I will make a few visits to Los Dos Molinos for their awesome food!"
0,"The positives?  The easy to look at hostesses/waitresses and lavish las vegas styling.  The negatives? This place is a misleading and stupid.  \n\nWe were reeled in because it was \""Happy Hour\"" & the hostess said appetizers are half price and the drink specials are two for one draft beers or 2 for 1 stoli or patron.\n\nSo, we sit down at the bar lounge area and order a beer thinking we could get two drinks for the price of one and order half price appetizers.\n\nEnds up we were not allowed to order half price appetizers because there was a miscommunication between the hostess and waitress.\nTheir mistake but the staff/management didn't care.\n\nFine, we're thirsty and want some beers.  I'll order two beers for my good friend & I, for the price of one per the happy hour special.  The waitress brings us four (4) drinks for the price of two!  WTF?!  The waitress undeftly explains that each person has to pay for a drink to get the special two for one price!  Who's heard of such lunacy?  The terms and conditions, i.e. the fine print, weren't available to us upon entering this establishment.  We felt slighted & swindled.\n\nFirst Food & Bar stands for them being first, leaving the customers a distant second."
2,"Seems like every doughnut is hit or miss. Some will be great, and some will be mediocre at best. And they are just way too pricey. I got four doughnuts and it was between $8 and $9."
2,I've been to the Henry three or four times already and even though the food is good (nothing too spectacular).. It is quite pricey for what you get. I do enjoy sitting on their beautiful patio but watch out for those bug bites. I left that place with 4 mosquito bites.\nNot sure if it will be my top pick on restaurants that I will revisit.. But we will see.
2,I gave it 3 stars the food is good but eff those prices Wtf 8 dollars for beans and rice .. no I would never come back I even went during brunch when it was a deal but nope 70 bucks for 2 of us ... Money is not an issue but that's toonmich for this kind of food .. do not come here and spend stupid money go to Bonita michoacon down the st it's way better and he'll of a lot cheaper
0,"Tried lots of cupcake/fancy cake stores around the valley- and this doesn't even come close. They are charging \""Caketini\"" and \""Sprinkles\"" prices for cupcakes that taste better at Fry's or Safeway. Yuck. My daughter wouldn't even finish hers- and she LOVES cupcakes. Normal size cakes- not worth the money. Dry and overcooked. ick. We all walked out thinking they won't last more than 6 months. Small storefront- but very clean. Owners were friendly. We will not return."
1,"How this place has 4 stars I do not understand. I can totally get into a \""mom and pop\"" style breakfast place, but Three Sisters is just plain dirty. The carpet is filthy, booths are tearing, and the place is just lacking in basic upkeep. \n\nNow to the food: it's not the worst I've ever had, but a far cry from the best. I had the 2, 2, 2, 2 (eggs with 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links and 2 pancakes). The eggs were cooked well and the sausage links were actually very good. But the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy. The pancakes were pretty tasty, though. My boyfriend ordered eggs with bacon and toast and complained about the same things. His eggs were under cooked and the bacon was again, soggy. The toast was fine but how can you really mess up toast?\n\nService was super slow. I think it took 40 minutes for us to get our food which is outrageous. The food was also kind of pricey for what you get. Our meal was $18 and probably should have cost around $12. Not to mention the surprise that they don't take credit cards. There aren't any signs posted anywhere that they only accept cash, they don't even post it on the menu. Plus the closest place to grab some cash is to walk down to the PDQ and use their ATM, absolutely ridiculous! I definitely won't be returning anytime soon."
4,"Great wings, stiff pour and nice bartenders. XO Baer's Den 'till we meet again!"
3,"Horrible food (except the garlic bread, that was actually pretty good!).  It's annoying that they only take cash, I feel like this is 1995 again.   It's also annoying you have to go to two sections to order your drinks, you can't order them with your meal.\n\nHOWEVER, it's cheap entertainment.   Have a little kid? Spend $25, take the family here, they will enjoy it."
1,"After hearing everyone and their brother go on about how excellent Pink Taco is, I have to say that there must be another one somewhere else in town that's good.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good, either. It was average. The waitstaff was okay. The mediocre food came out quickly.\n\nThere are much better places in town."
4,"Yama Sushi is my favorite sushi joint until I can find better. Most of the specials are tasty and the nigiri is good. My faves are man whore, sun of the beach, and something else with crunchy eel. Their seafood salad is excellent I could just drink up the sauce haha. Gyoza is good, yakitori is good, mussels are okay. I thought both the soft shelled crab and deep fried mussels were tasteless. I think the worst item they serve is the BBQ Beef. It is thin beef shortrib that is super chewy and rubbery and tastes like salty garlic. I hope they improve on it - at least grill it.\n\nI appreciate the excellent customer service no matter how busy it gets. An even better fact is that you can have as much ice cream\nand mochi ice cream as you want."
1,Short Sum: Inexpensive and overrated desserts. Small location with a long wait. No.\n\nPros: \n- Clean and pretty.\n\nCons: \n- Desserts were not worth it. $10 Ice Cream dish with 2 chocolate dipped strawberries? Not worth it. \n- Frozen hot chocolate for more than $10? Not worth it either.\n- I don't know why it felt really cramped. \n- Long wait.\n\nGo Back?\n- This review is solely on the desserts. I'll come back to try their food and maybe adjust my rating.
4,Awesome food and great service. Thanks Rob and Stefano.
1,We decided to check this place out since it looked like a casual dining spot and was close to our hotel. My sis and I weren't too hungry so we ordered the fondue pretzel dippers which I do not recommend. We had thought it would be a soft pretzel but they turned out to be those hard pretzel sticks you can buy at a cvs. Gross. Also the accompanying cheese dip was too salty for my taste. Giving this place an extra star only because our waitress was nice
2,"Pretty fun themed casino like out of Camelot, but with all the modern amenities. This I would say is one of the easier hotels to get lost in though as far as Vegas goes. Unlike many other hotels in Vegas though, I'm not a fan of many of their dining options. The Beware of the \""body snatchers\"" prevalent at this property who REALLY press you for the time share sell. While dated, it's still a fun place to kill a few hours."
3,"Despite the rumored facial recognition monitoring system keeping repeat customers from coming back, we made it in last night again. Despite Howard's depressing opinion of his act and club, we love going to Stand Up Scottsdale. However, we are the nimrods that have kids and smaller stacks of money than single people. We manage to laugh our asses off despite the place being a little rough around the edges, but I think the point of a comedy club is to laugh - not to be pampered. \n\nI just realized that I used the word \""despite\"" a lot here and I think I know why. This club is fun!  I always have a good time. Howard gets good talent on stage. The high rating it gets here is earned. However, there's one thing that I would recommend you do Howard. Please cut back on the \""don't come back\"" routine. Don't get me wrong, as a parent, I fully get the value of reverse psychology. However, in your case it isn't working for me because it's boring. It's the same routine each time. Mix it up a bit. Drop the sad sack bit and go back to euthanasia jokes or something you can sink your teeth into. \n\nWe will be back!"
3,Free coffee while you wait! Food looked and tasted fantastic!
0,"The waiter was fast and attentive.  However, the food was disgusting.  I ordered the beef brisket sandwich.  It was bone dry and cooked to the point if being like leather.  I ate mid afternoon.  I suspect the meat was under a warming lamp for some hours."
2,I agree with what other reviewers are saying when it comes to the quality of food.  While it does not blow me away it is not that bad or should I say consistently average.  I have not disliked anything I have had here.  The servers are always friendly and attentive and seem to handle really large groups very well.  The bar is pretty cool and they do make a really good margarita:).
0,"Pretty good, but food wasn't very fresh. I kinda felt sick afterward...but it was a lot of choices...and good if you just want taste and not quality."
3,CLOSED?!! DEAR GOD WHY???\n\nThis was my favorite buffet ever. The food was always good. The staff were always super awesome. I miss this place.. They had the best rice too..
3,"I came to this trendy yet casual restaurant for happy hour (Sun-Fri from 5:30pm - 7:00pm).  To order off the happy hour menu, you have sit at the cocktail tables or the bar.  Because the kitchen is open, you can see the chefs preparing your food, which is always legit.  That being said, I was quite surprised and alarmed to see the chefs eating in the kitchen while preparing the food.  Service was lightning fast, as I was in and out within a half hour.\n\nTime to get happy.\n\nThe white sangria ($5), which also comes in red, was awesome and was so good that I was forced to order another one.\n\nThe raw oysters in a half shell ($2 each) were sold by the half dozen and came with every dipping sauce under the sun.  I've had a lot of oysters in my day and I highly recommend checking these out.\n\nThe stuffed clams ($5) were ginormous.  Stuffed with chorizo, they were served with grilled buttered bread.  The clams were simply amazing.  \nWith just the right amount of salty and savory, they were smooth in texture and easy to chew.\n\nNow for the most expensive appetizer ever.  The poppers ($22) weren't on the happy hour menu and came with 3 tuna balls and 3 yellowtail balls, each served raw on top of fried rice patties.  These bad boys lived up to their name and were small enough to pop in your mouth.  Though not worth the price, they were still pretty dank.\n\nFocus on the seafood at this place and definitely enjoy!"
3,"Il Fornaio was conveniently located in the downstairs of my room in NYNY and, after walking by it several times, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there on December 23rd.  \n\nFirst, our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.\n\nSecond, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance. \n\nThird, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  \n\nWhat did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  \n\nIf there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.  By the time dessert came, I was full beyond comfort and had to pack it up.  \n\nOverall - I enjoyed the dining experience at Il Fornaio and would recommend it to everyone (who isn't on the Atkins diet!!!!)"
0,"If I could give you NO stars I would. I went there on a thursday night at 9:15pm.  The tables were full but there were 5 seats at the bar. The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place.\nThere are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to."
3,"Selling upper class jewellery of a high quality, Pebbles is nevertheless edgy and contemporary.\n\nMixing traditional styles with new materials and designs, their range of jewellery is eyecatching as well as being elegant. Lending inspiration from a variety of era's, the pieces come together to form a very unusual and striking accessory.\n\nPrices and styles vary according to what you're going for. Some of the designers such as Stagg are expensive, but undoubtedly worth it as the pretty but durable bracelets look like they'd last a lifetime. Some pieces look delicate, while others lean towards statement jewellery.\n\nThey have ranges for men, women and children. Pebbles cater for wedding accessories as much as gifts, but have some delicious rings and necklaces if you're looking to spoil yourself. It's expensive and unfortunately I don't have the cash to burn, but if I did I would set it alight in Pebbles. A wonderful anchor necklace has stolen my heart. I'm sure something will steal yours, too."
2,"Happy hour is great here at this restaurant....However you can tell they are part of a big chain working to cut costs where they can.....We tried dinner there last night....The Filet was very dry for med rare ....I have had better on my own grill purchased from a local grocery.....The shrimp cocktail is supposed to be huge shrimp as an appetizer for $17.00 and these were quite small, .the kind you would find commonly anywhere. with no flavor...The single loaf of bread was cold and the outside of it was not crispy....The butter options were good though....My other half enjoyed the salmon and it was cooked perfectly...Overall for the price of dinner, I would not go back....HOWEVER I would do happy hour there again.....The happy hour menu is good and the prices are great.... I DO WANT TO SAY THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT ARE IMPECCABLE....TRAINED WELL AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INSURE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST IT CAN BE....."
3,"$20/person? The money goes to charity and in return you get to gorge yourself on cupcakes? Mmmmm....let me think....yes!\n\nWent to the Cupcake Love-In for the first time this year and enjoyed every sugary bite.\n\nTwo rooms full of different cupcake vendors, eager to serve you a sample of their sweet treats. I have no idea how many cupcakes I actually ate. I lost count after room 1. \n\nThe best cupcakes were the unusual ones. Sure there were great vanilla and chocolate but if you can put prosciutto and fig into a cupcake and make it work, you're the winner in my book (looking at you Bourbon Steak).\n\nThe only bummer was that a lot of places ran out really early! Event started at 11:00 and by 11:30 places were already out of some things. So we missed getting to try a few that sounded interesting. One place had one with avocado but they were out by the time I got there. :( The event was scheduled to go until 2. I feel bad for anyone that came after noon, really.\n\nBut a good venue, great cupcakes and a good cause. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday."
0,"Dr. Lepore is amazing. Expertise, bedside manner, etc: amazing. The rest of the operation, however, is not.\n\nKidfixers stops being spectacular as soon as you attempt to contact them outside the office. If you call them during business hours they will not pick up. So you leave a message that they will never respond to. Sometimes they leave hilariously frustrating messages like \""Call back during business hours.\"" After you called and left a message first thing in the morning. They do this consistently day after day. \n\nIf your kid gets sick just take them in, if you can get worked in, and if you do there's an extremely good chance you'll not see Dr. Lepore, who is the whole reason you should go here. If you try and call the emergency line, even for something basic like a mild fever, they're answer is going to be \""make an appointment.\"" So just go in.\n\nAnd should a pharmacy or insurance representative call or fax the office do not worry, the staff consistently and thoroughly ignores all these requests. So should even the slightest hiccup occur with anything, Kidfixers will forget you exist.\n\nDr. Lepore is a great physician, however his clinic cannot be relied on to do anything. I would recommend this place to people who enjoy waiting days to never be contacted while their children suffer with treatable illnesses."
2,"If you get in for free, this is a great attraction.  There are coupon books in cabs and what not that have tickets.  AAA also gets you in for free, I think.  I just read on Yelp that the auto collection website might even have a free offer.\n\nIf paying $10 is the only option, I would recommend going if you really like cars.  Probably not the best place to take the uninterested wife/girlfriend.  The reason for that is that the setting itself isn't all that nice.  Have you been to the Imperial Palace?  If it were in the Bellagio or Venetian, I probably wouldn't feel the same way.\n\nAnyway, there is a nice collection of classic cars and some are for sale.  The museum is pretty large (the whole 5th floor) and there are some famous \""Vegas\"" vehicles on display."
2,"Tom's really went downhill when it merged with Folino's. Now the food is way overpriced, and the ambience of the former location is gone. It's still the go-to place for food on the south side at 4 a.m., but it will never be the same as it once was."
2,"Yes I'm reviewing this....why not?  Just an Scottish version of a Hooters bar, whats not to love.\n\nBut of course, the food as expected isn't all that great, but the ladies are shall I say, have nice outfits and truly warm up to you.  Cheers to ASU.  Heck, you even get a collectors card to take home and show your wife and kids.  \n\nFor the upside, at least it made my trip to Tempe somewhat memorable, even though it required venturing outside to Phoenix for a drink and grub.  Just a 30 min travel away and 2 transfers.  \n\nFor the food:\n\n-Garlic Fries - bleh, although its the skinnier type fries, no one does it better than Gordon Biersch\n\n-Spinach Dip - bland and too chunky\n\n-Grilled Buffalo Wings - I got like 3 that were burnt, and although its supposedly different from the deep fried type, they were just like the ones you cook on the bbq, except .....more burnt.  I didn't enjoy it that much I had myself to blame since I was craving wings for some reason.\n\n-Side of Dublin Stew - Probably the one thing I'm glad I got since it was sort of like a Shepards Pie in stew form.  Tasty and pretty filling.\n\nAs for the drinks:\n\n-After all, the bar was just calling out to me and although I had hoped to see more beers on tap, unfortunately, a majority of their beer list was bottled.  I went with the Kilt Lifter...something that sounded rather appropriate which turned out to be like an IPA but toned down and had a sweeter taste like that of a Hef."
1,This place is not clean!  Had my nails done there yesterday but noticed that the nail stations and towels were dirty.  My nails look good but if I get fungus I will sue.  I won't be back.
1,"Uh. I was SO looking forward to you, PH, after seeing you in so many movies...but alas, you disappointed! My sister and I go to Vegas once every couple of years. She lives in Baltimore, I live in Boston, so I meet her down in her neck of the woods and after Thanksgiving we get on a plane to Vegas, baby! We've stayed in many hotels here over the years. I heard good things about Planet Hollywood and wanted to give it a try. \n\nFirst of all, this place is DARK...even for Vegas. LOTS of dark wood panelling, and the main hotel is definitely beginning to look outdated despite renovations and the tower addition. Maybe my room would be different? Meh. Was it awful? No. Was it anything to write home about? No. It was clean (except the table..there was some type of residue...glass tables in a Vegas hotel room are just ASKING for trouble, if you know what I mean...I can't imagine the things housekeeping has to scrape off after a looonnggg night/morning of partying). My sister's friend met us and she was obviously is a room that had NOT been renovated. Ay yai yai....I would def have asked to move if I were here. Striped walls and a mattress that was lopsided. Looked 20 years too late.\n\nI'm not sure what it is, but even some of the hotels older than PH have a \""newer\"" feel to them. Something feels kind of grimy about PH...maybe it has to do with all the dark wood panelling, but I can't say I was impressed with anything :(\n\nI WILL say the location is EXCELLENT and very centralized to the strip- location wise you can't get much better. While I wouldn't *not* stay here if it was heavily discounted/ or someone else was paying for it, I would not stay here again. Just my opinion! Nothing wonderful, but nothing bad. It's Vegas, so you want it to be exciting, which a lot of the other hotels do a good job with."
3,"Went here with my roommate last week for a late breakfast and was pleasantly surprised! I got the Eggs Benedict and a chocolate croissant while my roommate went for the French toast with fresh fruit. Everything was very tasty, although my roommate could have easily handled a larger portion. \nAll the employees were super sweet and the French owner's eclectic playlist really added to how much I enjoyed the experience. Will have to go again for lunch or dinner!"
1,"I have frequented this Chili's a couple of times. The very first time I visited I was thoroughly impressed. Our waiter was genuine and so friendly. I have a daughter with special needs and often times when we go out wait staff tends to be stand offish, but not this gentleman. I wish I could remember his name but I did ask for the manager and gave a raving review at the time of our visit. The second and third times I went here I was not as impressed. The wait staff was not nearly as friendly and the last time I went there I seriously felt like my daughter and I were an inconvenience even though we were the only people in the restaurant for a good 20 minutes. The food is always good however, and I will more than likely still return."
0,"How do you mess up a grilled cheese? I don't know but this place did. It smelled like fish! The fries were mediocre, but at least they smelled like fries. Plan to go elsewhere to eat after you see a show here."
2,This is my go to breakfast joint in the area. I give this place 3 stars only because there isn't a wow factor and parking sucks on Saturdays or maybe it's because I am from the south and we have a different standard for breakfast. They have a solid biscuit and gravy. Overall good.
4,FABULOUS! Food is amazing! I got the teriyaki steak! And the service is wonderful! Very friendly staff and quick too. Prices were good for the quality of food they serve! Will be going back for sure! Highly highly recommend !
2,"When my roommate and I walked into 1900 Mexican, I remember being taken aback by the chic design (especially the chandeliers, OMG I covet the chandeliers) and thinking that I hoped the food and the service were as excellent as the decor because if they were then this was going to be a 5 star experience.\n\nIf wishes were fishes we'd all eat well. As it was, we ate passably.\n\nLike many mexican restaurants they started us off with chips and salsa, which came in two forms, standard red and corn. I hoped the latter would wow me, but it was pretty bland. But, hey, it was free.\n\nThe drinks, on the other hand, were most certainly not at $9 a piece. I know better than to order anything containing the ingredient \""margarita mix\"" but i let the spirit get the best of me and ended up with a overly sweet cherry drink that may once have made the brief acquaintance of some tequila.\n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas Verde and he got the Fajitas de Casa. To their credit, both were so generously portioned that we ended up unable to finish. The chicken in the enchiladas was tasty, but the sauce was bland, especially when I spread the allotment of sour cream over them before realizing it was far too much (and I rarely admit such a situation exists). He enjoyed the mix of proteins in the fajitas but I tried one of the shrimp and found it unpleasant, so the seasoning is for some but not all palettes. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it was also unremarkable.\n\nThe service did meet the standard I had originally expected, with both servers that came to our table being prompt and friendly.\n\nI really did want to be able to write a glowing review of 1900 Mexican, but as it turned out, I won't claim to never be returning, but next time I plan on dropping decent money on Mexican, I am likely to try somewhere else."
0,"This place is a dump. The parking is atrocious and is the main reason why I will never attend a Cubs Spring Training game in Mesa. It took 45 minutes from Center Street and McKellips to park our car. As you are driving about 1 mile an hour or less for 45 minutes. The parking was next to a residential area that had a throng of people selling parking and two lines of cars slowly inching forward with no idea where the end was and no signage to give the paying fan a clue as to what was going on. \n\nI heard this banging on my car which I thought was some gang banger or some overzealous resident trying to sell parking. It turned out to be a parking attendant that had the balls to bang on my Mercedes. This is not a fawking rental car and do you think I was trying to get away without paying $5 bucks for parking? First of all get in the proper position where you can make eye contact with the driver and maybe you can jog and get the driver's attention before you go banging on someone's car. Remember, I am driving at less than one mile per hour.\n\nI think you get the point, I rather spend my money at a restaurant in Scottsdale or Phoenix instead of wasting any of my money at Hohokam Park."
2,"I like this hotel but I don't love it as my stay was nice but I don't think I'd stay here again. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this Trump hotel, it just doesn't feel like it should be in Las Vegas.\n\nThe location is a couple of blocks off the Strip which can be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you want from your stay in Vegas. Its easy to drive elsewhere if you have a car, and a cab ride will cost $15-20 to the farthest reaches of the strip like the Mandalay Bay, and much less for hotels that are closer. \n\nFor those with a car this hotel has valet only, although it is free (included in the resort fee). The valet staff was hard-working and was always friendly and professional on both drop-off and pickup.\n\nThis is also a non-smoking resort, although there were a few people smoking in the pool area (wtf). \n\nThe pool was OK but nothing to write home about. Lounge chairs were plentiful and comfortable, but the pool only went 4ft. deep, kinda lame for someone well over 6ft. tall. There were also two hot tubs, one on either side of the pool, but they close at 6pm (another wtf). The final wtf is for them playing loud, annoying, radio music over speakers that are placed so far apart that it sounds like you are listening to the same song twice, only one of them is playing a half second after the other. For me pools are for relaxing, not for partying, but I could see others differing form my opinion.\n\nThere is only one restaurant in this hotel and I didn't have a chance to try it. The menu looked like standard American hotel cuisine (boring) so I ventured out to other hotels and also away from the Strip to satisfy my culinary urges. \n\nThe lounge next to the restaurant is only open until Midnight on Sundays. Not sure about other days.\n\nFinally, the rooms were very good but with a few downsides. I stayed in the basic room (forget the actual name of the suite but it was the lowest priced room). It was indeed huge and well appointed with a well-sized water closet (walk-in shower), separated toilet closet, dual-vanity sink, and large jacuzzi tub. Everything in the bathroom was great except the shower head had some crust on it and could have used a second shower head, or just a better shower head that had a bigger coverage area (again, I'm a large human and so I prefer a shower that covers more than a few square inches of my body at a time).\n\nThe bed was comfortable but not super comfortable (could have been softer). It creaked a bit as I imagine thousands of people have already had sex in it, with thousands more to do so in the future (hey, its Las Vegas). There were also a few chips on the wood bed frame and the mattress was a few inches too short for the frame. The pillows were super soft and collapsed just how I like. The sheets were also very soft.\n\nThe AC worked fine but there was a large paint chip on the exhaust grill. \n\nThe view of the strip was great, but be warned, you can still hear car traffic and police/ ambulance sirens form the street, even way up on the 59th floor. The windows were double pained but were not at all completely sound-proof like they should have or could have been. Its obvious that they cut corners when designing and/ or building this tower,\n\nAdditionally, some airplanes taking off from the McCarren turn and fly directly overhead Trump which may or may not bother you.\n\nRoom entrances are side by side sharing a common entrance, so its like having two doors to your room. This is a nice touch and means you can't hear any noise from the elevator or hallways. However, the doors are very heavy and SLAM shut super loud, which can be annoying. \n\nWi-fi is included in the resort fee. There are no safes in the room. The mini kitchen is nice too with a mini fridge that is empty and not stocked with overpriced hotel crap.\n\nMy final analyses is that this hotel is more suited to a regular city like New York or Chicago and that I would prefer to stay somewhere else next time I am in Las Vegas. The hotel is nice but is in no way perfect and lacks the dining variety of a Belaggio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, etc. \n\nOh ya, and there is no casino at this hotel."
0,"I actually had to see how the laundry turned out before writing this review... more on that later.\n\nWe had eaten here years previously, when it was awesome and known as the \""Ah-So Steakhouse\"" and also a few times under the Hyakumi name.  Honestly, the quality has continuously deteriorated over the years, but it has always been 'pretty good' and they have a niche.  They are the only teppanyaki type place (I know of) that has private tables where you can have a nice dinner, prepared teppan style, and not have to sit with a bunch of sake swilling yokels from Tennessee.\n\nAnyhow, we decided to give it another shot on this trip to Vegas, and that was an unfortunate decision.  \n\nFirst the food-- It was again \""decent\"".  But it was strange.  Our starters of Miso Soup and the crab salad with cucumbers were excellent and the same as we have had before.  The chef then arrived and in a matter of 5 minutes cooked EVERYTHING else.  The \""appetizer\"" shrimp were cooked at the same time as our lobster entree.  The three shrimp each were not cut into little pieces like usual, but instead just lopped onto our plates.  My dad tried his and said LOUDLY (since its my Dad) \""these are really rubbery\"" to which the chef smiled.  We each ate our three shrimp but they were rubbery and not very good.  The chef again asked \""how are the shrimp?\""  My Dad said \""rubbery\"" and he must have thought that was a compliment because he just smiled.\n\nThe lobster, steak and a mix of mushrooms, zucchini and onions very quickly followed and poof, he was gone.\n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at the teppan private table, but I had barely sat down when the hostess asked if we would mind moving to one of the 'group' tables.  We refused since we prefer the privacy, had asked for it and been seated there.  We theorized that because of this, they bumped the other reservation ahead an hour and rushed us out.\n\nIt seemed like whole courses were skipped, we saw others getting sprouts and we never did.  Our dessert were these strange balls on the end of toothpicks instead of the standard ice cream.\n\nAND, I save the worst for last.  The chefs always must entertain, and that is fine.  Even if its a Dad and a son and we've been there done that 100 times, I guess the old onion volcano thing never gets old.  Except this time, he did the volcano (which involves pouring some kind of oil inside stacked onion slices and lighting it) and his onion stack was unstable.  It collapsed and a bunch of hot grease came flying right at me.  Some hit my bare arm and stung, but no major burns.  Most of it just made grease drops on my nice polo shirt.  The chef seemed nonplussed and asked if I was OK.  I made a couple of comments about the grease stains on my shirt.  No response.  So at the end of the meal we mentioned it to the hostess who brought out the manager.  This gal could have done a lot of things, but did none of them.  She didn't offer anything except to bring in a security guard so we could file a report with risk management.  I don't even know what that means!!  They were worried about being sued maybe?  In any case, a classy place at least discounts the $59 each we paid to cover the dry cleaning for the shirt... it had many many visible grease droplets on it.  Her response was UNBELIEVABLE... and clinches that after many visits to this place, we will never return."
4,Super great place. Food was good friendly people. We ordered take out and while you waited they gave his ice tea. They alway make you feel welcome when you come in. Place is very clean. You have to come and eat here.
1,"Had the godfather. Crisp bread but salami is inexpensive type. Hubby had firemen. Bread and bacon crisp, hamburger patty premade/prebought. Would have been better with fresh patty. Curly fries are good. Great and fast service."
2,"Went to Ri Ra on the 3rd day they were open, during the soft opening.  There wasn't  a live band, so I can't say how it is when one is playing.  I like the layout of the place - the whole left side is one long bar and the whole right side is seating and booths.  Even though there was no band, it was pretty noisy and pub-like.\n\nThe food was just ok.  The boyfriend got the shepherd's pie and it was ok.  I tried the Kilbeggan Salmon and it was pretty delicious.  Appetizers were crab cakes and onion rings.  The crab cakes themselves were just alright, but the sauce that they put on them was awesome!  I really liked the onion rings - the were the tiny, thin cut onions and were super tasty.\n\nService was slow, but they were pretty busy and had only been open a couple of days, so I'll forgive it.  Our waiter (can't remember his name, but he was Irish) was super nice and chatty.  I'll definitely try this place again."
1,"I have been going to Chompies for years and normally I would give it a better rating.. When our out-of-town guests wanted to go out for breakfast we immediately thought of Chompies. I knew it would be busy on a Sunday morning but I expected they know how to handle a crowd. There was quite a few people waiting for tables but when we registered our party of 5 we were told it would be about a 10 minute wait. We were seated 35 minutes later. While our server was nice and helpful it took another 30 minutes to finally get our orders in and get served our food. We immediate asked for a plain, unheated bagel for a starving and fidgeting toddler and had to ask about it twice before it finally arrived...toasted.  Our food, when it finally did arrive, was pretty good but not up to what I have come to expect from Chompies. I think they might just have been having a bad day but I will never go there on a weekend morning again and I don't recommend you do either."
1,"The old adage of \""you get what you pay for\"" can be relied on more often than not. Sometime it's worth paying extra for a nice meal in a nice restaurant, and on some level, I can understand why girls spend hundreds of pounds on handbags and shoes, and footballers spend hundreds of thousands on crass automobiles.\n\nI will never, ever, ever, understand though, why I shouldn't get change from \u00a315 for 3 bits of fudge.\n\n3 measly, stinking pieces. For \u00a315. They're not even all that great either. They do taste pretty good for the first couple of bites, but the flavours rarely cover over the fact that you're basically munching on a big, costly lump of sugar, and you'll feel sick long before the end of the first slab.\n\nThere's no flavours on offer here that you won't find done to tastier effect in a tub of Ben & Jerry's, and if you're desperate for a fudge hit then take a trip to Thorntons. Don't let the grinning thieves behind the counter fool you with their \""banter\"", you are a sick, old, wildebeest, they are a hungry, cackling band of hyenas.\n\nBack when Britain was truly great, these people hung from the gallows. Sadly the politically correct pen-pushers no longer let us take the law into our own hands on these shores, but at least do your bit by voting with your feet."
2,Bey good food. The only thing is that it's a little bit pricey for what your getting.
0,"If I had more time to find the right apartment, it wouldn't be at Madera.  \n\nThe property is over 13 years old and, although the staff in the leasing office are nice, helpful and professional, the apartment I waited a week to get into was/is dirty (I'm still cleaning), smells like the smoker who lived there before me, and it has roaches!  I've killed and swept up dozens of them in the two days I've lived here.  The A/C units work but are really noisy.  If I were the property manager, I would be more fastidious with the condition of the apartments I lease.  Also, I wonder where the $300 \""cleaning fees\"" I and other new residents have to fork over are being spent.  Oh yeah, we are in Las Vegas... \n\nThe grounds look nice, for the most part, with trees and bushes all around with grassy areas too.  There are two pools and the fitness center is adequate.  Aside from the granite counters in the apartment's kitchen which are nice, my apartment looks outdated and in need of a revival, and deep cleaning.  \n\nSigned,\n\nStill Searching..."
4,"Wait, you passed it.  Turn around. OK, now where to park? Valet or the garage underneath the restaurant? Now that I've found a space where are the signs to get upstairs to the restaurant. \n\nOnce you get through finding the place, parking, going upstairs all the work will be worth it. \n\nThe sweet potato fries aren't fried, they taste better than the alternative and they're the reason I'm going to keep coming back. I started with the sweet potato avocado salad that had the perfect texture. The agave nectar soda is guilt free and so good. \n\nThe best thing is, even though I'm vegan, my friends who eat there love the burgers and the fact that everyone can get the best of both worlds. It's not just True Food Kitchen anymore."
3,"P. Croissants keeps it fairly simple, so I am going to do the same with my review:\n\nCroissants - AMAZING. Like everyone says, get their early. I really loved the cherry cheese, strawberry, and peanut butter varieties. \n\nSandwiches - Meh. Maybe my hopes were too high. They took forever to make and were just so-so.\n\nCoffee and Espresso drinks - BOO. Overpriced and not very good. Go somewhere else for your java."
1,Disappointing. Walked in around 2pm for a late lunch and drinks on a Saturday. No one was working the bar. The food was ok. Not great. I thought it was expensive too compared to other Mexican places in the area. And an extra $1.50 for using a credit card? Probably won't come back. And never got my drink.
0,"My husband & I have gone here many times. Fun atmosphere. Very good pizza. The staff are snobs. Of all the uptown/dowtown hipster places in the U.S. I've been to eat, I had never dined at a restaurant that fuels itself from bullying the patrons. Consistently. Mean does not = cool. Don't ask for an extra glass of water, and do what the waiter/hostess/manager tells you and you will do just fine. We finally got fed up with the treatment. We will never go back."
4,"I've been to The Vig a handful of times... for at least 4 lunches, a few times for just drinks / happy hour, and at least 2 dinners.  I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!\n\nI've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)\n\nI'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their \""Miso Hungry Salmon.\""  \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!\n\nIf this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!"
2,"Pros: \n-open 24hrs\n-organized waiting list\n-clean for a pho place\n-quick, but crap service(typical of viet places)\n-the pho helped my hangover\n\n\nCons:\n-crap service\n-meh pho\n-8 bucks for pho\n-smaller portions than other pho joints I've been to\n\nOverall, it's a pretty mediocre place. If you're in Vegas and have a pho craving, it will do. But just don't expect it to do that much."
3,"Deep fried goodness from the snack bar in the back of Mermaids!\n\nI don't go here to gamble or for the drinks. I go for the unhealthy snacks like the deep fried twinkies or oreos, or even the hot dogs. \n\nThe place isn't the newest or the nicest and in fact, this time around, some of the clientele seemed seedy but I wasn't there to make friends - I was there to eat! \n\nI didn't have one but the have hot dogs for a buck. Not too bad if you need something in your gut other than the booze you can get cheap at the bar or anywhere on Fremont Street."
2,"Well, I must say I was quite impressed with this place. It almost got a four star rating from me, and that's VERY rare. As always, I checked up on Yelp and also the Maricopa County health inspections site to make sure this place wasn't a liability waiting to happen to my stomach. Seemed quite legit from what I read, so I joined in with group of workmates for lunch yesterday. The parking spots out the front are absolutely ridiculous and appear impossible to park a car in - if you had a regular sedan in one of the spaces, its butt would literally be on the sidewalk and about a half yard from the kerb. Just plain weird. So we parked around the corner in front of a minimart and walked back. Interior is nice and clean, I was sort of expecting it to be more on the dingy side. It's one of those place-order-at-counter-and-they-bring-it-to-your-table places. Fairly limited menu, but then again it's a cheesesteak joint, not Claim Jumper.\n\nI ordered the Coronado minus the peppers. Plenty of the items appear to have jalapenos or habaneros, and once upon a time that'd have been just fine with me, but I've softened over the years. I got a side of fries and a drink. The food took a while to be made; not too long, maybe about 15 mins? They certainly didn't seem to be goofing off in the kitchen though. Out came the food and I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not one of these wankers who walk in already predisposed against a place, ready to start judging how sh1t is done in \""Philly\"" or \""Chicago\"" and who wind up missing the point completely (see my highly-rated review of the now-closed Frank-N-Steins in Surprise for more rage on this subject *8-), I was simply there to have a good meal. And I sure got one. The food was delicious.. bread was soft and fresh, meat was tender as hell and the chilli mayo was pretty much all world. I haven't had a sandwich that tasty in.. well, in about a week, actually, since I had an All-American Grinder at Uncle Sams. Shoestring fries were pretty good too. Uncle Sams' are better. I'm not really a \""crisp fries\"" guy, but.. these were good.\n\nThe only thing bringing my rating down to the usual average is the price. My whole sandwich was $9.75 plus tax. And an additional $2.50 for the fries and drink. That's just a little too expensive for lunch. I've had burritos as big as my forearm packing just as much flavour for $5.95, and while I get the whole \""it's super delightful, ultra-quality, hand-chopped ribeye\"" thing, ten bucks for a mid-sized hoagie regardless of whether or not it contains sauteed unicorn nuts is too steep to make me want to return as frequently as I otherwise would. Weird how a half is $8 and a whole is a buck senny five more. Seems almost like movie popcorn pricing to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this was probably the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten and everyone I was with agreed, and it's a surprisingly neat little establishment where you might actually want take out-of-town tie-wearers for lunch, but it's just a tad on the pricey side IMO."
2,3/5/11\nTried the apple fritter and bear claw and 4 donut holes for $3...not sure if that was considered a good deal...10 cents per donut hole so that made each donut $1.30 considering i don't usually do donuts but with all the reviews we tried it! they were good...don't really have anything to compare them to as we don't really eat many donuts...\n\nnext time we'll have to come in the morning and see if there's a difference? We had no idea some of them were vegan until after we left! no signage on any of them...
3,"Ate here for lunch last weekend for the first time in over 8 years. I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere! \n\nThe lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri. \n\nI also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \""salad\"" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.\n\nYou can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy. \n\nI was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!"
4,We love this place the food is awesome and always good we eat here at least dr once a week and would recommend it to anyone.
3,"Pros: Email notifications to offer standby room upgrades. Corner suites are gorgeous. The bathrooms are absolutely wonderful. Heated toilet seats! Lights, tv, and curtains all controlled through your tv or remote. For being the baseline suite it was pretty nice. \n\nCons: The roughest towels i've ever used. My God, they were rough. It was like using corrugated cardboard. Shampoo and body wash were a total fail as well. I'd describe it as faux soap."
4,"The service here was great!  The food was even better, though.  It is comfort food, but done so well!  The sage fried chicken tastes like you're biting in to Thanksgiving.  The side of salmon that my friend ordered with her salad was huge and delicious.  It was better prepared than what she had at Craft Restaurant the next day, and it was a fraction of the price.  These people are clear about what they want to deliver and then do it with excellence.  Well done!"
0,"Well, after reading all the great reviews and hearing a lot about this place, I was so excited to eat here for lunch yesterday! I got chili cheese fries, and a plain ole' hotdog. My daughter got an order of the chicken nuggets. I wasn't really impressed by any of the food I had ordered. I'm really picky about my hotdogs and I was kind of grossed out by how thick they were. I'm used to the dodger dog styled ones, not Chicago style. That turned me off for the rest of my meal. My bun was really soggy and my hot dog kept falling out of it and that just pissed me off. The chili fries were also really runny. Not sure if they make their own chili but it was defiantly too runny for my liking. And last but not least, my daughters chicken nuggets tasted like a bucket of salt was dumped all over them. And don't get me wrong, I put salt on everything, I LOVE salt, but even that amount of salt was too much for me! I just really wasn't impressed by this place. Ill be sticking to wienershnitzle"
0,Hygienist said that it would cost an extra $90 to clean my teeth. I left and went back to my old dentists' office at Family Dentistry (next to Fry's) and they performed the cleaning with no extra charge. The hygienist was extra pushy and refused to do the standard cleaning. \n\nAlso I was having extreme pain in my gum and the dentist could not determine what was wrong; dentist wrote me a referral to go to an oral surgeion. Again I went to Family Dentistry and they found a laceration in my gum and prescribed me the appropriate medication - dentist there said there was no need to go to an oral surgeon.\n\nI had high hopes for this dental office but they fell WAY short of expectations. I DO NOT recommend this place.
4,I'd never been here before but it was a great experience.  We saw Avenue Q in the Hormel Theatre.  It's very small and intimate - great place to see a show.  We had excellent seats but I suspect just about every seat is a good one.  Looking forward to coming back!
3,"Heard some good things about the food and decided to stop by after church to grab some takeout.  Service was very good!  I was immediately greeted by a server and was offered a menu as well as a seat to place my order.\n\nI ordered a 1/2lb of lechon belly, 4 pieces of the bbq chicken skin and adobo kangkong for about $20.  While I was waiting, friendly staff offered me a glass of water.  Food was ready within 15 minutes.\n\nOverall, the food was very tasty but only thing was I wished the skin on the lechon and bbq chicken skin was crispier.  In all fairness it could've gotten soggy while driving home and doing a 10 minute errand but don't know for sure.  Other than that, flavor profile on everything was good and will definitely try again!"
2,"As a tourist, it was mentioned to me that I needed to have breakfast here before I left. So that is precisely what I did. My two sisters and I strolled in on a Tuesday morning around 11. The main dining room was full, but the room next door was empty and we sat ourselves.\n\nSo service is wishy-washy, but it's a diner, so what do you expect? Our drinks were brought out in a timely manner, as were our meals, so I cannot complain.\n\nWe each ordered hot cakes, strawberry, blueberry, and banana chocolate chip. We also ordered sausage, bacon, and potatoes. Everything was decent! The portions of hot cakes was really big! Since everyone was talking it up, I was a little underwhelmed, but I did leave satisfied."
3,"After going several years without a Sam's Club membership, I recently snatched up a deal on groupon for a membership.  \n\nI didn't renew my membership when it lapsed because we figured that membership to Costco was plenty and that we wouldn't use both.  After getting the membership, I remembered why I liked Sam's in the past.  They carry completely different items than Costco.  There are several items that I really love that Costco doesn't carry.\n\nOne of the great things about Sam's is that you can add a non-family member onto your membership and split the cost of membership!  Does anyone know if Costco does this?  \n\nWe've always been helped by friendly employees."
3,"Cool, pseudo-underground bar in Madison. Very unique decor, and mysterious lighting. They usually have a DJ on busy nights.\n\nFood is good- good asian-ish selection of snacks. Three cup chicken/tofu is solid, along with their pizza selections.\n\nThey have a pretty solid drink menu; good liquor selection and interesting beers on tap.\n\nIf they started accepting credit cards, this place would blow up. Maybe that's intentional; don't think it could handle much more people."
2,Went here with the fiance because its in our neighborhood and wanted to go somewhere other than Zipps.\n\nSeat yourself deal which is fine. All the tables in the place had Blue Moon condiment holders but no Blue Moon. .LAME. Fiance liked that there was PBR and selections from our local favorite Four peaks so I settled for a Shock Top.\n\nService was decent and I imagine wouldve been beter had there not been an NFL playoff game on.\n\nFood was great. The batter they use for onion rings is freaking delicious. Wings were yummy and my burger was huge! The jalapeno coins and mozzarella sticls were also good. \n\nI'd definitely come back more often if they had Blue Moon on tap!
1,"I have been twice now.  Both times I went in looking for good wings.  Both times I walked out disappointed. \n\nI had the boneless both times.  The chicken is lost in the heavy breading.  Very dry. \n\nI do like their options for various flavors.  The Mango Habanero is excellent.  Also like that they offer a dry season. \n\nBut if I am looking for good wings or boneless in this case, there are some other places I will look first. \n\nGreat for football viewing.  Also they offer UFC fights.  Also nice selections of beer."
1,"This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken. \n\nThe atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff.\n\nI hope to return soon and update my review ( :"
4,"The carrot raisin muffins alone are deserving of the 5 stars.  This trip the hubby had the chicken pot pie and I had the Quiche Lorraine.  Pot pie was flaky and comforting.  Quiche was fluffy and not dense, just the way I like it.  The food is always good here.  I also had an iced coffee and it was perfect.  Service is 10x better here than the Mimi's Cafe on Sahara.  I took my cousin to the Mimi's on Sahara about a month ago and the waiter acted like he had never heard of an \""iced coffee\"".  My cousin had to literally tell him to give her a coffee with ice."
1,I don't know if its the time I'm going but the attitudes are unbelievable. I cannot express how rude Tasha was to me. Which is fine because frankly i didn't need it anyways. Needless to say i will not go back .
2,"Some people are going to view this as a one star hotel and others are going to view it as a five star... it's all about what you are looking for.\n\n1 star... if you are looking for any semblance of the typical Las Vegas experience.\n\n5 star... if you don't want to be anywhere near the action, are looking for a relaxed location and spot, and are probably there with your family.\n\nNormally I would rate something for being what it is, but the problem in this case is false advertising that gets people here when it's not exactly what they are looking for (at least in our case).\n\nFor starters, \""on the Las Vegas Strip\"" in the name of the hotel itself is pretty misleading.  This is a LOOSE definition of the word strip because it's about as far as you can get from the main strip and still be on the strip.  I'd say it was 5 miles to the Venetian / Bellagio etc area.   Sure, we should have done our due diligence and researched this, but my sister had seen one of the locations which was closer to the center of the strip and assumed it was that one when she booked it, not knowing there are 5 different Hilton properties in and around the strip.\n\nThey told her she was getting a very special discounted rate for attending a timeshare presentation, but upon checking the advertised rates, it was about the same. Also, the rates weren't any cheaper than the rest of the strip for that weekend, so it's not like we were getting a discount for being far from the action either.\n\nThis really got me.. you have to PAY for parking every day.. and the parking lot is not exactly attached to the hotel. The first 4-5 levels are reserved for valet and are totally empty, so it's a bit annoying having to circle around and around empty spaces to get to ones you can park in.  One of the things about Vegas is free parking everywhere, but such is not the case here.\n\nNo Casino / Smoke, etc.. points plus for this.\n\nGym - Okay, normally people in Vegas don't exactly make it to the gym. But the types of people that stay somewhere like this are the types that are going to go to  the gym... so there should be more than 4 elliptical machines.  Waiting in line for an hour was not ideal. The gym is WAY too small for the capacity.\n\nThe walls are pretty thin and we could hear whatever the people next door were watching on TV at all hours.\n\nWe called down for more blankets, more toiletries and a toothbrush, and had a blanket thrown in our room with no other stuff.  Literally.. they knocked on the door and we were in bed and getting up to go answer it when we heard the door fly open, the blanket be thrown in, and the door slammed shut. Jeez.\n\nAll in all, this hotel is adequate.  I get if people want to be away from the strip, but there's not need to be SO far from it that you don't even feel like you are in Vegas. The gym is not great, but it does have a few good machines with TVS.  The rooms are clean and spacious and as advertised, albeit with thin walls.\n\nSo I'd say.. make sure you know what you are looking for, and that this is it. We definitely were disappointed, but it was partly our fault for not doing our due diligence beforehand."
3,"Where have i been? Apparently not on that side of town. My friend and i have been looking for a place that had fried fish here and finally have found it. And its not too far from my home thats even better. NOW what caught my eye was the all you can eat fish and shrimp, which is only on friday and saturday. Come hungry, you wont leave disappointed. The variety of fish is also appealing, catfish, haddock, cod wow and the owner gave us samples of the  onion rings!!\n Everything hand dipped and fried to order, those onion rings were the most perfect golden delicious ones i have had.\nGluten free sweet,  the aroma itself had me sold but the food backed it up and i can say Lazy Joes have a fan in me and he will see me again and again. Seeing the menu and the weekly specials that they have all very affordable..OH and the hush puppies, shut up are the bomb.I'll be back fo sure."
4,"It's so nice to have a healthy, yet quick alternative to fast food. I love to get a full salad and sandwich to have food for the whole day. I haven't really had anything that I didn't like here. I think that when you start looking at all of the ingredients one might start to think what is that or do I like that? I try to just go with whatever toppings are included (barring any allergies) because I have faith that they know what they are doing! I like to introduce myself to new foods that I'm not familiar with because I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but am trying to be more conscious of eating healthy. I'm so happy to have discovered the wonderful treat to your body that is D'lish!"
4,"Beautiful place. the inside was stunning! Didn't eat here just had some drinks, the tequila selection is nice and the staff is great. Definitely will come back to eat!"
2,"Wait...this place was voted \""Best of?\"" (It even says it on the outside of their building.) This place was decent.  However, it in no way can compete with Bagel Cafe.\n\nA friend of ours recommended this place, after he had discovered their bakery cookies.  We decided to get breakfast.\n\nI had 2 eggs scrambled with bacon, onion and cream cheese.  It was very good.  The price was perfect.  \n\nHowever, my husband had a bagel sandwich, and we were a bit disappointed.  For a place that prides themselves on being a NY deli, their bagels are pretty bad. Sorry. They're small and flavorless- my husband described it as being \""just like those 'Lender's' bagels in the freezer section.\""\n\nTheir bakery treats are very good though.  Macaroons and Chocolate Susans are awesome.  I wasn't a fan of the Mandel Bread.  The bread itself was great, but I don't like chocolate chips AND raisins in it.\n\nFor the price, this place is pretty decent.  Come here for the bakery, or some brunch, but dont come to have a great bagel."
2,"The manager and the man at the pizza counter are a generous two stars and the pizza is almost four stars. \n\nI walked up to the pizza counter, curious about the pizza. I asked if this was Neapolitan Pizza and the guy seemed annoyed I was asking him a question. He said it was a hybrid between New York pizza and Neapolitan. I then asked him why the pizzas on the counter looked different than the one being made and he said because they are different pizzas. Obviously I knew the pizzas were different because of the different toppings, but I was basically getting at the pizzas have been out for too long that they look completely different from the one being freshly made. I then asked to speak with the manager to tell him about his employee who clearly was annoyed answering questions. He seemed to hear me but at the same time did not offer me a discount or anything to make up for the disappointing first impression. I should have left after this but I still ordered a slice of pizza. I ordered the spinach/ricotta/ mushroom pizza and it was just rich enough without being sickeningly rich. The crust had a sour flavor which is completely different from a New York pizza or Neapolitan. I appreciated them trying to be different but it was a little to sour for my taste. The crust was chewy, all the ingredients paired nicely together, and the sweetness of the ricotta helped balance out the sourness of the crust. I must say the pizza was pretty delicious, but the price is a little steep at almost $7 a slice."
3,"I like red curry, normally I go for veggie because I don't trust the quality of the meat in most Thai restaurants (not usually high-end). Because of the higher-end atmosphere and higher prices (not by much though), I tried the beef. Best decision of my life. Succulent. Also, wonderful service, extremely professional and on the ball. \nMy boyfriend didn't like his food as much, only due to personal taste, as it wasn't a flavor he enjoyed.  But go red curry go."
0,"It may have been nice when new but its far from it now. If your a smoker this is the place for you. I felt like Id smoked a pack between parking my car and checking in at the front desk. Don't arrive early because they up charge you to check in an hour early.($22) Then of course you need to also pay for the resort fee, another $22. Even if you don't use any of the so called resort. Half the shops are closed or close to it, even one of the Starbucks of the lobby. Dirty, tired the place is past its prime. Even for free I would never step foot inside again. Dump is the 4 letter word that best describes this place."
0,"I have visited hazelwoods over ten times. I like the food and the set up of the bar in general. I want to like this bar and have given it a fair chance. Despite this I will not be returning. The day time wait staff has been unfriendly and has not made any attempt to engage me as a customer. With direct competition across the street I expected more of an effort to keep potential repeat business. I have repeatedly not been greeted in a friendly manner, been engaged as a customer, or thanked for my business in any way. I work in the service industry and understand and value of taking care of your regulars. I will not be returning to this restaurant with other options in the immediate vicinity."
3,"Fettuccine al Granchio, Astice e Gamberi: Homemade fettuccine with crab, lobster, and shrimp with a touch of tomato sauce, $38\n-Wow, this was excellent. Fresh seafood, fresh tasty sauce, fresh pasta. Pricey, but absolutely delicious.\n\nTiramisu, $12\n-They serve a small portion in this cone-shaped glass and it was some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Perfectly soaked lady fingers, not too sweet, light and airy mascarpone and Zabaglione. Would have liked more tiramisu, but the quality is excellent!\n-My mom got the Chocolate Mousse and that was excellent as well.\n\nDecor is very nice and overlooks the Venetian \""canal.\"" Romantic setting, with fiddlers playing in the background. You can ask them to play any tune you want (for a tip, of course); they even know the Chinese butterfly concerto! Prices are steep, but what do you expect from Vegas? Quality is excellent."
2,"Rock Bottom seems to be hit, or miss. They have a pretty decent menu with a variety of items. Their happy hours is sort of ho-hum for me. There's not really a lot of good deals to be had, but beers are relatively well priced even when not on happy hour.\n\nI had gotten two vouchers from restaurant.com and used those on two separate occasions. The first time I got the prime rib, and though I was excited to order it, I wasn't excited to finish it. It tasted as thought it had been cooked too long and there was very little flavor or moisture remaining in the meat.\n\nHowever, still having another coupon I returned a second time. The second experience I ordered a steak. My wife ordered on also. I ordered mine the house default which is a little bit between medium and medium rare and it was delicious. Well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered hers more well done and it came out very well done. The flavor was not great, even for her. I realize that it goes without saying that it is usually best to order what the kitchen is good at doing, but be cautious in ordering things well done or you might get it really well done. We had chips which are rather cheap and they come with a sufficient serving size and decent salsa. If you like hefeweizens they have a great wit-bier that tastes similar to blue-moon with a greater serving of cloves. It tastes good and I was a fan."
0,"Okay, so I just went to Vegas for the first time for my 21st birthday. Basically, I LOVE VEGAS! The clubs we went to were absolutely amazing...\n\nEXCEPT Prive!\n\nSo let me just say, all the girls that work there were BITCHES! We ordered about 5 drinks and we wanted to pay with cash and card. The bartender said, \""Well, we can't do that!\"" Hella snobby and rude. We were confused why she couldn't perform such an easy task... which EVERYWHERE else can! We were asking her why and she was just giving us attitude like \""WE JUST CAN'T.\"" So we were sitting there trying to gather money together to pay for our drinks and she got impatient and randomly just picked up our drinks and slammed them to the side and said \""I can't deal with this! Either you pay, or you don't get your drinks!\"" And we were so shocked... that's what we were trying to do, was PAY. DUH. It's not like we're just gonna walk away. I swear she was a dumb bitch. Sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but she was a total BUZZ KILL. And to kill a buzz in Vegas is a pretty huge accomplishment. So I guess the bitch gets one star for that... NOT. Anyways, my friend ends up putting in $40 for only his drink, because we all didn't have cash on us. (By the way, the drinks were ridicuously over priced!) Throughout this whole lame discussion with this bartender my friends and I were being totally calm and respectful. We were just shocked that she was really giving us this huge, not needed attitude towards us.\n\nSo, after the 30min buzz kill... we started dancing. The music was far to loud... like vibrations everywhere. My ears were killing me! I like loud music, but DAMN. Also, all the other workers there were helpless. They just sat there on bumb on logs. Seriously, worst club experience of my life! Never going there again. Sad that is, it's the club in the resort I stayed at (Planet Hollywood). The resort is LEGIT... minus club Prive.\n\nSo, if you go there (which I obviously don't recommend), be prepared to pay money to get in, deal with horrible customer service, and waaaaay to loud of music.\n\n\nThe end :)"
3,"Oysters.  That's all there is to it, 15 deep fried oysters.  That is all I want, that is all I order.\n\nOf all the P* Fish and Chips, this breading is the thinnest... I was thinking it was all pre-fabbed, but now reading Jared A's review, perhaps the secret is hand breading!"
1,"Their squid ink risotto is my favorite.  When they first opened, their food wasn't bad at all.  My last experience at Canaletto was not really good.  I ordered a soup, and I really think the canned soup could be much better than that. There are many other great restaurants in Venetian, no reason to dine again @Canaletto."
0,"I usually never write reviews on yelp, but I feel the need to in this situation because it is unbelievable how awful this place has become. First, let me clarify that I love my doctor, Dr. Bui. He is the ONLY reason why I still continue to go to this office. However, I try to avoid calling or making appointments as much as possible. I have been going to this office for over 15 years, but for the past year or so everything besides Dr. Bui is absolutely horrible. Words cannot describe how awful the front desk and office is. Without fail, every time I call the office for a need, the person on the other line is unbelievably rude. In addition, there is hardly a time when I get put on hold for less than 30 minuets, because no one knows what they're doing because. The reason I say that they don't know what they're doing is because the last time I called, while on hold, I had to tell them 3 separate times what the reason for my call was. They kept putting me back on hold and forgetting to transfer me then asking me why I was on hold again. Also, if I suddenly become sick and call to make an appointment to see a doctor as soon as possible, who ever answers the phone is almost excited and enjoys telling me that Dr. Bui is completely booked for appointments for at least a week in advanced. So pretty much I have to plan when I'm sick. The worst part is I know that when I speak to \""Martha\"" I need to prepare to be spoken to in the rudest, most unprofessional manner ever.  Finally, expect to wait for at least at least 20 minuets, after  your scheduled appointment.  :)"
1,"This 5th generation cattleman from Missouri finds himself not impressed with Lawry's The Prime Rib and their lunch offerings. Let's start from the top and work through the experience. \n\nParking: Ample for lunch, but for a 600 seat restaurant it would be a little tight during prime time hours. \n\nDecor. Their website claims an Art Deco appearance, but having spent a lot of time brushing up on Kansas City's Art Deco architecture which led me into a more expansive study or two, I'm not an \""expert\"" on Art Deco style but I'm not an amateur either. Count me among the people who are not impressed with this location's styling. It was ho-hum, and quite frankly I've seen and experienced better. \n\nService: Slow and not impressive. I ordered the Tuesday lunch special. I never received my chili that I ordered that was part of the special. Another person at our table ordered extra food at the end of our meal to take back to the office and it took an awful long time for it to arrive. Also I was not offered a refill on my iced tea either. That's something I shouldn't have to ask for, it simply needs to be taken care of, especially at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nFood: I liked the 4 bread choices. But quite frankly I was not impressed with their sides which lacked adequate seasonings and spices. And then there's the problem with the meat and where a Cardinal Sin was committed. I watched as it was carved in front of me. The appearance was good, I brought it back to the table looking forward to enjoying it. 3 bites in and I'm like this is so disappointing. It wasn't tender, and it lacked good flavor. For a minute I was wondering if they had run out of quality meat and had substituted Sysco's cheapest product line instead. I needed to eat so I took a few more bites as to not offend the people I was with, but it was extremely disappointing. For a place with a name that says THE PRIME RIB on the sign, that has 70 some odd years of providing food service, I was disappointed at the quality of food that ended up on my plate. The horseradish was a pleasant surprise though and the saving grace that allowed me to consume the sandwich and not leave with a growling stomach. \n\nVerdict: Not impressed. At all. I'm thankful I didn't have to foot the bill for this experience, and I'm glad I got to experience a Vegas \""legend\"" but Lawry's won't make my list of places I will have business lunches at, or take out of town guests to if I want to showcase the best of what Las Vegas has to offer. \n\n2 Stars. I'm sorry, but I can't be impressed when one of their signature items, one of the things they claim to do so well was so hard to consume and not enjoyable. I used the term Cardinal Sin...I chose my words carefully. \n\nBarring the unexpected I won't be back."
4,"Start your review...I don't go to the \""salad places\"" too often. Sweet Tomatoes is one of the few healthy food joints that I actually go to and will continue to return. Their food is always fresh and their servers are always polite. I have never had a negative experience at this location and I've even had the manager, and asked if everything was okay.\n\nThe only thing that has changed is a no longer have an area for the add-ons like chicken and other items. It used to be that you could pay a couple dollars more and put check in on your salad but they remove that option it look like. Me being a meat eater, I always look for a protein substance to put on my salad. However even without this I found the food to be good.\n\nI had several different types of salads along with the tuna salad. It always good and I would highly suggest going here. It's a nice alternative to pizza, or burgers."
2,Good food.  Good service.  Bad location.  Bad hoodlums in the strip mall where it is located.
3,"Be sure u go to the right location, Bethany Home & 16th. Next to Dick's Hideaway"
3,Don't be fooled!  This place serves awesome food and drinks!  I'm very picky and was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely will be going back.
3,"This place gets it right with amazing coffee, friendly baristas, and a great atmosphere. \n\nOther places in Pittsburgh may have one of these (or maybe even two!) but, certainly not all three.\n\nA great pit stop while walking around lower Lawrenceville."
2,"A well themed resort with mediocre service.\n\n***ROOM***\nI was happy with our pool-view room in the Casino tower. Our standard room was pretty spacious (500 sq. ft.?) with a few noteworthy amenities: an iHome and a bed as fluffy as clouds. The room could have skipped out on the portrait of some rockstar, who kept freaking me out each time I caught a glimpse of it.\n\nWe booked the place with the intention to recuperate from our weekend at EDC. Instead, I felt like we were part of the Rehab party. We were fine with that too... it kept the party going. Even with our balcony door closed, we could still feel the vibration of the bass from the pool party. :)\n\n***SERVICE***\nBefore even entering our rooms, I had already received subpar service --\nMy hotel package came with a comp bottle of hard A + $40 food and drink credit. While checking in, the receptionist was ready to send me on my merry way with just the room keys, until I had to ask for my vouchers. Though he corrected the mistake, he seemed the least bit apologetic, and even judgmental, like I was freeloading off them... um no! just asking for what I paid! I would not even have to ask if I had received it in the first place!\n\nThe second day, we slept through \""Tidy Up\"" time, so I called Guest Services to replenish our tissues, amenities, and towels stock later that night. Housekeeping came 10 minutes later with towels, and a bag with two sets of amenities, but minus the soap. I never saw the box of tissues either D: I guess I'll be better prepared with my own amenities next time. \n\n***OVERALL*** \nGreat view of the pool and back of the strip, especially at night, but this is the last time I am booking a standard room here on my own free will. I would be open to staying at a HRH Tower Suite on a future visit. From pictures, the Suite looks similar to the ones at Vdara. \n\nNote: Stay away from this resort if you are looking for peace and quiet  in Vegas. :)"
2,Went here with a large group. Service was very good. Food and drink was really good.
4,"Sauce is my absolute fav. I don't think I've had a single thing there that I haven't liked. While they are pretty well known for their pizza which is absolutely delish, I usually tend to eat a little on the healthier side and get either the turkey and feta salad or this other salad that has pears in it (I kind of forget exactly what it is, but I've gotten it a few times). I also like the soup and you can't go wrong with their turkey sandwich either. Oh, and their mac n cheese!!! So delish. Those are pretty good standbys, and it's nice that they give you bread and butter on the side no matter what you order, even if you do get a sandwich which a lot of places tend to skimp on the bread if you ordered bread as a staple of your meal (which is probably better for you anyway, but thanks for the extra bread, Sauce!) It's also nice that it's really close to a lot of stuff, so it's a good lunch spot during the work day. Don't get caught browsing at Urban Outfitters while you wait for your food though or you might get stuck spending 100 bucks in about 5 minutes like I did last time I went. Yikes."
3,"I have been to this location many times in the recent months.  \n\nEach time we have ordered whole pizza. And also had the special which includes wings. \n\nI have been very happy with this style of pizza. And wings have been very good also.  Wings are meaty and have nice cover of sauce without being over powered.\n\nI will say that this style of pizza (in my opinion) is better with only a few toppings.  Once you add too many toppings, it seams to come out a little heavy.  Will stick to the traditional one or two toppings and keep it more of the NY style. \n\nI have only been there in the evening and ordered whole pizza. So I cannot comment on whether it is a good place for one or two slices.  I will say that the pizza that was under the lights at counter did not look very appealing or fresh when we came in in the evening.  I would probably avoid the one/two slice order based on appearance. \n\nBut want a good whole pizza, this is my place!!!"
1,"Malheureusement, pas d'ambiance dans ce resto cor\u00e9en, d\u00e9coration \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer et la nourriture bonne mais j'ai connu mieux. Je ne pense pas y retourner."
1,"While everything is fresh, I am still not impressed.  I prefer the true Mediterranean restaurants, like Spices.  This place is just another trendy spin on Mediterranean food.  Examples:  the tzatziki had chunks of cucumber (weird) and the Greek salad didn't have olives.  Won't be back."
1,"Went here tonight. I bought an ocean blue goblet. It was decent definitely not worth the $36 dollars. Decent place, just extremely pricey."
4,Incredible. One of the best dinners I have ever had. \n\nGreat service and atmosphere. \n\nEverything on the menu is delicious. \n\nThis is a MUST try place.
0,"After being gone for nearly two months, the far to overzealous sign spinner employed by this business IS UNFORTUNATELY BACK at 202 and Chandler and the manager of this place hung up on me when I was discussing the problem again.  I guess I'll have to resort to uploading to youtube the dash-cam videos of this idiot sign spinner repeatedly dropping his sign in the street and the antics and lengths he goes to to get attention for this business which is obviously not successful enough with its existing customer base to stay in business.  Businesses that are successful and packed do so by remembering who the customer is and providing a good product at a fair price, NOT by trying to attract so much attention that they risk causing traffic accidents and repeatedly annoy drivers to the point they call the police!  The traffic accident most likely to occur is one where a driver is trying to turn the corner and is distracted by this idiot's sign or yelling and they get hit T-bone style RIGHT IN THE DRIVERS DOOR!  I knew someone that was T-boned in the drivers side and SHE AND HER 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ARE DEAD!!!!!  If you want to take back our streets from the idiot sign spinners like the one used by this business, DON'T GO THERE!!!  I would never again think of going to this business!"
2,"I have to admit that despite the fact I walk past this place on my way  to the Pleasance Gym on a regular basis, I only recently realised Coffee Corner existed. \""Why I just happen to be a Yelp Scout, let's give this place a try\"" I thought.\n\nI think the name Coffee Corner is slightly misleading. Its technically not right on the corner and whilst they do offer coffee, its emphasis is on selling cheap convenient food to take away. There are a couple of seats by the window but in all likelihood you'll be grabbing and going. The food on offer is of the fast food variety: pizza, burgers as well as wraps. I think the latter is the safer bet, the wraps seem to be fresher and better quality. The pizzas and like are not really my cup of tea, too greasy (it's a good thing the gym is near by, you'd probably need it afterwards). Overall the quality is better than most takeaways, but not as good as some of the sandwich and deli shops around nearby Nicholson St. It is cheaper however.\n\nIf you want to spend a long time sipping coffee and taking the atmosphere in, go elsewhere. If you want a quick bite to eat on your way elsewhere or some coffee to go, Coffee (just off the) Corner is adequate."
1,"Service? Here? Yeah right.\nI was seated in the middle of the main walkway. I could have asked to sit somewhere but I was short on time and needed to eat before I got on my plane. It would be awhile before I could eat again.\nI sat there for about 10 minutes while I watched them go take orders from other customers that walked in before me...and I was in their path. \n\nOrdered a burrito. \nIt arrived.\nTasted like a bland version of a Chipotle burrito....and I am not a fan of Chipotle.\n\nI was charged twice for my drink. Probably would have paid and not given it a second thought until I saw it later, but at $3.50 a soda. It was VERY obvious.\n\nNext time I'll eat before I get through security or try another concourse."
1,"Mediocre buffet with a good selection of desserts (except for the cheap tasting gelato).\n\nDespite the Wynn-fanciness, the ambiance still felt like a chinsy buffet.  \n\nMy work has better food.  I wouldn't do this place again."
1,"My burrito was tasty enough, but a) I was over halfway through it before I got a bite of meat, and b) I ordered a carne asada burrito with guacamole, and not only was there no guacamole, but there was chicken instead of beef. Now, I'd be more forgiving about this if the place were busy, but I was literally the only customer in there. The only reason it gets two stars is because, well, it WAS a relatively good burrito."
3,"Great service an great food. Barely any wait for our food but when it finally came, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sliders were. Not too wild about the ceviche though but that's all right. I'm easy to please."
0,"Food is good for a Buffet, service was good. Great place to go if you want to get ripped off. Went for lunch (lunch until 3:30pm then diner rate which is $3.00 more) arrived at 3:05 pm left at 3:52pm was charged diner rate, most places you go if you arrived at lunch time that is what you are charged for. Used a 15% off coupon which they took but did not deduct . The most interesting thing is that the receipt was time printed 4:46pm almost an hour after I left. Needless to say I won't go Back there, and will not recommend this place to anyone, If this review help anyone to avoid this place good if it helps in putting this place out of business great!"
4,"Best breakfast in Phoenix hands-down!\nLove, love, love the Chop and chick!  The pork chop is cooked perfectly.  First time ever I've had a pork chop cooked and seasoned perfectly that I didn't make myself :)"
4,"I moved to Pittsburgh last October, and knew that I was going to continue with crossfit and had to find a gym ASAP.  Little did I know that after I moved to the Southside, that I lived across the street from the greatest fitness club I have ever been to. \n\nI have been doing crossfit for over a year now and am COMPLETELY addicted.  I started out back in Orange County trying out several of the clubs available throughout the area.  They were all good and offered knowledgeable instructors and convenient times.   So what is great about Crossfit Athletics in the Southside.  1. The owner 2. the People 3. The People\n\nNot only is the owner, Jenn, passionate about crossfit and teaching, but also she is a certified chiropractor.  So basically whenever you tweek your back or legs, she can immediately tell you what to do to quickly recover, and she offers chiropractic appointments at the gym.  Everyone that does crossfit knows that recovery is just as important as the WOD, and it does not get any better than having a specialist as your instructor.\n\nFinally the people at this gym are amazing, everyone proactively works with you to motivate and help you during the WODs.  You really feel like you are part of a family, especially with all the monthly events, competitions, and festivities. \n\nSo if you are new to crossfit fitness or an expert, definitely drop by and let the gym do the talking for itself."
3,Love this theater! Can't get more comfortable or convenient when it comes to pressing a button and food/drinks just magically appearing ... well not entirely magical as it does come at a price ... I think it is a bit too over priced but worth it for a treat now and again. The seats in both areas (full service and regular seats) are extremely comfortable and make it hard to imagine sitting in a regular theater again!
3,The service is what makes this place a restaurant worth returning.  This Glendale location is better than the ones closer to my house.
2,"On the way over I was arguing with my wife on the phone.  When I got there I was all pumped up.  I ordered the salad bar.  \n\nMy friend ordered a tuna sandwich.  We both had water.\n\nI made a pretty basic salad: iceberg, greens and baby spinach; red onion; olives; pumpernickel croutons; other things and balsamic vinagrette.  Those little ginger muffins they have are siq.  I had a bunch of them.\n\nI spilled my guts to my homie about my situation.  He listened pretty well.  I felt a little better afterward and a little awkard.  \n\nLunch was pretty good though."
4,"Live nearby and can't believe I haven't been sooner. Guess because it never seemed busy. \nIntimate place, great for couples or double date. \nVery good seafood at reasonable price for a higher end restaurant. \nGood wine list. \nG\nTry the most excellent creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - one of the best in Madison as they add a little liquor to the sugar before carmelizing the top and it is outstanding. \nAlso, sides are very good and reasonably priced. \nService last Friday was excellent. We went in late, and they made us feel very welcome and not rushed at all, which is more than one can say for some of our other high end restaurants in town."
2,"I recently stayed at the Luxor for 3 nights from August 9th through 12th. I had a room in the East Towers, so I can't speak on the conditions of the rooms located in the pyramid. The room was large with a flat screen TV and nice sized Tub and Shower in the bathroom. \n\nThe only negative about the room, was the darkness of the pyramid and being on the opposite side of the strip! I also didn't have internet the entire time I was there, no biggie I'm in VEGAS no need for that! \n\nI did notice a lot of families at the Luxor compared to other hotels I viewed that weekend, but I like the layout, the design, and the convenience it provided for our group during our stay. \n\nI would stay here again, but it doesn't have the wow factors of other hotel/casinos on the strip simply because its older and more established and not as fancy or popular these days. \n\nSo, if you need to save some bucks and want a nice place to rest while you enjoy the other Hotels Vegas has to offer,  I would recommend a stay here. \n\nSOLID 3 STARS**"
1,"Food is great! BUT... customer service is about the worst I have ever seen. I immediately thought of a skit on The Chappelle Show called \""Pop Copy\"" (YouTube it!). It was like they were frustrated that I interrupted whatever what ever they had going on to give them some business. What is unfortunate is I punish myself by going back again and again because their chicken is so good. There is never a greeting, a thank you, a please come again or anything positive. Even when I pull up to the drive through window I receive a look of disgust, like \""why are you bothering me\"". Chicken Kings food will only take them so far, at some point I am not going to find their negative attitude humorous."
3,"We got delivery from Chilly Jilly'z for lunch at work. Jilly delivered the food and was really friendly.\nI got the TABLT...it was nice and full of all the ingredients, the ciabatta bread was really good but it was a bit thick and made the sandwich too \""bready\"" but the sandwich had great flavor. I also got to try the Canyon Caprese but it was on focaccia bread, the flavor on this was really good as well. Again I had the same too much bread complaint. For the size of the sandwich it was a good price. I got a side of potato salad which was good as well, nice chunks of potato. \nI'm looking forward to trying the broasted chicken and ice cream!"
0,They stop and give me a ticket and a hot female can just get off. That's bs phx pd. Kiss my you know what.
3,"Have been going to Pappaduex's off and on for awhile now.  Seems like I go through spurts where I wind up there several times in a row then not going back for what seems like a year.  That said, this chain is consistently good.  The service is always good, some times better than others but never bad.  \nIt is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic, it is good.  The alligator is lip smackin' good.\nThe atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.  Not a good place for a romantic meal, but a good place to have fun with friends."
0,Been waiting forever to order something and others said they have been here for almost an hour with no food yet
0,Terrible customer service. Waited about an hour just to get a normal car wash I don't understand. There is no reason a car wash to take that just just to be normal. Didn't even clean the inside good
3,A good place to go for tacos and drinks!
0,"We have not been to native in quiet a long time.  We decided to go to here and the service was horrible.  The food was just ok.  We tried to mention to the manage of the bad service and it seem to go in one ear and out the other.  The bar area is very loud and the bartender and service in the bar area was aweful.  They are very rude and just seem very uninterested in waiting on tables.  I would rather make the drive elsewhere to have better service than at this place!  If you can avoid it, that would be my suggestion."
3,"You should know you can do bottle service and get a table for a show, but decide that before you buy your first round. One vodka cran = $13. Bottle of Skyy vodka and a table is $200+tax and they go up from there. In fact, you should PREGAME in the casino or in your room if nothing else. $13 is crazy to me, for a vodka cran. I pay half that in GA (different worlds).. and it's especially wacky since right outside the venue in Mandalay Bay you sit at a machine and start getting your drinks free.  PREGAME.\n\nDespite that, the staff is super nice. Natalie behind the bar is excellent, and the girl who handles the bottle service is also very sweet. \nI haven't been to any House of Blues in quite a while, and this was definitely my first time at this one. The venue is pretty awesome.  It feels like a short distance from the stage to the back of the room, and the \""pit\"" area is lower than the surrounding bar area, so it feels like most spots give you a pretty good view. Fairly easy access to the bars even when it was as packed as it was gonna get all night, although I'm sure it's not always easy. And if you care, the curtain on stage was suuuper cute. It was a patchwork quilt that I just wanted to curl up in.\n\nThere's a second floor/balcony seating, but they didn't seem to be allowing many people up there while we were there.  The stairs were blocked off at the main entrance, and we were not sure why, or who was already up there, but you could see a crowd. \n\nThis particular show - The Neighbourhood and Kitten - was All Ages.. which was weird to me. So there were a ton of teens, including the ones standing in front of us whom at first I was hoping would leave to go to the bar (before I realized they were probably underage). There are plusses, though, to sharing a concert with so many under-21s: Less people at the bar, and I can see over the whole crowd!"
4,"I found this gem on Yelp (go figure)and have taken numerous shirts, jackets, pants, and dresses etc.to be cleaned.  This company lives up to it's name.  The staff is prompt, professional, and reliable.  The owner takes customer service very seriously and values customer loyalty.  I used the spend $30 for $50 coupon on the yelp site and redeemed it from my phone.  It was a true breeze.  The owner (I'm assuming) explained they have delivery service free of charge.  I agree witb his philosophy- dry cleaning should be hassle free.  Quality work every time, no exceptions.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but absolutely the best.  You get what you pay for.  Cheers!  \n\nOne request for the owner: please put a fan (or anything to cool) in the receiving area.  That place can get toasty for those that choose to pick up in person."
3,"Went to AZ for a trip and saw a movie in this theater, looks like this is a local chain. \nI would say that its pretty clean atleast when i went. The screen size is decent and chairs are comfy."
3,"I'll be honest:  I avoided this place for years because the name is just ridiculous.  It's hard to say.  It makes me sound lispy, and I just don't like it.  Now, my fairer half--who finds herself quite often having to talk sense into me when I'm too analytical and ridiculous (in this case, concerning a restaurant name)--is from New Orleans and explained to me the story of Chris' Steakhouse, and of Ruth's subsequent purchase of Chris' name, and thus the lispy-sounding restaurant that would become Ruth's Chris.  She also forced (or strongly encouraged) me to eat at Ruth's Chris to cure me of my aversion to eating here.  \n\nI really don't crave steak often, but I enjoy eating one here when I do.  The asparagus is pretty damn tasty, and the stuffed mushroom caps are to die for.  And you could actually die if you eat too many of them.  My main reason for visiting Ruth's is to drink scotch with my lady (who, because she is awesome, also drinks scotch) and while away the afternoon, chatting with the friendly bartenders and gazing at each other through hazy, bloodshot eyes.  Mushroom caps and Macallan 18 are the way to a woman's heart, my friends.  Yes indeed."
1,"You'd think it'd be pretty easy to have a successful restaurant with menu based mostly off of bacon, but Bacon Bar will prove that wrong. \n\nFor starters, the bacon jalape\u00f1os were one of the worst things I've ever eaten. No texture whatsoever. Mushy, overcooked jalape\u00f1os with soggy, limp bacon. And they added maple syrup to them as well, which wasn't listed on the menu.\n\nWe got THE bacon burger, and while it wasn't that bad, it still wasn't what we ordered. It's supposed to have bacon ground with the beef. Instead there was only bacon on top, and it was dry and overcooked. The burger also came with tomato confit on it which also wasn't listed in the menu description. So both things we ordered came with additional ingredients that weren't on the menu. \n\nOur server was really somethin too. There was nobody in the restaurant and while we were waiting for our food, she sat at the bar and ate her dinner while she was on her phone.\n\nWe won't be back."
0,"I understand everyplace has its rules. My friends had a pre-wedding party here. And at 10pm it becomes a \"" standing bar\"" only. But did your staff have to be rude to the parents who were still sitting down a little respect goes a long way. We will not be going back."
2,"The Blind Pig is certainly an interesting establishment.  A butcher shop, restaurant and a bar all rolled into one business.  I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the concept.  But no matter... no matter that my big scientific brain can't get itself wrapped around the idea.  The food that I tasted and the drinks that I had were yummy.\n\nI stopped in here one evening to have a quick dinner.  The restaurant is small and it was almost full, so I sat at the bar.  Discovered that this restaurant/butcher shop is a member of the Uncle Sal's/Side Door family of businesses.  I also like it when I go to a restaurant and the regulars are chatty.  (this place is new and it already had some folks who say they'd been there every week since it opened)  I'm sitting alone, so it was great.  Just about everyone in the restaurant engaged in the conversation.  \n\nThe ladies waiting at the bar were extremely helpful with my selection.  I wanted to taste something prepared with the bacon infused marinade that they sell at the butcher counter.  Unfortunately, nothing on the menu is prepared with that.  However, the bartender was nice enough to suggest the closest item on the menu to that kind of taste.  That item would be the pig wings.  Yummy, what an amazing dish.  I think pig wings are starting to take flight!  The wings were flavorful, juicy and succulent.  They had a nice BBQ flavor to them, yet were not too saucy for my liking.  I also ordered their version the Mosow mule.  That was a 3 star drink.  \n\nI did not take home anything from th butcher shop.  The meat from the butcher shop is from the acclaimed Hobe Meats of Phoenix, also owned by the same owners.  Perhaps when I want a standing rib roast, I will check here the next time.  \n\nThere is a large area out front for seating as well.  this is a solid place to go to after work or a baseball game during the nice spring evenings."
4,"Love this place. Food is consistent and I think really good. Wait staff is available but in no way try to hurry you. It's relaxing and comfortable. The burger, pizza and chicken sandwich are excellent choices."
1,"I was there for a conference and I am a local. I didn't stay in the hotel but I was there for over 8 hours so I used the conference room and ate lunch there. The food selection was OK, but it is similar to other casino's. I ate at Metro Pizza. The reason for the low rating has to do with the conference room. The group didn't purchase a group wireless internet package so in order for us to get wifi, we had to purchase it on our own. Not usually a bad thing until I was told by their sales office that it is $24.95 for one hour and $80 for the day. Are you serious? My monthly high speed internet is only  $50 for the month. I was attending a conference and usually it is included or a nominal fee to get it, but $25 for one hour is ridiculous.  Stay away from them if you need wifi while on the premises. They do offer a basic wifi with the room but charge an additional $8 to get decent speeds. Caution if you need good wifi speeds."
3,I must say I was very skeptical about this club crawl but after actually doing it I can say it was one of my favorite moments of my trip!!! The biggest issue for me was calling to make the reservation 24 hours in advance. I had completely forgotten to do that and they accommodated me nonetheless.  \n\nThe host and hostess that we had that evening were off the hook fun!!!!! They interacted with us and we had a Freaking BALL!!!!\n\nI have to say that after leaving the club it did seem rather uncoordinated as we did not know what bus to get on and we would be send to one bus and it was already full. There needs to be some kind of set bus assignments for people or at least someone to count the people getting on. \n\nAt the end of the day this was well worth the $ and it was an awesome time!!!!
2,"This really amounts to 3.5 stars.  I think after seeing all of the stellar reviews combined with my LOVE for Filipino food, my expectations were just too high.\n\nI took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if I had finally found a local Filipino eatery to curb my cravings.  Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.\n\nI was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.  They were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them.  Also again, it may be just what I am used to, but I've always had ones which are longer with more fillings - stuff you can actually see and taste what's in them.\n\nOn a positive note, the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful.  It makes me want to like it even more.  I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.\n\nA few tips:\n*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.\n*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.  There were only a few other tables to seat 2.\n\nI really wanted to like you Karey's Kitchen..."
4,"Great hole in the wall restaurant. Recently remodeled so it fits a lot more guests. Our favorites here are the Bulgogi burrito, tostadas and the tacos. The portions are huge and the prices are cheap!! They're always so welcoming and friendly, this is why we always come back when we crave fusion."
0,"Disappointed. The noodles in the chow mein were no more than plain spaghetti noodles.  Nothing had that great of quality. The cashew chicken was alright but I've had much better.. Everything was just ok, don't think we'll be trying again"
1,"Not impressed...I was in Scottsdale for a few days on business and decided to get a relaxing pedicure in my free time.  After reading the reviews I decided to try Pro Nails by Julie.  When I called to make an appt I specifically asked for Julie since she is the one mentioned in most of the reviews.  The place is clean and they do have a nice selection of colors.  I sat down in the chair and was given a bottle of water which is a nice touch but when it came to the cuticle clipping and filing it was awful.  She hardly clipped my cuticles at all and she filed my toenails crooked and they were all different lengths!! This is Julie, the owner? I live in Southern CA and you can go to any nail shop and get a better job for a much better price.  I paid $33 for basically a polish change and a little lotion on my legs and the massage that other Yelpers reviewed about being so good? ummm not so much...I really wish Bliss wasnt booked solid I would have gladly paid an extra $20 for a good job."
0,"All I can say is....If you have been to the Carnegie deli in New York skip this place.  \nThey have no pickled tomatoes, the corned beef was plentiful, but fatty/tough (so go for the turkey), the break was okay, but not great either.  How hard is it to make a sandwich when that is nearly all you make.  Won't come again.  Afterward I heard  from other friends/family that they felt the same way and wished I knew before I wasted my money and time."
3,"This is a great old steakhouse.  The steak was delicious.  Perhaps we went on an off night because they ran out of porterhouse and the steak came out cold.  The steak was really delicious and the service and atmosphere were great so I'm really going to chalk it up to an unlucky night because all the sides were delicious and I really can't complain about anything else.  I would definitely give this place another chance because if you can love it even after eating cold steak, it must be good."
0,"Horrible. Worst McDonald's ever. I don't understand how the \""machines\"" can always be broken. I stop for a hot chocolate, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a smoothie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a cookie, but no the machine is broken. I stop for a sundae, but no the machine is broken. I wonder if the machines are really always broken or if these people are just idiots. Officially done with this place."
0,"I think it's rare that I give a one star review because I always try to be the optimistic patron. Granted. However, my/our experience at Caramel was right up there with HORRIBLE.  A friend who is a local recommended this place since it's more of a lounge scene and not an obnoxious nightclub.  \n\nWe were a group of 5, walked in on a Sun. night around 11pm, some top 40 hit was being mixed loudly overhead.  Proceeded to the bar, my friend asked the bartender if he could recommend any specialty drinks with bourbon or whiskey. Two things - 1. Yes, she knows that these are not typical alkies to mix but we did just read a FULL article (with pics and recipes !) in the LV magazine about bartenders and their creative elixirs using whiskey and bourbon and 2. Most exotic concoctions are made with vodka but she reacts how I do on tequila - BAD, BAD, BAAAD news.\n\nHis response ? Rolled his eyes, got on his high and mighty hat and said \""people who drink whiskey and bourbon don't mix them with anything\"" Really !?! Because last time I checked, when I'm paying close to $20 f*(*ing dollars for a drink I don't think I asked for judgment from a Las Vegas bartender.  So, while my friend tried to ignore his arrogance and decide on a drink, we ordered for the 3 people who were ready.  After he made the drinks he said he HAD to close out the tab on the 3 drinks, to which we said we still needed 2 more and he just said \""well, I HAVE to close out the tab while you guys decide.\"" Gee, I must be the idiot that thought bars make their money off drinks and not forcing people the close out when they're not ready.  I've actually never had this happen before.\n\nMaybe my illustration didn't fully justify how RUDE AND ARROGANT he was but we were completely disgusted.  If we are going to pay $80 for 5 drinks I'd appreciate at least a basic level of courtesy, esp. from an a$$ho&e bartender who works for tips."
4,"Driving on 16th street and what do I see?...a store with obvious charm and vintage fun , I whisper \""  that place is cool \"" , my husband being the smart guy he is says \""Do you want to go ? \""YES\""  I yell .  It was a wonderful moment . \n\nAnd he immediately obliges with a u turn executed with  finesse.  We arrive back at the Bees Knees and I fall in  love  with the murals running on the sides of the building , a giant  bee , a whimisical skull , a graphic mural ... Dee-- Lightful . \n\nConfession: I love vintage clothes , big bold patterns , amazing textures , great details ...it calls to me .... Stores that sell vintage clothes make me happy.  Stores that sell cool old clothes that don't smell like attics are even more wonderful.\n\nThe Bees Knees has impressive racks of womens and mens clothes with funky hipness that screams UNIQUENESS. Prices are very reasonable , wide range of sizes and the qualtiy  is good.  Not everything is old , but the colors and lines are interesting and hip.  They also sell local artist jewelry , purses knick knacks and such.  \n\nI found a beaded full skirt that has amazing textures as well as a bold print floral that is perfect for work.  hubby found a Marvin the Martian shirt that was amazing but the wrong size.\n\nThe Site also host a art space called the Hive.  You never know what might be buzzing back there. ( I aplogize for the obvious.)"
2,"Clean rooms, just wish they had longer restaurant options. Food they have is good, they just need more staff."
2,"I try to eat healthy, I do, so I checked out G&P to see if it lives up to the hype.  I had dinner here on Monday night with a vegan friend and it certainly has that SoCal, clean and green vibe going on.  The staff is super friendly and greeted us warmly as we perused the menu.  I'd already looked it up online prior to arriving and I just cannot believe their smoothies and wellness drinks cost so much!  You need a healthy wallet to drink healthy there!  Even with a Yelp check-in that gives you a $1 off, I still could not justify spending even $6.50 for a smoothie.  So, I went with the turkey club in a wheat wrap with tofu fries.  The wrap was great and the tofu fries were...interesting.  I just kept wishing they were real fries, but I did say I TRY to eat healthy.  My friend had the vegan pizza and she loved hers, but she also is a regular customer and has a much healthier wallet than I do.  I find it interesting that this joint which promotes health and wellness also advertises that it has an HCG-friendly menu--isn't HCG unsafe, illegal, and not approved by the FDA?  Anyway, overall, if you're vegan, vegetarian, or want to take a walk on the healthier side, come to Greens and Proteins.  They certainly live up to their name!"
1,"Dry cleaning is over twice as expensive as the cleaners I use back home in Chicago.\n\nAlso I have had two shirts come back heavily starched, when I requested no starch.\n\nTheir service has always been very prompt, which is why I didn't leave just one star."
1,"Ordered 2 hoagies, one steak, one Italian. $23 and some change....there was more lettuce than anything on both hoagies. One very thin layer of meat on both. I won't be back. \n\nIts a shame they're so skimpy because the bread is excellent. Could be amazing hoagies if they made half an effort.  Oh well, too many great places around to try that again."
2,"We came here as we were staying at the Cosmopolitan.  This is a gourmet burger place.  I like their idea of selling shakes with alcohol. The wife had the surf & turf mini burgers and I had a burger with Kobe beef, potato chips and cheddar cheese (can't remember the name of the burger). We also had the Oreo shake with Baileys and kettle chips with blue cheese and French onion dipping sauce.  The surf & turf wasn't very good as it had this tiny piece of lobster with beef tenderloin.  The Kobe burger was good with a nice crunch from the potato chips but it feel short compared to other gourmet burgers I've had.  The Oreo shake was good but had very little alcohol.  A beer would've been better with the burger rather than the milk shake.  The potato chips were a good starter for our meal.  I'm glad we tried this place but not sure if we would come back."
2,"The food was good, but this place didn't 'Wow' me.\n\nI had a turkey burger (on a Friday in Lent, God help me), which was pretty good, but I've had better. The fries were really good. And the hot fudge milkshake was super yummy!"
1,"Service was pretty good, food was pretty mediocre.  For the price, they get 2/5 stars.  I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).\n\nThe main dings are from:\n1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare.\n2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.\n\nThey do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.  \n\nThe main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).\n\nOverall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.  If you really want a great steak, you may be disappointed."
4,"Picked up a truck here for a one-way move to Colorado and although U-Haul didn't really have its act together as a company (we had to pick up the truck here, then head up Fort Apache for a ways to an entirely different location to pick up our tow dolly for the car), that doesn't reflect on this location whatsoever.\nThe gentleman behind the counter got us in and out rapidly, and I was quickly made aware of all the details of the rental and how to return the truck, which was greatly appreciated. He also made me feel like a valued customer even in that brief space of time; he may well have been the store manager that was mentioned in a previous review, as he seemed that organized and professional (but still entirely friendly!), but I'm not sure.\nIn any case, if you need to rent a U-Haul truck in southwestern Las Vegas, this is your place, and that's your guy."
2,"pros:\n-got in for free\n-decent music\n-car crash like go go dancers (can't look away)\n-sexy decor\n\ncons:\n-crowded like no other.  there was barely room to move.\n-the only place to sit were these benches where a candle fell on my friends head\n-nearly impossible to get drinks\n-tiny, tiny, tiny dance floor\n-foam is gross\n-weird layout\n\nI don't know if I would go again, but getting in for free saved this place.  That and they played \""Sweet Caroline.\"""
0,"Ate here last night 6/29/2014.  Me and 4 others ate here and towards paying our bill, one of my friends noticed a B grade hanging up near the kitchen as well as a C grade near the entrance door.  If we noticed this before eating we wouldn't have eaten here.  This is my 2nd time eating at this place and never seen a grade for a restaurant with a B.  or either both a C.  If you plan on eating here, I would think twice.  This restaurant needs to update their grade.  Will not eat here again until this issue is resolved"
4,"Make sure you pull into this place caddy corner with a hunger for some real Mexican.  For real caddy corner, although illegal, use the pedestrian ramp  on the NW corner to launch into the parking lot.  Works best for leaving, when the place is packed. This place has some of the best tortillas, frijoles, chorizo and quesedillas in town.  The other Mexican joints are trying to do what Carolina's has been doing for years....  The only con is they aren't open on Sundays and that they could call in the amigos to renovate the place a bit...."
0,"Twice we ordered take out as Rosati's isn't far from our house and we had guests. Both times they lost our order, the 1st time we weren't told this until after we paid!!  The second time we called and mentioned the problem to avoid a repeat missed order, and they did it again! lol!  \nAnd both times it took well over 30 minutes to get our order and on second time the order wasn't complete and that took 10 more minutes to fix!\nWhat's the saying......'fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?'  We haven't been back since!   And btw, the food wasn't anything special!"
3,"Just bought a home and decided to use Wave House based on the yelp reviews. I didn't scrutinize the job right away as I had many other companies coming out for bids on work that needed to be done to the home so I was pretty tied up to really inspect it. But it appeared to be clean.\n\nLater that evening i saw the stove and showers were not cleaned very well at all. There was alot of soap and hard water residue left behind, I could run my hand over the tiles and my hand was very chalky. The stove was still pretty crusty also. \nThe office mgr., Melissa (I beleive) followed up the next day on the cleaning, I explained my disappointment and she immediately offered for the girls to come back and rectify it. I initially declined, and then later decided to have them come back. \n\nThey came out the next day and re-cleaned the stove and only 1 of the showers. I didn't say anything about the 2nd shower to them as I already felt very uncomfortable  about them coming back to re-clean, knowing that I complained about their cleaning.  (I really don't like addressing a job that is not well done with someone, they look at you cross, like how dare you complain about the job I performed) \n\nLater that night I started to unpack the boxes and get my house in order and that's when I really started noticing how dirty everything was still. I paid  for a deep move in clean. There was no furniture in the house so nothing in the way of them being able to clean all the nooks and crannies. I paid extra for all the windows, sliders and inside the cabinets and fridge to be cleaned.  They missed several cabinets shelves all together, that were very very dusty and cleaned the others poorly. There was still dirt & crumbs in several of the drawers, and dirt in corners of the cabinets. \n\nThe slider and window tracts were supposed to be cleaned as part of the window cleaning that I paid extra for, they were not cleaned very well, there was still dirt & grime in them. There was debris/particles all along the baseboards, in every room, that were not vacuumed. Dirt left in corners of the tile floors. They did a surface clean, but not a very thorough deep clean, which is what I paid for. I wanted it sparkling and sanitized, and it is not even close.\n\nMelissa did call after they came back out to follow up and I just let it go to voicemail and didn't call back to say anything about what I was seeing. I know they can't fix it if i don't say something, but I didn't want them to send out the same girls again and I have to point out all the areas they didn't clean properly, it is extremely unnerving to have to do that. \n\nI would give them 1 star based on their cleaning abilities. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because of Melissa's customer service skills. I would never use them again and feel it was a complete waste of $220.\n\nI would recommend that if there are issues with a cleaning that you send out someone else so the customer is not dealing with \""glares\"".\n\n\n**Owner contacted me after seeing the review, he offered me a few different options to rectify the situation. I have decided to change my review to 4 stars from 2, due to the customer service I received in response to the situation. No one is perfect, but they were willing to make sure I was taken care of and satisfied, that is all you can ask for from a company. I would give them another opportunity to clean my home."
0,Worst bar ever! Full of old middle aged people the staff is rude and uptight ! It's always empty on the weekends which says aloe about this place. I have given this place a few chances never pleased . I rather go to zipps
3,"Location is perfect!\nJust uphill from Waverley Station, and a street over from the Royal Mile.\nThere are quite a few restaurants and pubs just a short walk away.\n\nThe staff here was great, very friendly and willing to suggest a pub or place to eat...even drawing us a map, to a few sites that we wanted to see.\n\nThe room seemed dated and in need of some work, (paint and new carpet could do wonders).\nBut it was very clean, nice linens & comfortable bed, and great wifi.\nWe had a room facing the station, which had a great view.\n\nOverall, a great place to rest after a day or two of walking around Edinbough, will stay here again."
0,"Horrible!!! This is no way to treat veterans! The doctor that attended to me was so unprofessional he kept saying \""do you know what I'm sayin?\"" too much slang!

0,"RUDE OWNER!\nWe have been going to Grimaldi's now Grazzianos for 10 years.  We are a family of 5 and My stepson who is 26, and husband are BIG eaters. They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys. Anyhoooo....\nIf you order hot wings it must be in increments of at least 6 and you get a dressing. If you order in increments of 12, you still only get one dressing. So my stepson has 2 orders of 6, just so he can get his 2 dressings. Well when they refused to give him 2, without charging him the extra .59 cents. I mean the money won't break us, but the principal of it all is crazy. So he calls the owner over and asks her. As soon as she got to our table she was rude and told him in a tone \""so basically your wanting to get out of paying the extra .59 cents. No\"" I have never seen a restaurant owner speak to someone like this. Then we called her back when the food arrived, and she struts over to our table and first thing out of her mouth was \""Now what?!\"" Really? That left a bad taste in our mouth and he told her \""forget it. Give me the check for the drinks and salad. We are leaving\"" She argues and says \""over .59 cents?\"" He says \""No. Over your attitude, I did not need to be talked to like that\"" She says \""You don't understand how expensive ranch dressing is!\"" In her condescending tone. I was floored. She lost our weekly business for sure. Now, as a restaurant owner she should have written off the ranch dressing as we have been loyal customers for YEARS. The other people who work there are nice and I feel bad for them, if she treats her customers like this imagine how she treats them. I hope she sees this review and responds with her feedback. SHE has no one to blame  for lost business but herself."
0,Don't bother to go to this location. Their notary isn't on premise regularly and it'll be a waste of a trip.  Terrible service model.
2,"I want to love this place. But, I just can't.  I felt like they were a mediocre burger place with a great beer list.\n\nWhen I walked in, I just stood there. As a first time patron, I had no idea that I was supposed to seat myself. There is no giving you an indication of this \""seat yourself\"" policy. I found a table, but it had no menus. At first I did not find this strange until I realized that all of the other tables had menus. When you re set a table, ensuring it has menus is important. \n\nI ordered the bruschetta and pesto burger which was delicious!  However, the size?  5 oz. for $7.59 with no size. There was nothing about this burger that made up for the price. It was tasty but small. Sides are extra. The options are fresh cut fries, shoe string fries or sweet potato fries. After you add a side of fries to a burger, you are looking at a $10 meal. That is a little crazy for what you get.\n\nMy dinner companion ordered the mac and cheese with bacon burger. The components were delicious (of course I sneaked a bite), but the burger itself was not great as a whole. It was dry. Maybe a cheese sauce would have helped?  \n\nThe beer menu is HUGE. There are a ton of great brews to try but otherwise, this place is just ok."
4,"Ray and his team are awesome. Called to repair my disposal and they came right out. They Called to confirm, called when they were on their way. I had to cancel my appointment to pick up my son, but Ray made sure I was completed before I needed to leave so I didn't have to cancel. Just great service from beginning to end!"
2,"I thought the steak needed more flavor.   It was too greasy, and not in the good way.  Fries okay.  Onion rings clearly not fresh.   It's a great idea with not so good on execution.  OK, not great.   It seems like there is potential, but needs help."
1,"Poor and inconsistent service.   \n\nRates are high with requirements other rental companies dont have not to mention it was like they were doing me a favor for me to spend 600 bucks with them. \n\n Don't even try to rent if you use a debit card need everything from references, utility statements and first born. \n\nRecommend checking other rental agencies that appreciate return customers and more than likely have better rates."
2,"Taco Tuesday was not made for me...they should try real tacos before naming theirs tacos. The deep fried cheesecake burrito is a mix of bland flavours, that won't satisfy your search for an original dessert.\n\nAnyway, the good deal is the beer price and their patio. Tuesdays are also empty, so you can even get good attention. The unexpected? they have board games and even WII. \""Still looking real tacos in Phx area\""."
4,"Great food, good selection of veg curries at buffet (choose from 6).\n\nFresh and tasty garlic naan.\n\nTastefully done interiors and decor.\n\nClean bathroom with diaper changing station.\n\nOur little one was sleeping, she woke up 10 mins before 3 pm (close) and they accommodated us for 15 mins after close while she ate."
0,"I reserved full-size SUV from dollar, and I thought I were the luckiest person since they said that they will give me a free upgrade. When I was wondering how a full-size SUV is upgraded, the staff just give me a compact-size Chevy SUV with a few of dents. The car is abused so very hard to drive. The steer wheel just is unpredictable. I double checked with them, and they insist that trash is what I ordered. Not returning the money due to providing lower class car, no apology in any way.   \n  This company is totally a shame. I have never been deceived like this. Keep away from Dollar because you actually pay more than the cost of renting from other companies."
2,"My mom, my son & myself stayed here for a night.  The location is fantastic - everything one could imagine is within a 1-2 mile radius.  Food, groceries, gas, etc.\n\nWe did NOT eat breakfast here so I cannot comment on that. \n\nThe beds, although they claim they were doubles, were nothing more than a slightly over sized twin; my son & I could barely sleep comfortably.  \n\nVery quiet though considering it's right off of Greenway & 17.  \n\nA decent value."
4,This place is AWESOME!!! My first time I ever had a peddi. They made me feel right at home and treated me lik a king. The service was top notch. She painted a perfect Texas Longhorn on my big toe too. I have no idea why I haven't done this sooner.
2,"My last review is a bit old, and I still come here, so I figured I should update.\n\nI had to drop a star.  Our past several stops here we've noticed that they are ALWAYS short-handed.  If there are three people waiting, there seems to be one person on the floor (who has to handle adjustments, folks getting new glasses, or whatever).  If there are five people waiting there are two people helping.  This time they were particularly full -maybe 10 people- and only two seemed to be working the floor.  I swear to you it didn't used to be that bad.  I can remember seeing all four of their stations busy helping customers.  Not anymore.  Makes for long waits and a lot of \""I'll be right with you\"".  The staff appears to be doing their best, but they're just perpetually understaffed lately.\n\nThe frame selection also seems to have declined a bit.  They still have the same number of frames on display (as near as I can tell), but many are so similar as to be basically the same as many others.  Not a lot of variety to the look of the frames now.  While I was happy they brought Armani back (they make good frames...pricey, but good), the selection was extremely limited.  I liked one, but it was only the one size (too big for me).  Disappointing.\n\nTheir fitting system is pretty high-tech now, using special markers attached to the frames to get the relevant measurements to grind your glasses for you.  And they can take several images of you wearing different frames so you can compare side-by-side.  That's nice.\n\nThey do seem to stand behind their work, though they have tightened up their policies.  But we have had very little trouble here, and on one occasion the manager personally handled it for us.  He's not there all the time, but when he is there he is a take-charge guy who appears to want to have happy customers."
2,Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Not the most amazing Thai ever. I do highly recommend the coconut ice cream.
0,"I can't comment on the quality of the meat because due to the poor attitude of the staff, we purchased nothing from here. When my husband tried to inquire on the price of a specific cut off meat, the guy at the counter was very curt with us, acting as if we were bothering him. He pointed to where the price was (difficult to see because of the people standing in front of it), and stalked off.  Obviously our business was not wanted. No problem. We won't set foot in there again."
2,"our host had the slow shuffle and glazed look common to failing business owners and death row inmates. you could almost hear the steady murmur of \""dead man walking\"" above some silly FOX show (yeah, i know that's redundant) playing on the widescreen. \n\nthe restaurant was empty except for our party of four. that's never, ever a good sign especially on a friday evening at 7:30 when everything should be jumping. too bad, really, 'cause the food, though kinda generic, was pretty good. \n\nPAD THAI, the kid's favorite. was quite good. less catsup and sugar than most incarnations, the sauce had a nice tamarind tang. JULIANA and WYATT shared an order and finished most of it. \n\nmy wife's SPICY PORK and EGGPLANT was better than most -- i managed to snag a taste when she wasn't looking. \n\ni had the PANANG BEEF CURRY spicy and it actually had a little kick -- that alone was fairly unique in my recent experience. nice flavor with green beans and bell pepper. \n\ni don't know about the previous 74 but would say the 75th THAI TASTE was pretty good."
0,"Came here for dinner. Quick seating and low price $20.\nThe atmosphere feels very old-medieval-esque. To my taste, too dull and quiet. Not too many young people either. Mainly middle-aged and on, or small families.\nMy waitress wasn't responsive. Once we had our order of drinks, that was it, she never returned.\nThe food selection is mediocre. Most of the chefs don't smile and seem to growl every time you request something.\nThere's a Mongolian section where you select your vegetables and your meat option. The chef makes the plate of food for you within 5 minutes. But, the leftover food bits from the previous order(s) weren't fully scraped off. Had little black bits throughout my plate. Hate to waste food, but definitely not risking my stomach.\nBest choice for me was the porkchops. Soft and tasty. Everything else, meh. Even the desserts weren't to par.\nVery disappointed."
4,This first experience has been fantastic. My brother received a FREE large one-topping pizza for his bday. Be sure to come at 4:45 for your pizza from a freshly stoked oven. Perfectly cooked with fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce. The Caesar and caprese salads were a great starter. We'll be returning for the great pie! Don't forget the tiramisu.
1,Standing room on the side balconies was waaaaaay over packed. We paid big bucks to see Muse and could barely see them at times. They really over sold this show.
1,The pho is alright. Seems like if you ask for a large they just give you more soup. Bad service. I had asked for a refill & the waiter cleaned two tables right in front of me & still didn't get me a refill. Asked again & cleaned three more tables & yet still didn't get me a refill. Ended up asking another waiter for a refill.
0,"Nothing is new here about my bad experience. But hopefully I can shed some light into their evil world. And then the travelers can choose wisely.\n\nUS Worst has retained its title for me in 2011.\n\nTypical story. Mechanical failure. Flight was delayed in Palm Springs. I missed the connection in Phoenix. I was rescheduled for later flight. A delay of 4 hours.\n\nI always avoid US Worst but sometimes it's just impossible. It helps when US Worst is part of Star Alliance (Wrong... more later). I was a United Premier member. I thought I still can get my benefit on US Worst. That's a wrong assumption.\n\nI have experienced nightmares on more than 50% of US Worst flights. More so lately... 100% in past 2 years (2 flights). Luckily I've shifted all possible flights to other not so worst airlines.\n\nTo make a long tedious nightmare educational:\n1) US Worst does not recognize the full status of United Premier. Not like United and Continental.\n\n2) It's business as usual for US Worst. The costumer service rep expressed indifference. It reminds me of rental clerks in Las Vegas and FlorIda (\""you don't like it? Too bad! Move aside, there's a long line waiting for our premiere service\"") There is no apology. The mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qualify for any compensation.\n\nSo travelers, kowtow to the Almighty US Worst whom provides world class service to everyone. I wonder what service you will get in economy class."
4,"I will just say this. \n\nThe cocktails are delicious and strong.\nIf you want to drink, like, 3 and feel drunk...\n\n...So drunk, that you throw up inside your Uber ride person's car--but not on the floor or on the seat... instead, into your own pocketbook. \n\nIn return, receiving a compliment of being the best drunk ever.\n\nOther thoughts, \nThe music is loud, the lighting is nice and dark but you can still see what you're doing. Black light if I'm remembering correctly."

2,"The food is good and I'm pretty picky.  Stopped in here for lunch.  I was a little skeptical.   The space is quite large and loud and service was a little slow and disorganized.  Just as I was starting to regret the choice, our food arrived.  After one bite, all was forgiven.  I had the portabello veggie wrap.  It was served with salad on the side.  It was really really good.  Fresh ingredients, good flavor, not laden in oil or creamy dressings (most restaurants in Phoenix ruin veggie dishes by loading them down with fat and cheese).   I will come back for lunch just to have that wrap.  My cohort had the Reuben with slaw on the side.  It was also excellent and the slaw was fresh and light.  \n\nDespite being a little slow, the service was friendly, and the scene was surprisingly low key.  I came straight from a hike in sweaty outdoor gear and did not feel self-conscious.  Also, the restaurant is so big that I can't imagine there every being that long of a wait, even at peak hours.\n\nPS - Do NOT get the oatmeal. I think it is actually one of those instant Quaker microwave packets.  Bad."
0,"another review for maybe a second chance to do good. i ordered the reuben sandwich for a late night craving. the meat was so thinly slices that the sandwich was just bland. best part of the meal, Susan. she was making sure that my meal was perfect but you can't blame her for the food being soso. total cost for the coffee and sandwich $19. are you kidding me."
3,"So I have been to all of the other Chompie's, and I must say that this one is the nicest looking one. I went here this morning with the BF and a couple of our friends for breakfast. So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good. \n\nAlso, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever! (a piece of kugel, a latke, a blintz, and a cup of matzo ball soup.... all of my faves on one plate.)"
2,"I met some friends at Burger 21 for lunch. All the staff was very friendly, they made a point to make it feel like a normal sit-down restaurant despite the fact that you order your food at a counter. They bring you and pick up your food when you're done. They have a large menu, including several burgers, chicken sandwiches, turkey and veggie burgers, sweet potato, regular, and cheese fries. For a healthier option, they have a few salads. However, it gets a little pricey when ordering because fries are not included in a combo price. They also have many delicious milkshakes that add to your overall bill. A sauce bar adds some uniqueness to burger 21- they have around 10 different sauces you can dip your fries in or add to your burger. Overall, I enjoyed Burger 21, but I wouldn't be able to eat there very often considering it is pretty unhealthy. I mean, how can you go to a burger place and not indulge in a burger, fries, AND a shake?"
0,"Need a new Management !!!! ...understaffed, chicken tikka have no flavor.... they cut down on the Buffet  menu items.... had to ask for water ...one waitress for the whole place ...this place is not the same ....."
2,"Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Vegas so far, which isn't saying much, since I've only had buffets). We had tickets for a show at 8pm, and ended up bumping up our reservation last minute to 530pm (when the restaurant opens) without a hitch.\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely very trendy -- black lacquer countertops, red roses, clear hurricanes of colorful peppers, fruit & red roses around an open kitchen -- and despite the business casual recommendation, there were many people in jeans and tshirts as well. \n\nAtmosphere/ service: The countertop seating gives you the best view of the kitchen, and feels like a sushi bar. The waiters are definitely attentive, probably bc they can't escape you looking at them when your'e done eating.\n\nFOOD\nMenu: There's a tasting menu, a smaller 5 course menu, tapas (about $20/ plate, NOT recommended), and traditional appetizers + main course menu. And also a theatre menu (L'Unique) with 3 courses all on one plate for $39, served in 15 min. We ordered the club menu, plus a tapas, appetizer, and dessert a la carte-- more than enough for 2 people. We enjoyed a half bottle of sparkling rose ($50, light and fruity but not recommended-- gave us headaches afterwards). \n\nOverall, the portions weren't huge but it was definitely very rich-- either with butter, cream, or heavily doused in olive oil. Such is French cooking, eh? (Actually, it was more Californian style than French, with the exception of a heavy hand in cream, butter, and olive oil in every dish.)\n\nBreaking it down: (updated from website; it's not posted there yet)\n1. Amuse bouche: foie gras, port wine reduction, and parmesan foam parfait. Salty, foamy, and well balanced, savorly bite to start the evening. Best dish of the evening.\n2. Mussels in a chowder: very creamy, also very savory and o\n3. Langosteen dumping with arugula/ spring salad - tasted like shrimp tempura, but the lobster was very tender; the salad was a pass\n4. Pounded veal - just OK\n5. Trio of goat, cow's,  and cow's cheeses (in order of robust to mild) served with walnut-raisin bread (best to eat on its own, or with a mild cheese), egg-walnut bread, and country bread (best with goat cheese). Cheeses were fresh, imported from France. \n6. Five traditional tarts slices - chocolate (just OK), white chocolate with lemon sauce, pineapple filling & earl gray toasted rice crispies (the best of the 5), chocolate cinnamon ganache (deceivingly rich), raspberry (fresh and light), and Snickers (very rich, although an actual Snickers bar isn't hard to recreate :-P)\n7. Anchovy, red bell pepper, and eggplant  confit - must eat all ingredients together for proper seasonings and savoriness. Without the anchovies, the entire dish is bland and oily. Ample servings to share. I had to eat it with bread to balance out the oil.\n8. Seasonal vegetable salad - wayyyy too much olive oil; even after eating, we had 3 tbsp left of oil on the bottom of the plate. Seasonal vegetables = olives, endives, butter lettuce, and avocado. Definitely not to be ordered again!\n9. Sorbets and ice creams - refreshing ending. 5 scoops of mandarin orange sorbet (favorite), vanilla bean, coffee (both mediocre), raspberry sorbet (light), and pistachio ice cream (second favorite) topped with sugar crisp and 2 pieces of thin chocolate.\n\nOther information:\n- Our waiter informed us all the food was shipped directly from France, including the cheese. \n- Joel Robuchon makes his own bread (complimentary, bottomless bread basket with mini baguettes, country bread rolls, and buttery plain crossaints) bc \""he couldn't find a good bakery in Vegas.\""\n- Still water costs $8 (Evian).\n- Reservations recommended, need to confirm 72 hrs in advance to secure\n- NOT for vegetarians or vegans - every dish has seafood or meat except the bread. \n- If you're allergic to shellfish, tell the restaurant in advance and they have some menu alternatives.\n\nOverall, 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5). Quite expensive ($260 including tax/ tip for the two of us) but worth the money every so often."
3,"Visited Kyara on a Saturday night. Usually I had to wait long time to get seated; however, we were seated right away this time.We ordered plum wine (choya), pork kimchi, ika butter, pork fried rice, and ramen. I have been there for more than 10 times, but the consistency of the food is absent most of the times. The noodles for the ramen tasted bad and kind of puffy. Some servers are friendly and attentive. Some need more training on customer service. I would rate Kyara better than Ichiza, but I still do think they have room for improvement in order to satisfy more customers."
4,"I can't say enough good things about this place. The cakes and cupcakes are very flavorful and well executed and also very stylish. The best thing I have to say is they have impeccable customer service. We have ordered cakes from Retro Bakery several times and they have always been on time and just as we ordered. Except today... And I still have no complaints! They not only managed to get us our cake on time but! they even threw in complimentary cupcakes and a few upgrades to the cake. This is a true American business run the right way with customer satisfaction in mind and pride in their product. If you need a cake THIS is the place to get it, hands down."
0,"How can this place get 4 star? More like -5 star. The pho I order sucks!! I order large bowl and there is more noodle then the soup base. The noodle end up soaking Up all the soup base. The noodle was little hard. I only ate all the rare beef. Talking about bad service, rite when we sat down we told the server to let us have a min to look at menu. She came back every min asking us are we ready. Why was she rushing us? The place was empty!! Order viet ice coffee. When the coffee arrive, she just drop it on the table and almost spill the whole thing on me. I was like really? Why was she in such a hurry? No table here but us..i will never come back here. Lemon Grass is the best pho in Vegas so far. This place suck !!!"
1,"I finally got around to trying this place. It's nearby, but I always find myself at either Noodlehead, BRGR or Chipotle. My boyfriend's parents were in town so I wanted to take them someplace a little nicer. We went to Spoon last time they were in town, so we decided to give Dinette a try.\n\nWe arrived at 9:30pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was mostly empty, there were 3 other occupied tables in the entire restaurant. \n\nThey were out of 2 dishes that we were interested in, the salmon salad and one of the pizzas. We ended up ordering the following items:\n-Grilled Shishito Peppers: Came w/ goat cheese and fried almonds. Yummy! I would say this was my favorite dish, wish the size was larger. $9 for 7 small peppers, 5 chunks of cheese and 7 almonds. FYI, the peppers weren't spicy at all.\n-Butternut Squash Soup: I didn't try this but it smelled good. I was surprised at how small the portion was for $8.\n-Grilled Romaine Hearts: Again, I didn't try this but the boyfriend's parents each ordered their own, and they described the dish as having \""interesting flavors.\"" \n-Roasted Broccolini Pizza: Also had feta, olives, tomatoes and fresh mozarella. Meh. Very sparse toppings. Flavors didn't go together as well as I had hoped.\n-Chorizo Sausage Pizza: Also had tomatoes, and I forgot what else. Taste was slightly above average, but again, very sparse toppings. I think there were probably 7 or 8 very small pieces of sausage on the entire pizza.\n\nService was mediocre at best. The server was friendly but he was pretty absentminded...or maybe he just didn't care that much about doing a good job? He had to be flagged down to refill our water pitcher even though he had walked by our table and the restaurant was not busy, he poured water into my boyfriend's cup but not mines even though mines was empty, he brought us red pepper flakes for our pizza when we were halfway done w/ eating them, etc. Also, the cooks thanked another party for coming as they exited the door, but did not say one word to us...huge pet peeve of mines. We had still tipped 20%, but it was not deserved.\n\nI don't think we will be back, we will stick with Spoon next time we are looking for a nicer restaurant in the area."
3,"I typically don't like to spend $15 on a hamburger all that much, but when you are on the strip and are going to spend too much anyway, this place is a solid choice.  The hamburgers there are pretty damn good, and big!  The fries are bomb, but the onion rings did not impress.  They were batter rings it seemed:   too much batter and not enough onion."
4,"We really enjoyed VBGB's!  When you walk in there are two windows to right of the place to order your food. You are given a number and they bring you your order. Then you can order your drinks at the huge, beautiful bar (which has an ice shelf!).  I was expecting more of a sit-down type restaurant but this place was still pretty awesome. \n\nIt has a great vibe, quick and friendly service, not overly crowded, and the food is really good! We ordered the giant pretzel- the beer cheese is really good! I had the pork brat on the roll. I really enjoyed it, the roll was soft and not too hard or crunchy, like at some places.  My husband had the buffalo chicken tacos which were spicy and delicious.  Our friends ordered the fried pickle appetizer- they was really good too! They were chip not spear style.  The pickles had a light, crispy batter and had a bit of spice. \n\nI loved the ambiance of the place too, with hip music and decor. I love the overhead string lights as well.  This place was more biergarten-ish than I was expecting. They also have a back patio which could be fun come spring. \n\nI will definitelty be back to VBGB's next time I am in the area!"
3,"Fast Eddies is your typical diner! \n\nGreat fast food, great service, low prices! \n\nI am a big fan of their patty melt, and I love the crinkle cut fries! \n\nWe've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner and haven't had any bad experiences yet. \n\nThe decor is lacking, and scary and I feel like I am on the tilt-a-whirl but other then that, Eddies is good if you just want a good bite to eat with out any fuss."
0,"The restaurant was empty an hour after the football game. This is a bad sign. We waited 30 min for our food. Our food was cold. One member of our party did not receive his meal with the remainder of the group. When the group complained the server said \""the cook is new and is messing everything up.\""  We paid for our drinks and left. Worst service ever. Horrible food. Several other parties walked out as well. Do not waste your time. Walk across the street to Gordon Biersch."
0,"Great ambiance? My half blind grandmother could put together better low lighting with ikea lights than this place.  $11 cocktails with well alchohol? Do I look 15 to you, that you think I cant tell the difference between a plastic bottle of vodka and a vodka that should be in a cocktail that merits an $11 price tag?  I've been to many of the great \""cocktail\"" bars in many different cities (The Whistler in Chicago being the best).  Worst of all, we leave there after sitting in a corner booth on a not busy night, my girlfriend realizes she forgot her phone there and we return not 5 minutes later and the phone is mysteriously \""missing\"" yet the same lighter she had in her purse is sitting conveniently on the bar. right. I recommend never going to this place, I'm sure I could probably get a better drink in prison"
1,"Went in this Wed night to get away from the housemates. Was not in the most upbeat manner. Found the place boring. Football on all screens jukebox cut off. Bunch of old guys mostly. The rest were mostly fat couples getting wasted and guys with to much sideburns.\nThen a couple of brothers (black men) also old walked in wearing their throw back Shaft leather jackets. Totally weird crowd!\n\nThe bartender was a slim young woman that needs to go to bartending school. I watched her attempt to make cocktails with more than 2 ingredients. What a disaster! She over pours and under pours and added some ingredients like whiskey to what was suppose to be a long island!   Pours the largest straigt shoots I have ever seen and I tell you I have been to bars like in MT, WY, AK and New Orleans and not seen anything close to this size of a shoot!\n\nConsulted with some off duty guy on how to make 6 Kamikazes (ended up being 5 and she had to make another that end up being 2.5 drinks instead of 1) and together with a book they came up with a cranberry version because, get this they have no lime juice! What sorta bar in the SW opens its doors without LIMES or LIME JUICE?  The guy kept calling the drink Cosmos and I kept repeating I know the difference and the order was KAMIKAZES.  Then he brings me the book and is still pointing out Cosmos!  I verbally give the bartender the recipe for Kamikazes plus the variation for a blue one. Guy says you must make a lot of drinks! I say you want to hire me - I've got experience?\n\nI tell you if they want to keep the doors open they better get some help with bar and budget knowledge. The budget is being shoot by over pours and wrong pours and if the liquor control sees this they're certian to be busted/fined. Hey but the bartender knows how to wash glasses well so that was a relief to see.\n\nAnd it's true that drinks are about $4 though the sign says $5! LOL\nWhat an experience. I left confident in my bartending skills though I haven't poured in a month!"
2,"THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING BREAKFAST BURRITO -- The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my \""treats\"" I allow myself occasionally and I have enjoyed them for years at this location. Unfortunately over the last year or so, this amazingly sinful wrap of goodness has deteriorated into an OK breakfast burrito. Less cheese, less egg, less chorizo (more potatoes) and probably 30% smaller than before. I understand everybody's gotta make a buck, but I probably won't be spending mine there anymore."
4,"The best pizza I have had in a long time. Got the carnivore and a salad. I'm from the east coast and the pizza reminded me of the pizza back home, except better! The owner thanked us for coming when we left. I thought that was a nice touch. They are going to need a bigger building soon."
1,"Came here because of all the positive reviews, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there...The prices aren't as great as everyone seemed like it is...for prepared foods, I can go to Sunflower Market or Fresh and Easy, also Geri's Old Philadelphia at Pecos/Tropicana also sells a bunch of East Coast Favorites like Tastykake and Wise Chips and Drakes and stuff like that...Only thing that my mom would probably go to Glazier's for is pork roll...But living at Sandhill/Hacienda we have plenty of choices on where to go and can price compare and have plenty of stores with the same East Coast selection...Its good that the SW now has a choice other than the expensive VONS or the always-busy Wal-Mart..."
1,"I used to go here regularly, but stopped... the kid who works at the front desk is a pain. He says there are appointments available, then says there aren't. I went in for my appointment, waited 30 minutes and then when I asked him what was going on he had an attitude, I don't mind waiting when I'm a walk in, but not when I've made an appt days before. The girls do a good job... if you can get in and they're not busy because they're great, they're busy because they only have two girls working the whole place."
2,"Updating, since \""America\"" went above and beyond to resolve my customer service issue of not receiving the 10 percent locals discount, I am happy to revise my rating.\nAlways good to see a business respond so positively regarding customer satisfaction."
1,Delicious dive food but simply overpriced in my opinion. A trio shouldn't cost me $20 and that much attitude.\n\nFood:  7/10\nService:  4/10\nPrice:  3/10\nAtmosphere:  n/a
0,"I feel that I have a fairly extensive vocabulary, but I am truly struggling to find a word to express the level of horrible that this show was. My tickets were free, but I feel as though I should be compensated for my time. He does a song by Bill Clinton about Monica Lewinski. Does that give you an idea of how dated and stale this material is? He does 20 minutes of Jeff Foxworthy jokes. He launches into Larry the Cable guy and half the audience was howling, \""Git er Done.\"" Most of his impersonations sounded like bad Karaoke. I'm 30 and had no idea who half the people were. Most of the jokes were pain inducing puns. The rest of the show was a constant barrage of gay jokes. He also launched into a long bit about how he was praying to god how he could spend more time with his family and after him and his wife prayed and prayed, he got the Vegas gig. Then he launched into his own power ballad. Lots of people give tickets away to this, I would question is it's even worth free. You'd have more fun watching the displays on one of the slot machines and getting free drinks. I feel a little stupider for having seen this."
4,"Thanks to Yelp I found this little Thai place in a strip mall in Las Vegas.  It is some distance from the Strip, but it is worth the trip.  I have gone there both of the last two times I've visited Vegas.  Both times the food was inexpensive and delicious.  The woman who owns and runs the place keeps it spotlessly clean and is quite the character.  I highly recommend this place."
3,"I have seen every exhibit that has come through here in the last 5 years.  There are a few misses, but most are hits.  \nStart at the top and work your way down.  And don't forget to use the photobooth before you go.\nThe Weekend Factory is great for kids- the studio in the basement is open for visitors to make some art to take home with them."
0,"I always shop at Costco, but this location is the worst managed store that I have been to in the entire country.\n\nMeat Department:\nThe meat department is the absolute worst managed department in the store.\n-The counters are always empty and disorganized.\n-I always find expired meat and seafood on the counters that are far past their sell by date.\n-The manager of the meat department is extremely rude, as well as most of the staff behind the window.\n-They thaw out frozen seafood and raw seafood in the same sink at times.\n-They take the expired frozen seafood and thaw it out to sell as fresh seafood.\n-When they have the Seafood Road Show, they sell you the lobster tails frozen and it increases the price due to the extra water weight.\n-I have seen a meat cutter drop meat on the floor and then pick it up and continue to use it.\n-The stock on the counters are constantly being rearranged. There is no consistency as far as wear the meat and seafood are placed on the counter. \n\nBakery;\n-Absolutely disgusting. The baking trays are reused without ever being washed.\n-The wash machine is used continuously without the water being replaced with fresh water. This is a machine that recycles the water. When the trays and mixing bowls are not rinsed off and the water is not changed it just keeps washing with filthy water.\n-If you look at the three compartment sink it is always filled with filthy water, trays, and utensils.\n-The floors are always filthy as well as the counter tops and the storage areas.\n\nFruit & Vegetable Cooler / Friit & Vegetable Section.\n-The cooler is usually a mess and disorganized.\n-I always find expired veggies.\n\nDeli:\n-The deli always seems to be clean.\n-The manager and the staff are very helpful and friendly.\n-One thing I have a problem with is that they do not rinse the whole chickens off before they cook them in the rotisserie ovens.\n-I also don't like that they share the same walk in cooler with the meat department. There is always raw mets and cooked food near each other.\n\nFreezer Section:\n-The freezers always seem to be well stocked and organized.\n\nThe Food Isles & Other Shelves:\n-The shelves always seem to be well stocked and organized.\n\nTire Shop:\n-Good prices on tires and installation.\n-The staff is fairly quick and pleasant.\n\nFood Court:\n-The line is always too long.\n-There is no organized system for the customers to wait in line.\n-Everything they serve at the food court is inexpensive and tastes great!!\n\nRegisters:\n-As always at any Costco the people that work the registers are lightning fast. This company has the most efficient check out areas of any supermarket or big box store.\n\nGas Station:\n-Costco gas always seems to be about ten cents cheaper then all of the has stations in the area.\n\n********************************************************\nThe Costco return policy is unmatched by any of their competitors. The absolute best customer service when it comes to returns.\n\nCostco has a great online store. Especially when it comes to furnishing your home.\n\n********************************************************\n\nI love shopping at Costco, but avoid this locations meat department and bakery at all costs. Absolutely disgusting."
1,"Bought a season pass last season and was very disappointed. Went once this season on a free day which was nice of them. The water was still super cold but lines were sorter so we actually went down a couple slides. The wave pool is very mild compared to the one at cowabunga bay. Had a better time, but still not sold."
1,"Elliot's recently moved to the old Meadowview steakhouse location (much, much larger than the end of the strip mall where they used to be found, but still very close).\n\nI'm a fan of local, family-run business, especially ones that seem to be doing well.  If the business is doing well enough to move from the strip mall to the Meadowview, I'd say they are doing pretty well, so I'm excited.  Even though I ate their barbecue a few years ago and wasn't impressed, I figure it's time to try it again.\n\nWe went in on a Saturday afternoon, and the cavernous room was just about empty.  Seriously.  This huge room - outfitted to be reminiscent of the old building - had one other table with customers.  We spent probably ten minutes talking to the cashier and were not interrupted.  After we sat down, another couple came in.  That may not be a good sign.  But it's for another discussion.\n\nI decided that I would order a combo plate so that I could taste the barbecue and the brisket.  I've actually had brisket (in Texas, to be fair) that I loved, and I really would like to find someone in Charlotte who can do it justice, so I keep trying.\n\nThe brisket?  Nah.  It just isn't worth it, so don't bother.  The pulled pork is okay, but it doesn't have much flavor.  They do have some sauces that you can add, and they are okay, but nothing special.  The thing that really gets me is that their mac and cheese really has potential, it has consistency just like my grandmother used to make.  But again, it has no flavor.  It seems they used a bunch of actual cheese, rather than just using velveeta or something, but no mustard or anything else to give it flavor.  Shame, really.\n\nMaybe I'll check back again in another couple of years."

It is one of my favorite courses and it is at least semi affordable. \n\nThe greens were clean and run a little fast, but of course that is a good thing. There are a bunch of fun little par 3's, and for me more then enough long par 5's. It is a challenging course but even a beginner can have a good time there.\n\nThere is a little water scattered around the course and minimal desert spots. I really enjoy the course and it is well worth the drive."

4,"Awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good, fun night!! Walking in, this can be extremely deceiving. It's dark wood and somewhat old school. But it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner. Where the real fun comes is when you step out back. They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months  \n\nOverall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte."
1,I came to Scottsdale a few weeks ago.  One of the things I wanted to do is go to a Dunkin Donuts since I hadn't been there in years (when they were last in California).  We went to two different stores and the donuts weren't the same has I remembered.  The donut shop down the street from my home in California has better donuts than these two stores.  We did have the steak breakfast sandwich and coffee which were good but I just wasn't excited about the taste of the donuts I try ed.   The staff behind the counter wasn't friendly at either store.   I was so disappointed I kind of wished I hadn't gone there and keep my good memory of the great donuts I had years ago.
1,It's ok. Pretending to be the real St-viateur. but the bagels aren't as good. I'd give it a 2.5 if they would let me.
0,"Went here with the family for NYE dinner.  Food was half good and half horrible.  Kitchen closed and sent home all of the chefs (except the pastry chef) before we even had the plates delivered.  They should never have taken the reservation for a party of 14 at the end of the night.  They were running 40 mins behind and still seated us, but only to poorly execute the food and service. They didn't even have bread for the table or any of the entrees...this is an italian restaurant!  They finally brought us some frozen bread to try to appease us. It was still frozen in the middle.   If you are going to take a reservation at the end of the night, then you should make sure you have the right people there to execute at the level you should be for the type of restaurant you are. I live in NYC and have no problem paying higher prices for good food, but having to pay high prices for crappy food is just ridiculous.  Very disappointed and will never go back!"
3,"After our first visit this week, I think we've found our newest favorite pizza place! We've lived in our house for about 15 years and eat pizza 2-4 times a month. We had never heard of this place. We were in the mood for some 'za and decided to look online for something different from our usual haunts. A Yahoo search turned up this place just to the edge of the map. The attached Yahoo reviews looked promising and a quick look at Yelp sealed the deal. We decided to give it a shot. \n\nI'm ecstatic! As long as they're consistent (except for below), this is our new place! Keep up the good work Lucky's. We're lucky to have found you! \n\n-1 star = Our wings were overcooked (making them tough) but the sauce made them very tolerable! Definitely not a deal breaker!"
0,"We were also one of the customers who used the restaurant.com coupon. I had been to this place once before and thought it ok enough to return. Both myself and my daughter love salmon sashimi so we ordered it as usual. What they placed on our table was NOT salmon sashimi. It had the look and texture of smoked salmon. We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water. Not one single person on the staff... who by the way weren't doing anything but talking behind the counter, made an attempt to offer us a towel to wipe it from the table or the floor. We tried to get their attention but they ignored us. We finally got up and grabbed towels to clean it up... only when we did this did they take notice. \n\nI will never go back to this place."
2,"I'm not a huge fan of Firehouse, but somehow, every time we're in Old Town, we end up there.  They have a huge patio, and indoor dance floor, a game of bags outside and they have a lounge area just inside the doors.  I've only been here during the nightclub hours (9pm-2am).  It's good for the young and single people, but if you're attached and over the club scene, don't go here.  I'm just not into shouting to the person right next to me, because the music is so loud (the patio is not so loud though)."
4,"I really liked this place! You go in and the server is exceptionally nice. He suggested a dish he said would be spicy but it was slightly mild but very flavorful. They use Lemon Grass sticks as the \""bone\"". This place actually rivals my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Portland. The price is right and the food is great! If you're considering not going...GO! Don't be scared off by the ghetto neighborhood and trashy strip mall. This place is a diamond in the rough."
0,"This place is absolutely terrible, what a disappointing end to an otherwise lovely afternoon up on Mount Washington. Coffee was expensive, tasted awful, and the server seemed a little off - not rude, just off. A 3+ dollar \""homemade\"" pastry tasted like a Little Debbie cake. Will never come back here."
3,Pretty good homemade bread products.  We stopped by for lunch and had the chicken salad which was decent.
3,"I found them on my insurances website and decided to take my son there. It is conveniently located on Robindale and Rainbow and is only a few minutes away from our home. When you walk into the office, you are walking into a frames showroom. They have both sides of the lobby and a little island with frames inside the cases. They have a good selection of glasses and depending on what kind of lens you need, they might have them in stock.\n\nThe first part of the appointment was her assistance conducting a eye test with my son. She used three different machines to check his vision and the other was to check the pressure on his eye. The last test was to take a picture of the back of his eye. This was not covered by my insurance and we had to pay $35 for this test. I guess she could have done it manually but thought I have them take a pic of his eye instead. I am glad that they did cause she was able to show me what was going on and now we have to see a specialist for a second opinion. OK so the visit with Dr. Gutierrez. She is a very pleasant doctor. She new her stuff and took the time to break things down so that I could understand what was going on with my sons eye. She was very thorough and she is the one who recommended that we get a second opinion on her findings.\n\nShe gets my seal of approval and I recommend her to anyone looking for a new eye doctor."
3,"Absolutely amazing view.  The place is gorgeous and the food was delicious.  Waiters were extremely polite, and they bring you complimentary tasting samples for free--bruschetta and truffles!\n\nHad the grand marnier souffle--heaven.\n\nPrices were high (around $45 for a typical entree that doesn't include any sides), but it was definitely expected for a place like this."
2,We chose the signature sandwich and it was tasty.
4,"The butterfish tataki, salmon sashimi, and pork belly with Kim chi is delicious! pineapple flavored Shochu is yummy"
1,Food was so bland. Everything was cooked really well and great portion sizes but overall the food was kinda flavorless.
3,"Went here with my boyfriend on a Thursday [5.27] & heard about this place from my coworkers about a month earlier. It was a bit of a drive for me, but hey~ they're open until 1am! Definitely worth the drive because this place is going green & sell local art that they have as decor :) They also have a flat screen tv by one entrance & a lounge/couch area right by the restroom by the other entrance.\n\nI wanted to try the mango or honeydew boba, but the server said that they were powdered flavors :/ I ended up getting the green milk tea with boba & that worked just fine.\n\nI ordered Kiki's burger; sauteed shitake with mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili with aioli on the side. This burger was awesome~ everything about the description made it sound great, & it was! The buns for the burgers are sweet, definitely a good size portion because all of my buddies know that I'm a slow eater.\n\nI ate half of the burger to save room for dessert; Portuguese donuts that had Vietnamese cinnamon & coffee gelato. This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9 \n\nThe service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server. I know she wasn't knowledgeable about some of the questions we had about the menu, but it's totally understandable because I know that they're training for success! This place is doing great so far & I know that they will open one soon on the southwest area! *nudge nudge :)"
1,"We got the general admissions seats, and even though there were seat numbers on the tickets, we were told that seating would be first come, first served. We ended up sitting in the very last row of the small theater (in a casino that was in major need of an update to the twenty first century). The seats were not raised, so we couldn't see anything to begin with. The show itself was on a stage, and not broadcast on the two screens mounted on the walls, even though it looked like there was a capability of doing so. The stunts were pretty average, and there was so much provocative dancing involved that I want sure what I had paid too watch. Not really family friendly. The interesting illusions are few and far apart. If not for the dancing, it would be fun to take kids to."
1,"It seems to me like the quality of this place is rapidly declining.  The service has always been slow, and now it has slowed down to the point where you actually are forgotten.  The last time I went, my friend and I were told they didn't have a drink list.  I ordered a martini from the old drink list, and it was nothing like the previous 30 French Martinis I've had @ Momo.  The quality of the food has also taken a serious hit.  First, the chocolate gooey dessert somehow became an overcooked brownie with Hershey's syrup on top.  The pizza used to be delightful - just the right size to share with a friend, with a lovely homemadey crust.  Now you get something that appears to have been on sale in the freezer department at the local grocery store.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but this place is too dark.  I get a headache from squinting at my friends while I'm there.  I appreciate mood lighting, but Momo is so dark I wonder if maybe they don't pay their electricity bills.  The wine list is pretty good, and it can be fun to see bands there, but those alone aren't enough to keep me coming back like I used to."
1,"My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday. I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food. The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price. However, our waiter was extremely rude. He acted like it was a burden to serve us. I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter. I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time. It made the entire experience quite disappointing."
3,"Very good restaurant and staff. Low prices and moderate, sensible size portions. Veal chop was great."
2,"An okay bakery, but is it a five star lunch spot? No. True to its confectionary specialties, the food here is sweet- and I mean everything is sweet. The sticky sweet croissants, the salads that are peppered with honey and candied nuts, the pita sandwiches that are oddly stuffed with whole oranges (pith and all) and sweet pickle, even the simple vegetable soup that overwhelmingly tasted like sweet potatoes and allspice- absolutely every dish served to us here incorporated fruits or honey, transmogrifying a savory lunch into a toothache inducing sugar fest. I can understand how the sweet-savory thing can appeal to some people (like, I don't know, pre-diabetics and your typical Waldorf salad eating American sugar addict), but I can't stand it. The staff is extremely friendly and well-acquainted with their sacrosanct Yelp referrals; in fact, they're almost too friendly... like guilt you into writing a good review for some free baklava friendly. Further, to my understanding, the only thing organic here is the wheat flour they use in their breads- big deal? Nothing that I love about Mediterranean food came through here - the sumac, the pungent garlic, the lamb, the kebabs, the fresh roasted vegetables... you won't find any of it here. Overall, an average bakery (the baklava and pinwheels were good- but I'm not orgasmic over them), but lunch? Eh..."
4,"ABC stores are mainly from Hawaii but have found there way to the mainland of the United States. This is a great place to buy cheap drinks and food then the overpriced stores inside the hotels and I think this gives the tourists some advantage to save some money and not everyone in Vegas knows about these ABC stores. Friendly services and well stocked store with great deals and friendly staff that are mostly Asian.\n\nI always come for the 1 liter bottled water, tall cans of beer and sometimes six pack and some snacks to go along with the beer. The Cigarettes here are cheaper compared to the ones in the casino and they have great souvenirs to bring back home that won't break the bank."
1,"My regular Togo place when I feel lazy at home, the food is great but make sure u check the order before u take it back home especially the busy hour! ;( they miss one of my main course n I need to go back n get it@@ no my idea lazy Togo day, I guess .."
3,"Almost a year to the first time we visited Razz's, we went back in company with another couple.  Stellar meal.  DH and I shared an appy of squash blossom stuffed with cheese, lobster and crab.  Absolutely delish and it was brought to our table already on separate plates, so DH and I did not have to pass the small appetizer plate back and forth for bites. Very thoughtful.  Our DC's got a spicy Indonesian noodle bowl called something like Bai Mai Goreng or something---who cares?  Our friend was kind enough to share a bite and it was outstanding.  Could easily have eaten a bowl of it as an entree.  And speaking of entrees,  And speaking of entrees---we two ladies got the duck breast  with lingonberry sauce and a  house blend farro.  Duck was cooked perfectly, just a hint of pinkness and not a bit dry an the fat beautifully rendered.  I didn't love the farro---a bit crunch for me---but my fellow duck-eater loved her's!  The gentlemen, respectively, got the chicken scalloppini and the steak special, and there were a lot of groans of delight emitting from that end of the table.  The art on the walls is remains kind of weird, but still a lovely, intimate ambiance and our service was quite good,  Razz's definitely will remain on our \""re-visit\"" list!"
2,"Something within me has changed over the last few years, the need for overtly large portions of heart stopping food has died down. The food is not bad, but there is nothing extremely special about it either. I resisted the urge to order the sage fried chicken with bacon waffles in a vain attempt of sparring myself the unbearable guilt which would follow, but ordering anything on the menu is bound to lead to that anyways. \n\nI went there with a friend to catch up after being away for some time. This location was completely dead. I have been to the one on Sahara a few times before and waited for more than 30 minutes. The hostess was very polite and asked if we had a preference for a booth or table. We chose a booth and sat by ourselves. Maybe everyone else was on the other side, but it felt like a ghost town. The bus-person came around to take our drink orders in a timely fashion. The waitress then came by to take our orders. I was not ready yet, because I was still trying to find something that wouldn't give me a heart attack, but those bacon waffles kept taunting me. I am a sucker for salty and sweet. \n\nIn the end I ordered the bacon, swiss, and avocado scramble with crispy potatoes. I will not lie, everything on my plate was decent, just not spectacular. The scramble itself was fluffy with cheese oozing out. The bacon gave it a little saltiness from the otherwise bland combination. The avocado was sparse compared to the generous helping of everything else on the plate. The potatoes were my favorite part. Usually I can do without all the extra carbs, but these were fried crispy with the center not being dried out which was then tossed with some diced red onions. \n\nThe waitress left us alone for the most part and just peeked in every once in a while to see if we were ok. It is worth a try, if you have never been before, but I will continue on my food odyssey for the best breakfast in Vegas."
1,"In an age when people spend too much time on digital devices...comes a restaurant that forces you to order on iPads.  \n\nSo I ordered on the iPad, but they lost my order.  Then they said they would take care of it right away...And I waited another 25 minutes...And got still nothing.  So I walked out.  They seemed really discombobulated, but maybe it's because they are new.\n\nMy wife has had better success getting food delivered when she tried a few weeks later.  It's ok \""healthy food\"" for Vegas, but sub-par for other cities like LA, NY, SF, CHI, etc."
4,"Highly recommend this place. AWESOME customer service. They fixed my shattered iPad screen in one day. I bought an Otterbox cover for the iPad, hated it, brought it back two weeks later and they exchanged it for a Survivor ... No questions asked.  Love to support local Tempe and these guys are the best."
1,"Traveling from PHX to Chicago Midway on 11/29/14 via Southwest and my 70 year old Aunt & Uncle's luggage was sent on an earlier flight. They arrived at PHX airport at 9:30am for their 1:00pm flight and their luggage went on the wrong flight (it went on the 11:30 flight). \nWhen it arrived at Chicago's Midway Airport we were told it would be  held for them at baggage claim 7 and would be secured and locked. Upon their arrival at midnight, it was NOT secured or locked up. WHY did go on the wrong flight? Why did Southwest overbook the flight causing 2 senior citizens to be bumped off their flight???? They arrived in Chicago 8-9 hours LATE!"
1,"I have been coming here for years and was a little saddened when the previous owner sold up and moved on. However the place was spruced up and new deli items were offered a few years back. For one reason or another it was quite some time till I managed to get back. \n\nI have visited several times for coffees over the years and pop in ever few weeks/months for a pizza slice as this is the only place I can find that sells these inside out school pi\\zza slices (base/cheese/sauce). I gave up on the other deli offerings some time ago, due to various bad cheese experiences etc.\n\nEach time I have the same issue. The staff really don't seem to have a clue about the products they sell or how the work flow behind the counter needs to work. it took 20 minutes for the couple in front of me to be served and for me to pay for a pizza slice and a quiche. This also somehow tied up all 3 staff for each transaction...mmm. Every time I am in there seems to be new staff, previously it was the same staff for years and years. I think this may be where some of the problems lie. \n\nOkay for a coffee if you not in a rush, but many of the food items are expensive and seem a little past their best on occasion. Staff really don't seem to know about the products or the service they are delivering.  \n\nThe good points \n\n- Pizza slice\n- Potatoe Salad\n- Quiche / Spanish Tortilla\n- Sit outside over looking the meadows\n- The coffee\n- Nice clean, well laid out shop\n\nThe Bad Points\n\n- The service, it is slllloooowwww\n- The staff don't seem to understand what they are selling and how the till works.\n- My missus is veggie and ended up with a quiche Loraine rather than the tomato/pesto one on the signage. Veggies and bacon don't mix well. ;D"
1,"i hate chasers, and it has nothing to do with being kicked out at a show and then having to drive all the way to flagstaff the night after to see the show i wanted to see. fuckers.\n\ni have had to argue with bar staff about mixed drinks they made wrong.\n\ni'm not a huge fan of whiskey sours. but look..they should be sour.\n\nshe tastes it, no thats right..\ni say, no..it's not.\nshe pours sour mix out of the bar gun thingy, hmmm. sour mix is out..its just pumping water.\n\nno shit...\n\n/rant\n\nstage and sound are not really my thing, i kind of like the stage to be at least 4 feet above ground level.  but whatever. i'll leave the getting thrown out story to offline chat. lol."
2,"stopped in for brunch on saturday with my mum auntie and grandma\nno complaints really, its a decent place. the lasagna and chicken marsala werent bad. my favorite was probably the minnestrone however, i wish i'd just gotten a huge ass bowl of that. I think my favorite aspect of this place is the retro furniture, really big chairs covered in...felt? i guess? whatever, they're colorful and funky, theres an old trolley car inside the building. overall this is a good family style restaurant, and apparently its been there for ages. i'd go back, but probably only with the famz, and probably only to try their pasta w/ mizithra cheese and browned butter. definitely A-Ok."
0,"This is not going to be a fair review. Upfront.\n\nI visited the Margaritaville Cafe on 2/14/11. Apparently someone had \""bought-out\"" the first two floors leaving only the roof-top bar available.\n\nThe line for the roof-top bar started at the top of the stairs and proceed down a hall toward what appeared to be a bus area/kitchen. The stench of stewing garbage in the hallway was over powering. About 20-30 people waited in this line. After 15 minutes, the line didn't move and the same two guys at the front were still there.\n\nWe left. Probably never coming back. Management needed to be doing some damage control and wasn't. It probably would have been tolerable if someone tried to get a couple of drink orders for the line."
4,"by far the BEST thai food i've ever had. it brings shame to any thai bbq and sanamluang locations. the food screams authenticity and different flavors associated with thai cooking - yes, there is more than lemon grass, coconut milk, and curry powder! there are levels of spiciness and the owner is a connoisseur of german white wines. he can match any dish with the right wine. how superb! just make sure you know what you are asking for when you ask for \""spicy\"". dinner is the best deal. for lunch, there is a buffet, however, it rids of the entire atmosphere. (if you want a buffet in vegas, eat at the rio!) there are tons and tons of items to try- all the more reason to come back. i think we ordered about 7-8 dishes and paid a little over 100, including tax and tip. we were only a party of 3! now that is good dining!\r\n\r\nthe location and the setting isnt what you would expect of the restuarant. it's off the strip (which is a good and bad thing), located in a plaza. just dont judge a book by its cover. come hungry and talk to the owner if he's there. he's a really nice guy!"
0,"Kitchen is great but watch out for the bar.  They only comp your drinks if you LOSE.  James Aguilar, (manager) NOT customer friendly, does NOT give a crap about locals.\nCame in here with my husband whom was gambling a little. Ate, played pool... ZERO beers comped.. We only hoped for one to be comped, but these guys were totally hard up.\nApparently PTs is hurtin for money if they won't comp ONE draft beer.\nNever going back.\nAlso put $5 in the juke box.\n\nWe are all around good patrons usually, but not used to the \""you don't lose enough here\"" motto.  Weird vibe. \nTake my advice... Go across the street to Eureka Casino.. Barry and Grace are so nice, and Fat Choy has a better menu."
2,"This is a great store: Clean and a good variety of vegetables. The vitiamins and nutrition items are fresh and priced well. \n\nToday I did not receive the wheat germ I paid for, so if you go in, watch the bagger, because I saw him place the wheat germ in a plastic bag with another item.I brought cloth bags, he gave me the first item to put in the cloth bag, but failed to give me the wheat germ. Unfortunately I am not the type that calls back to get my missing item, so I'm out the money. Next time I'll keep a better eye on my purchases."
2,"I'm on my \""Showgirls\"" diet which includes brown rice, vegetable and evian. Surprisingly, I got all of that at Neo Tokyo, with some chicken as well. \nWe stopped by for lunch, and enjoyed fresh food at a very decent price. The lunch special was $6.50 and came with a spring roll. The guy working was friendly and offered some recommendations. \n\nI don't hang out in this part of town much, but if I'm in that part of town in the near future, I'd stop by here again without a doubt."
4,"This restaurant by far surpassed our expectations! We had the best service and food we've ever eaten at any restaurant.\n\nWe tried several appetizers including the gnocchi, stuffed lobster tail (which had lentils in bisque and it was phenomenal), pork belly, and beef tartar which comes out with garlic potato chips and was to die for!! \n\nFor dinner I had the beef Wellington and my husband had the american beef rib cap. The rib cap has marbling throughout so it was pretty rich, tasted fabulous!! The beef Wellington didn't disappoint, so much flavor!! Be prepared though, it does have a longer preparation time. For accompaniments we had the sauteed mushrooms (divine), Brussel sprouts, and Mac n cheese. My husband said the brussel sprouts were very tasty and the mushrooms were as well. The Mac n cheese was good, just a little heavy on the truffle.\n\nDessert had always been my favorite meal, so we had to sample a few. By far the sticky toffee pudding with caramel ice cream is the best dessert I've ever had!! It's worth the entire trip!! We also had the apple tart tatin which comes out nice and hot and the waiter places the wonderful cinnamon ice cream on top so it's served a la mode. The cinnamon ice cream is so smooth and delicious!! My husband is a peanut butter lover so he tried the peanut butter bar which he said was his favorite.\n\nOur service was phenomenal!! We had Matthew and Derrick as our servers. They were extremely attentive and were always there before we even realized we needed anything. Matthew was also very good in knowing the menu and made some recommendations for us. \n\nBy far this is one of the best restaurants in town!!"
0,"Sub par food. Waiting time is terrible, didn't get drinks for 30 min and food for like 1 1/2 hours. Just cause there's a party going on doesn't mean you ignore your other customers"
2,Pretty good burgers. A bit pricey but on par with other airport eateries. Service was kind of lacking.
3,"I like Radio Maria. The ambience is nice, the waiters/owners are friendly, and I like their drinks and food. I recently went this past week, and snacked on hummus with roasted veggies and pita, patatas, and cheescake. The hummus is sooo good- and they serve it with toasted pita. The patatas were just okay, but I'm pretty sure I burnt off all of my tastebuds when I tried them, so that may be why I can't give them a decent description. The cheesecake was delicious. I drank orange frescas, and did a lemon drop shot. It was very good- I was w. a group of about 10 people, and the service was speedy and friendly. Please please go here over Boltini- much less pretentious."
3,"I only ever really go there for the movies, but I have to say, I love it for a few reasons:\n\n1.  Newer and cleaner than most others I've been to\n2.  Better ventilation - walking through the casino to get to the movie theater doesn't mean lungs full of smoke for my kids and me.  Most other local casinos, you just get slapped in the face with the smoke as soon as you walk in. For me = instant migraine.  Not at Aliante.\n3.  I left my credit card in the movie theater ladies room once and didn't realize until a couple of hours after I left.  I called, and someone from the staff had found it and turned it in.  MAJOR POINTS for HONESTY!  I will never forget how helpful the movie theater manager was.\n4.  Easier to find your way around.  I get lost in almost every casino I go to, but this one's simple to navigate."
0,"You can rename and put lipstick on a Pig, but the fact is its still a PIG. Look at the 600+ reviews on their previous business page for The Quad Las Vegas Resort & Casino. It tells the story. They may have remodeled part of it but the fact is their management team is less than stellar and their housekeeping is atrocious. Watch out for unadvertised extra fees and credit card hold charges without advanced authorization. Its one thing if they actually cared and tried to learn from reviews and customer complaints but the fact is they just dont care. If negative reviews existed, this hotel would be the poster child..."
1,"Tried to come here for lunch today. Sign advertised 5.95 lunch and I work right across the street, so I thought what the heck... \""it can't be that bad.\"" Well we will never know cause they were closed for lunch. No sign, no explanation, just flat out locked doors. Unacceptable.\n\nThe only reason this place gets two stars is they offer free chips and salsa with check-in. Fun fact, 94% of mexican restaurants already offer free chips and salsa."
2,"What makes this place stand out is that the Valero gas station is part of this mini mart and diner (I don't know if you'd really consider it a diner). It's a great pit stop if you're on the road, need to get gas, stop at a restroom, and grab a snack. Which is usually why I'm here on my way to UT from CA. I like that the restrooms are indoors, and fairly clean."
1,"We used to love the place because it is one of the few places that you can get paella in Champaign. However, last night when we were there, the rice of the paella we ordered is not fully cooked. It was stiff and hard to chew. Although they sent it back to re-cook, the rice still comes back partially done. We ended up canceling the order. This is unbelievable. It seems that they cannot manage to get the rice cooked and the chef failed to solve the problem! We were very disappointed at the paella and will definitely not come back to the restaurant again!"
0,"I've never had such a heartbreaking experience in my life with any store/restaurant/customer service establishment.  I'm not even a yelp kind of person, but I'm writing this review, my first ever, in hopes I save even one person from the stress this store has put on me.\n\nI'm my best friend's maid of honor and she chose to purchase her wedding dress and have her bridesmaids buy their dresses through this store.  It just so happens that my brother is also getting married, and using the same bridesmaid dress designer as my friend, so I figured I could kill two birds with one stone and order both dresses through Lillian Lottie.  From the beginning my experience was horrible.  Though there were a few saleswomen who were quite kind and competent over the phone (I do not live in Phoenix, so my transactions were all over the phone), the majority have no idea what they are doing.  Most times I called I would be put on hold til I was eventually hung up on, put through to the wrong person, or told that the salesperson was unavailable and would return my call. (Obviously I understand that a client in store is more important than a phonecall, so returning my call seems totally reasonable. But she never took down my name/number.  ...That info is kind of essential to return a call, isn't it?)\n\nNext problem: the ordering of the dresses.  I will spare the long-winded details of this next part, but in a nutshell, my dresses were both tremendously too large.  I understand that bridal sizes are different than street clothes, but considering the fact that my measurements were sent to them from a tailor, and that the designer of the dress had a website that said my measurements should have equalled a 10, I found it quite odd that they were insisting on my purchasing a 14.  Listening to the woman on the phone, I agreed.  Huge mistake.  The dresses showed up at my door and when I tried them on I looked like a lady on the cover of People magazine wearing her clothes after she had lost 100lbs.  I called Lillian Lottie devastated begging for a return and reorder, and they said it was too late, there was nothing they could do, and that they stood by their size chart. The designer couldn't possibly make a new one in time. \nTurns out every single other bridesmaid had the same issue with their dresses. (Though none as severe as mine, and unfortunately none of them had purchased TWO dresses.) After much stress on the sweet bride (who eventually removed her purchased wedding dress from Lillian Lottie and took it to be tailored at another place... oh, did I mention they originally ordered her the wrong dress? I suppose I will save that for her yelp post...) we managed to get a little bit of money back from Lillian Lottie for the alterations.  They even admitted that they messed up with my sizes specifically.  So I took the two dresses to a local, well-respected tailor and awaited the alterations.  Today I picked up my dresses...\n\n...They look horrible. The tailor did a beautiful job working with what she could.  She basically had to recreate the two gowns, but there was nothing much she could do... they look like completely different dresses.  I'm so upset with Lillian Lottie because rather than just admitting from the beginning that they may have miscalculated sizing they could have returned the dresses to the designer and get a smaller size.  Instead they were too bent on being \""right\"" and said there wouldn't have been enough time.  (I even contacted a higher up from the actual dress designer, and they were appalled that Lillian Lottie claimed it couldn't be done at the time this first issue with Lillian Lottie occurred.)\n\nMy best friend's wedding next week.  The dress looks disgusting, but it is what it is.  My brother's wedding is in October, so I'm hoping I can work with the designer and figure something out.  It may seem odd that though this debacle has been going on for several months, that I'm only posting this now.  However picking the dresses up from the tailor today and looking at the dresses hanging next to me right now,  knowing that it is over $500 worth of dresses that I will never wear again is enraging.  They should pay for both of these dresses.  But they won't.  They have my money and I'm out of their hair, so why would they?  So basically I'm writing this post to warn you ladies out there... do not shop at this establishment.\n\nWorst part is I'm engaged. I'm having a humongous wedding in Phoenix in May.  I have yet to buy my dress or choose the bridesmaids dresses.  Not only will I be taking my business elsewhere, I will make it a priority to inform any one I can to never shop at this place.\n\nTo Lillian Lottie:  I expected more. You seemed to have class.  Sadly, I was proven otherwise and unfortunately I'm the only one suffering from it.  Two dresses and over $500 down the drain.  And please don't respond with a snarky comment, Lillian Lottie, why I'm wrong and you're right.  I've noticed you do that, and it's unbecoming."
4,"I have been a resident here since 2007, after having a expensive and horrid mistake with the Las Palmas apartments on the eastside.  I very much enjoy living in this complex...my neighbours are nice, they recently renovated, the maintenance comes in a timely fashion, the leasing office calls and makes sure you are satisfied with whatever maintenance issues have occured, the units are clean and relatively pest free (unlike the Las Palmas, which has a cockaroach problem to this day!) I have never really had a complaint, other than some persons parking in my stall or leaving beer bottles, cans or fast food containers around my parking stall. Which I don't blame my management for, but the inconsiderate indviduals who could just about be anyone.  Also, might i add, that they are considerate when you have pets...if maintenance or the exterminators might have to come in."
2,"I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't tink they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live. \n\nI also like supporting local Arizona business.\n\nThe staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff."
3,"I had been wanting to try Culinary Dropout for a good while, last night the opportunity finally struck and I was not let down. Kristen and I went with our three favorite couples to celebrate an engagement, we decided to arrive at six thirty because they do not take reservations (I will never understand why restaurants choose to not accept them). Once seventy five percent of your party is there you get a little buzzer and your name on the list. \n      We found our friends sitting at the outside bar and joined them for some drinks. The bar is pretty awesome, there were several bartenders, so you never needed more than a little eye contact for quick service, and they have a ton of beers and specialty cocktails on the menu, from fruity and sweet to harsh and alocoholy. The seats were fairly plentiful and comfy, and there are also lounge seats all around the bar area for the outside dining, I thought the layout and design was attractive and used the limited space wisely, I'd love to come back for an outside lunch. The bartenders and waiters were friendly and attentive, all good looking (of course, Scottsdale) and all of our drinks (from beers to martinis to fruity stuff) were delicious and not too overpriced, I mean, they were overpriced, but not quite Scottsdale overpriced. So far, so good. We paid the tab and headed inside. \n      The atmosphere inside is awesome. I hope to someday open a restaurant, so when I enter a new business I eat it up, I devour the place, I pick apart the ambiance, the lighting, the noise level, the architecture and design, everything, and I really like Culinary Dropout. The tables are huge, slabs of hard, rough wood, very rustic and western, it is dimly lit with modern (not too loud) music playing, there is a surprising amount of room and lots of space for big party's, they have a stage for live music (awesome), Culinary Dropout really surprised me. \n      I will spare critiquing each meal and just stick with Kristen and I's, but just to be fair, two in our group had the beer battered fish and chips, one had the pub burger, one had the fried chicken and two had the shaved prime rib dip, and none complained. \n      Our group shared both the house potato chips, which were very tasty and fried just right, and the onion dip was flavorful, not some run of the mill dip, and the soft pretzel and provolone fondue, which was fantastic. A pretzel is kind of a pretzel, they were good, soft and all, but the provolone sauce simply exploded, man it was good, creamy and tasty, you should definitely try it. I ordered the fried chicken, which was delectable, it had a great but not overdone crunch, it was sweet and you could actually taste the spices, not just the taste of the fryer, you also get a lot of it, three big, juicy, tender pieces. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which was good enough, nothing special, but only had two bites in it, and two very small but scrumptious biscuits with honey. Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine, a little disappointing I guess, just not much meat, the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking, and it came with fries which were very good. If you're really in the mood for a prime rib sandwich, head to Houston's. \n      I will be back here for sure. I paid for Kristen and I, plus the newly engaged couple, and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars, that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff. It also only took us about an hour to get seated, eight people on a Friday night in Scottsdale with no reservations? How can you beat that. Culinary Dropout is simply awesome."
0,"If I could give them zero stars I would. Worst customer service experience of my life. They completely defrauded me. I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with). Clearly, she went in the back and put a hole in it herself. Maybe this is how the corporate Gucci office tries to eliminate exchanges and returns."
2,An attempt at a NY slice. I have eaten here a few times and all in all a three star attempt. Not a bad attempt but still not NY. Why is it so hard to make a good NY pizza here? Everyone uses bottled and/or shipped water anyway. This issue continues to allude me. The staff was great--- 4 stars for that.
4,"We took the greyhound to Montreal and was looking for brunch places near the station. This place has a great selection of food, from Egg Benedict to Crepe/Waffles. Most of their service staff only speak french and the menu is in french, this can be inconvenient but could also be part of the great experience!"
0,"SERIOUSLY?!?!  Bill goes up 7 bucks without notice?!?!?  the only reason COX is still in business is that there is no other option. \n\nIf they dont drop my bill, ive got to find another option out of principle alone."
3,What a gem! The best part is that they rent any of their fabulous items for one night for just $15. Gorgeous costume jewelry and unique items.
1,"We went there twice last week and had 2 different experiences as a hotel guest in the Carefree resort.  Monday night dinner. Fine, better than fine. Good service, good food and it was quiet, not many patrons so we were well taken care of.....no complaints.\n\nThursday morning breakfast. Terrible. \nThey were expecting a large group to come in but we were ahead of the group by 5 minutes and the first guests in. No-one brought us any water (until after we finished breakfast) despite being the only people in the restaurant for 5 whole minutes.\n\nThe menu was cancelled and we had a buffet due to the large group I presume. This would be okay but the buffet was really poor. It felt like the food was made hours ago and reheated. Fruit wasn't particularly fresh.\nThe tip was included on the check. We cant figure out for what as we received no water, we got our own food and yet they included a service charge of TWENTY PERCENT, not 15, but 20. That took some cheek.  We didnt contest it , too much effort. We'd rather just report it here and hope someone reads it and decides against going. That was a truly awful breakfast.\n\nI tend to leave very positive reviews when I make the effort to actually do this but this was a really big letdown. I couldn't recommend this place to anyone."
0,This is a review of the snack bar area. I love Target but the snack bar area is a freakin dump! Every single table right now is filthy and doesn't look like they have been cleaned all day. Gross...and they aren't even busy. I wish the health dist would pay thus slop hiuse a visit.
4,"Our server, Kai was awesome! I'm totally recommending this place to all my friends. Chef paco even came out and introduced himself to us! This place rocks!"
3,This is one of our favorite places to go as a family.  The food and atmosphere are great.
4,"This IS NOT shaved ice!  This is a regular outing for our family during summer.  When this closes in the end of September, it is a very sad time."
3,"The guys who work here are great.  They are friendly, professional and know their stuff.  Travis, I believe, is the store manager and is very knowledgeable about their merchandise.  I came in to purchase my iphone 6 and my phone arrived more than a week earlier than scheduled.  The transaction was flawless.  They didn't try to \""push\"" me to buy anything else (as others have written).  I'd definitely come back again if I needed to."
3,"Big airport with long taxis into your gate if you're unlucky (which I was).  Surly TSA folks who don't like the human phlegm cavorting through their airport.  That's the bad.  The good?  People watching equals a 10+ for sure!  Warmer than Cincinnati in the winter (that was easy).  Fun to fly in at night as you can see Vegas' lights screaming at you in the middle of all that blackness from at least 100 miles out, and that's a once in a lifetime experience (or is it?)  \n\nSo very many droopy heads inside this airport though!  Looks like a lot of you flyers have a case of the Mondays!  Extraordinary numbers and degrees of those pesky hangovers are apparent at this airport.  Side note: I've never seen so many women, young and old, go through an airport in velvet pajama bottoms.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, just a Vegas anomaly I suppose....\n\nWhy in the name of God would I give Las Vegas International McCarron Airport 4 stars? Slot machines everywhere, at every terminal food court and even randomly placed in otherwise nondescript terminal walkways!  Screw USA Today and a Starbucks latte at 515 AM, let's hit some more slots, people!"
3,"Mabels feels almost like a speakeasy; some forgotten 1920s haunt, dimly lit and awkwardly tucked away off of the main drag in Old Town Scottsdale. It is run efficiently by capable, friendly staff who genuinely enjoy chef Aaron May's fun cooking and who know how to pour a drink.\n\nUp until this point in your life, you've likely never tried a deviled egg burger: a burger lovingly prepared with a smattering of delicious deviled egg, with a perfect bit of cheese all on a wonderful english muffin of sorts. This simple fact needs to be remedied: try one at your earliest convenience.\n\nIt will get everywhere, as the burger is too big for its britches, and the deviling helps not a bit with cleanliness, but the flavor is fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail brings about a very few (four, I believe, in my case) enormous shrimp, but at roughly $2.25 a pop, I don't think I'd repeat, though the cocktail sauce is delightfully prepared and the shrimp are as big as your fist.\n\nThe bar is wonderful and eccentric, and on Tuesdays, you can attempt to stump Chef May. Though I haven't tried yet, it sounds like a world of fun in its own right. Better still, they pour heavy, which is good as the cocktails can run in the $7-$14 range.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is subdued; you almost hope it'll be smoky each time you walk in. The stamped tin roof is fun and the penny-floor is a quirky touch in the men's bathroom. And don't forget to ask about Moby Dick. \n\nA good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu, but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks. The happy hour, though frustratingly placed in the middle of the work week, is an amazing deal and I might just have to try to convince the office to abscond one Thursday."
4,If u don't what to travel to shady side walnut street Starbucks go to the one in east liberty. You will have the same great feeling. I been going there since it first open it's doors. But I do still go to the mama and pa coffee houses in the area too. Long live East Liberty!!!
1,"I drive by this place every day on the way home from work.  So after reading good reviews I decided to try it.  After a dinner of fried everything I think I will need a cardiac exam.  I had fried fish and shrimp and fries.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp.  My dad had fried okra and fried zucchini.  We all shared.  The zucchini was good, I like their batter, but I would have preferred thicker slices of zucchini.  I'm not afraid of having an actual vegatable.  The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry, I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle, but this one isn't it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldn't taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.  We did get a side of coleslaw that was as good as any I've had from the Safeway deli."
1,"I don't do dollar stores often, but I thought I'd head in to this one a couple of weeks back as I was in need of some Halloween candy and anything else that struck my fancy.  \n\nI wasn't impressed.\n\nThe store had a poor selection, but I managed to find about $30 worth of things to purchase.  It didn't seem very clean or organized either.  At check-out, the woman was not friendly at all and when I went to leave with my cart, I was stopped at the door by the big pole attached to the car.  (I guess the carts are only to be used inside the store and this stops them from leaving).\n\nI do not plan on returning to this store.\n\nIf you are interested in visiting a store for cheap / affordable items of all kinds, I think the 99 cent store may be a better option.  They carry produce and more food products also.  I'll be taking my dollars elsewhere moving forward.  Sorry dollar tree."

1,"I came in from NYC this weekend to experience Scottsdale and was taken to The Breakfast Club by a friend who lives in the area. I can honestly say much of my experience here can be best summed up by the word / sound \""Meh\"" \n\nI was quoted a wait time of around 10 mins but it ended up being closed to 30 mins. The waitress was ok but not overly attentive. The coffee was alright. I ordered the Huevos rancheros which was actually pretty good. I order this dish whenever I can and this was a great authentic green chili version. I thought the pork was top notch but the egg was entirely too small for the size of the dish. Having enough egg to add to every bite is what makes the dish perfection and this fell a bit short.\n\nAll and all I think you can easilly get a better breakfast at over easy but it's not in downtown scottsdale. The location was very cool and gave me a nice feel for the city. Bottom-line not the worst place to get breakfast but you could do better."
4,"Easily my favorite local place to eat!!! I order the same thing every time because it's SO good that I just can't get myself to venture away from it. It's the Local DIsh Burger & it is to die for!!!! The burger is cooked to perfection, then it's topped with pimiento cheese, thick crispy bacon, and spinach and served on a pretzel roll. OMG, it makes my mouth water thinking about it!!! I've also tried (because other people have ordered it :-) ) the chicken & waffles (YUM!), the chicken wings (which, according to my daughter, are the BEST in town - and she would know!!!), the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich (awesome), and the cheese fondue (SO good, but could use more toast points with it!) \n\nSo happy to have such a wonderful place to eat in Fort Mill. I would much rather stay local & support local than driving uptown. I can't recommend Local Dish highly enough!!! Incredible fresh food, fast & friendly service, & a homey atmosphere.\n\nHeading there for lunch today!!"
4,This is a great restaurant a little on the pricy side but it's very good the service was great and there is a lot of good people watching I was very intertained with the couples I saw coming in
0,"I'm only giving one star as I have no choice (that I can tell).\n\nHere's my story...\n\nYesterday we called to have food delivered.  After the experience I had, I wrote on their facebook wall.  \""They\"" wrote me back to ask if I had spoken to a manager about my experience.  This is my response back...\n\nYes I did but by that time, the csr Ryan had already upset me so bad, there was no going back. The guy was the rudest I've encountered yet. We are walking distance from the cutoff for delivery but was totally willing to drive up the street to Chandler Regional to pick up. He acted like he didn't want to do that but then said ok. Although he admitted he lives next to this hospital himself, he wanted me to give him the address for \""safety\"" reasons. So, I googled the hospital and gave him the address that was on the hospital website. He then argued that the address I had given him was not an address he had in his system from prior deliveries there... Kept putting me on hold (about 5 times) to check with his manager... I ask him if he HAD the address, why was he insistent that I give him what he already knows... He said, \""you know what?! We're not delivering to you as you are outside our delivery area!\"". I was in the process of speaking when he intrupided me to tell me this. I had found another address for the hospital and was trying to give that one to him. He continuely over spoke me... He was rude! He was unprofessional. He was condesceding. I was willing to drive to freaken pick up the order although it's stupid not to drive one more block to deliver... Actually less than! I understand boundries which is why I was willing to compromise. I was in no way, form or fashion rude or even demanding with this jerk... Until, of course, he wouldn't shup up long enough to hear me... THE CUSTOMER! The manager who came to the phone was just as condescending. \""I will talk to Ryan...\"". No she won't! She was feeding him the information and he was speaking it to me, THE CUSTOMER, with her right there as there was no delay in him hanging up and her picking up. This behavior is so much more than unacceptable. We had had an awesome day as a family and was winding down and decided we'd order from there. His unprofessionislm and rudeness **** near ruined my night which in turned caused my family upset. I expect and will accept nothing less than professionislm when dealing with a company where I am a paying customer!\n\nNot only will I ever call them or eat there again, I will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this location, at the very least!\n\nAnd, of course, they haven't responded..."
1,"Libraries aren't what they used to be, are they? They aren't so quiet, and their hours are shorter now that people can conduct research online from home. How do you keep people coming? You have to compete with places like Starbucks to give people a reason to come and hang out.  This library has a cafe, like many libraries do now. It's a cute little area where you can buy beverages and snacks and small lunches.  \n\nThe library seems a bit older, with furnishings that could use a little updating, but what's most important for most patrons are the literary offerings, the comfort level, and ease of studying. Can you sit for hours? Are there enough plugs?  My group reserved a small meeting room and plugged in our laptops for an afternoon meeting.  We were able to use free wifi, which is to be expected at libraries these days.  Signing up for a new card took a couple of minutes.  \n\nThe meeting room was barebones basic. We noticed that we stuck to the grimy, wooden chairs, which was pretty gross. \n\nA good cleaning would help this place out."
1,"I have read through many of the reviews here and they have confirmed my findings.  I  was staying at the Wynn with my girlfriend and we decided to give this place a shot.  Let me start by saying that if you come from a town that has real high end sushi places, you will find this place to be mediocre.  The environment is clean, nice and friendly.  The service was slow for us.  The food was OK, not great though. The quality of food did not justify the price.  We had 3 rolls, 1 soup and 1 salad, 1 beer and 1 cocktail and the bill was $110. I'm used to paying about half that for places just as nice in Los Angeles, or the same price for a much higher end sushi restaurant.   I know its in a casino resort, but I still expect a bit more.  I would have given it 3 stars but both my girlfriend and I got sick from the food."
0,"This was the most unprofessional company that my husband and I have ever dealt with any where.  We currently live in New Jersey and are purchasing a home in Charlotte.  We decided to use Screenmobile to install security screens and doors.  We made it clear that we would be flying in for the sole purpose of getting an estimate and meeting with the owner.  \n\nWell the owner made the meeting and made some good suggestions but failed to follow through.  It has been three weeks and we have not received an estimate or a phone call explaining the delay.  I have called twice to find out the reason for the delay and when we can expect installation but each time the owner, David isn't there and he never returns my calls.  This company has horrible customer service and clearly doesn't want our business.  My husband and I have moved on to a different company, DB Doors.  They returned our call immediately and gave us an estimate within a few hours.  I would not use Screenmobile.\n\nI must say however that Debbie at Screenmobile is awesome.  She tried as best she could to help us and emailed David several times but she can only do so much sense the lazy person is her boss."
0,"guidos has really good french fries. REALLY REALLY GOOD. like sneak them off your husband's plate when he's in the bathroom even though you already have your own good...\n\n...but remember all those people you hated in high-school? the ones you figured would join a fraternity or sorority to try and legitimize the fact that they are drunk, mentally disturbed, and semi-literate? remember how you thought they'd all still be acting like jack-asses in their thirties? well, you were right, and i promise you, they are hanging out at guidos right now with five hundred of their best friends."
0,"Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \""two of us, but is there a wait??\"" She responds, \""yes at least 10-15 minutes\"".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."
2,"I've lived here for about a year now so I figure it's safe that I've experienced everything I need to for making a review. I'll make this simple via pros/cons. \n\nPros:  I like the style of the building and it's proximity to downtown and the freeways. Pretty easy to get to many different spots from this location via I-15/95 to 215. The staff that work in security, valet, HOA, and maintenance are all quite friendly. Parking for guests is valet only which is nice so they don't have to park on the side/back which is a pretty shady area. Another reviewer posted about valet blocking the inbound parking entrance, that has been recently changed and the valet is now due West at the entrance loop thus no longer blocking the inbound lane. The building is VERY secure. Current regulations do not allow guests in the building and up the elevators without being escorted by a resident. Cameras at all entrances, in all elevators; have not noticed any in the garage. Key fobs to get in from garage, from lobby to elevators and inside elevator to your floor. This place has become locked down like no other place in town.  The gym is a very nice and clean facility. The pool, while nice and generally clean, is a bit stark in its design and landscape/hardscape design. The lobby and common areas are kept quite clean; likely varies by floor and if you happen to live with slobs on your floor...mine is pretty good in this regard. I've only used the concierge for dry cleaning and that is a nice feature to have. Choose Tiffany cleaners, not the other company they are setup with. \n\nCons: The majority of the units only have one assigned parking spot deeded with the unit and the spots are about 20% more narrow than they should be...cramped and door dings possible. The recent security lock down due to hookers, pimps, drug dealers inhabiting the place creates a big inconvenience for us normal folk. Guest drives up, security calls you, you grant access to valet, guest walks to security desk in lobby and you must come down to the lobby to escort them up to your unit; pain in the ass. I get the reasoning behind this rule and hope if/when the thugs and losers are kicked out we can go back to the proper system of security sending the guest directly to your floor electronically as it should be. The area around the building...shady and crime ridden. Do not walk north of the property alone or at night is all I can say. Laundry in the units is a horrible one piece stacked unit...it's loud and will ruin your laundry quickly. Water pressure delivered to the unit is horrible. I've had people out three times to resolve, still horrible. I feel sorry for those that have long hair as you will not properly rinse out the shampoo with this low of a pressure. Should you wish to take a bath...plan ahead!  It takes 24.5 minutes to fill my tub; yes I timed it. The tub/shower combo is a poor design...the outter edge is round; it's hard to explain but good luck keeping water INSIDE the shower when you use it, your floor will be wet and you've been warned :-)\n\nOverall I'd give this place a 2.5-2.75 if I could but felt somewhat generous due to the cleanliness and friendly staff. Not sure how long I'll stay...grass is always greener you know?  Price per square foot is high if you compare to a normal apartment or house but is lower than the overall Vegas price per square foot for hi-rises."
2,"Although aimed at guys, I would have loved Route One if I was six years younger when I used to frequent shops like Fopp and Hellfire in Glasgow. \n\nIf you're into skateboarding then they have an excellent range of skateboards and skater related merchandise. They have a great selection of trainers and \""cool dude\"" clothing and if you're looking for a gift for a guy friend who is into this kind of thing then they have quirky mugs, belts and other very affordable accessories.\n\nAs far as skateboarding items go, the prices here are very reasonable and the goods are top notch too."
1,"I really liked the outdoor area and the view, but that's about it.  It was very odd walking though an office space to get there, and there's not much else around it once you get there.  I'm not sure if it's still considered uptown, but it's fairly close if you're okay with driving from center city.\n\nAnyway, It was pretty empty when we went and the decor was okay.  I'll likely visit again soon this summer to take advantage of the patio...but there are several other places I'll go to first.\n\nBTW...the drinks are pretty good...service was kinda bland tho :-/"
0,"I would not rent from them. They are thieves. The only reason I'm giving them one star is because they upgraded our car at no addition cost because the class car we rented was not available. We never take the optional insurance. We are covered by other means. We were asked if we wanted the insurance and clearly said, NO. when we returned the car we were charged for insurance. We were extremely exhausted and had been waiting a long time in line for the car. By the time we got all the paperwork we just signed where we were told to without double checking everything. The agent clearly took advantage of our exhaustion and robbed us of $150 for insurance that we refused but he checked yes. Go with another option if it costs you a couple extra dollars."
1,The first time I went to Miguel's I ordered the fajita plate. That was pretty good. The second I brought my wife and we ordered the special Steak Burrito plate. We also ordered guacamole on the side. Nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh. The steak was like the Philly cheese steak you would get from a frozen box and the guacamole was definitely not fresh avocado. The chips and salsa... chips were made fresh as they were still warm and salsa could be freshly made but not sure. I was disappointed the second time. Not sure if I would go back. I can make better Mexican food than this place.
2,"With all of the talk about this place we had to go here while visiting Edinburgh from the US. As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \""benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose. \n\nWent there for lunch....results:\n\nAmbience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \n\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.\n\nDrinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\n\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\n\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\n\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best. But, all agreed the ambience was outstanding. Would go there again for dinner because this place is so special but with the hope of a better food experience.\n\nI"
1,"Very small parking area! It get's super busy on the weekend and because the parking isn't great, it become a war zone :-("
3,"Sushi for three!  \nI am terrible at ordering sushi. So my darling friend Jen took the lead. \nWe ended up with  2 appetizers - Dragon Balls and deep fried veg, and 40 pieces of sushi - not sure exactly what they were, but there were some California rolls, eel, salmon, cucumber, rice, seaweed wrap and a whole bunch of delicious things! \nPictures to follow! \n\nNice touch: they bring hot towels to your table! Service was attentive and prompt. \nThe restaurant is on a quiet street in Old Montreal, walking distance to a street, I don't remember the name...sawrrrry!\n\nFood was absolutely amazing! We couldn't finish the two plates between three of us. Next day left overs were amazing though!\n\nYum!"
2,"Okay so yes Mike and Tony's has arguably the best Gyro in the Burgh, but the love affair for me ends there.  Oh and just a gyro is less than $5.00 dollars which makes for a very affordable lunch.  The downtown location is gross, there was bum piss in the door way. It should be some ones job to wash away the bum piss before they open their doors for business. The mural on the wall is very outdated and looks cheesy and the plaster is chipping away inside.  If anything just take your gyro to go.\n\nI have never eaten anything besides a gyro from Mike and Tonys but my boyfriend likes the grilled chicken salads."
0,"I went to the suncoast for the $7.11 steak and lobster special. Since it was suppose to be a 5 oz. steak like the website said, I got a tiny piece and when asked for it to be changed both the server and manager said its supposed to be 4 oz and they weren't going to change it. I will not be returning to any Boyd casinos after the way I was treated by the management at the suncoast. I've left 2 comment cards and no response I guess if you don't spend lots of money you don't matter to them."
0,I ate here a hour ago. Feeling pretty sick hope its not food poisoning. Tried alot of the seafood. Not to impressed. The food didnt seem as warm as it should have. My fault for eating it I guess....would not recommend !!!!!
2,"This place has a marquee sign on The Strip near the MGM Grand; next to the M&M Candy store. The actual theater is behind the Hard Rock Cafe`.\n\nIt's an old theater with a slanted floor and very wide screen. The projection and sound systems are very modern. \n\nTicket and consession prices are about what you would expect at a movie theater in a large, busy tourist town. It's a great alternative to gambling, drinking, and dancing.\n\nI'd come here again."
0,"Delivered to your hotel if you ordered $15 worth of food so I was hungry and it was between this place or a Italian place and I didn't feel like having Italian so this place won.\nI got a sweet tea which was watered down. A bowl of egg drop soup, the soup was the only thing good. And I ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken which came with a huge portion of fried rice and chcken with the sweet and sour sauce on the side. The chicken was cold and old tasting as was the rice. Really all I ate was the soup. Not good. Also the person that dropped off the food had no personality....didn't even say thank you."
4,"Yum!! Thanks to Yelpers I had a great breakfast every day here! We stayed at THEHotel at Mandalay and I used yelp to find a decent place to have breakfast. I'd recommend. They have a mimosa buffet breakfast on Sundays with an amazing bloody Mary! We ate here Sat and Sunday. Sunday had the omelet bar with premium ingredients (i.e. crab, asparagus) and each day they had someone making baby donuts and hand dipping them in front of you with different toppings! I want to go back!"
1,"If I had use one word to describe Lino's I'd say overpriced. My experiences with Lino's was ordering a Lino special pizza , Chicken parmigiano sub , Chicken picatte , Lino's calzon and two meatballs on side. The dough on the pizza was hard like a rock , the sauce was flavorless but the toppings were seasoned correctly and in good amounts. The sub was typical but really dry. The chicken picatte tasted like spaghetti with water. The calzon was typical but really small for 11$. The Meatballs were the right size and had just the right amount of seasoning on them. Overall their food was mediocre and overpriced. As for the customer service  , it was friendly , they took care of my order with no problems and delivery was about the right time on arrival 40min."
0,"I firmly believe everyone is entitled to a \""bad day\"", so I'll count this as Linda's Hoosier Cafe's bad day. Went in for breakfast the first time hoping to have the same level of service/food quality at the other place called Hoosier Cafe on Warner. Didn't get even close. \n\nThe goods: Waitress was an absolute sweet heart! Place seemed really tidy and well kept. The prices seem really reasonable. There was a good selection of breakfast \""specials\"" posted up front.\n\nThe bads: The food took FOREVER to come out. My over medium egg had runny whites. The bacon was thin and nearly flavorless (cheap bacon probably kept too long in a steam table). I love me some bacon, and the fact that I didn't even eat more than 1/2 a piece really says something. My coffee cup went empty several times before I got refills. The syrup served with the pancakes was awful. It was very bland and tasted more like Karo syrup with brown coloring as opposed to maple syrup. I know REAL maple syrup is expensive, and for the price I wouldn't expect it here, but jeez, spend a little more on some higher quality syrup please. Mrs. Butterworth's would have been better.  Even the Tabasco sauce was sub-par. The bottle label was all faded and peeling, making me think this place refills with watered down Tabasco. Is that even possible with the tiny bottle openings?  \n\nAll that said, I will go back and give another chance because the waitress was so nice and apologized for the syrup and slowness with the food. I also want to try the B&G.  I think this place could be really good if the management would heed all the negative comments and make some modest changes."
4,Made my appointment online at 8am. Show up a few minutes before 8am and I'm out by 8:15am!! I cut in front of 2 people. I would recommend making an appt! \nThe guy the took me back was nice and knew what he was doing. I don't like getting things taken out of me..they are inside for a reason :p But it didn't hurt. In and OUT! Great place since I have UHC! Make sure they take your insurance before getting there!
3,"Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo"
2,"I saw the grand opening sign so I decided to get lunch. \n\nI wasn't feeling pho today, but I'm a fan of com tam and can be in the mood for rice all day, every day. I got a rice plate with Viet sausage, sliced BBQ pork, shrimp, baked egg \""casserole\"", fried egg ($9.50). Viet sausage kinda reminds me of a cross between spam and Portuguese sausage in texture. Sliced pork, baked egg and fried egg are all fine however the shrimp was odd. The seared areas tasted a bit of chemical...like it touched gas or lighter fluid. \n\nFood came out quick, the girl was friendly when I ordered, but there wasn't really \""service\"" per se. I had to walk up to the counter to pay since sitting there wasn't gonna get me a check nor a empty cup will get a refill. \n\nThey just opened a week ago so I'll see if they'll work out kinks and I'll try their pho to get a feel for their menu. I think it needs to be very good to warrant that they're a bit more than most pho spots...so far, it hasn't warranted the price with taste, quality or portion."
0,"I needed a basic detail of the car so they gave me the Groupon special price of $49. Everything seemed nice but when I checked the carpet-it was not shampooed. Then they said it was my fault I did not understand the ad correctly because there is a difference between carpet and carpets shampooed. They did not do any of them but offered to shampoo the mats. No, thank you, that's not what I needed. Manager and owner kept saying the same thing to me and I asked them to look at the ad together which they denied and said I am the first person to complain...ever. I am very disappointed. Here is a copy of their ad:\n\""Just like people, cars need their exteriors cared for just as much as their interior workings. At Showtime Carwash Premier Auto Spa and Detail Center, cars receive that expert care with a variety of car washes and detailing treatments. That expert care means staffers gently hand-wash autos and provide upgrades such as Rainbow Wax applications and tire dressings. They can even keep crud from gunking up engine parts with engine washes. Their detailing work gets even deeper into the nitty-gritty and includes special treatments such as carpet shampoos.\"" Carpet shampoos..."
0,"I love BBQ, and always went to Famous Dave's.  Looking for a new BBQ place, I found Li'l Porgy.  My first impression when I first entered the establishment was disappointment.  It was small, dull, and not clean.  I did hope that the food would be good, but it was another disappointment.  I ordered rip tips and it smelled bad.  I haven't been back there ever since."
2,"First time at Makino the pictures from other peoples reviews had my mouth watering to go, I first tried a plate of various Sushis all the options and toppings were great however I was a little let down that they did not have my favorite \""eel\"" available that dinner it was overall good and most tasted fresh. I then tried the oyster and mussels they were both delicious as well as the crab legs with a hot pot of butter right there ready for your taking but the crab legs do come cold just a quick note if you do prefer them warm at a buffet; these ones come on ice however they have the crab openers ready on your table. I also tried some sliced steak and ribs, the ribs tasted a little left out from lunch or reheated but the sliced steak was yummy. The fried rice was good the noodles right next to them weren't my taste but others might like it. Also the assortment of different salads was great nice and full of dressing. Now the fun part I tried a couple different deserts my favorite was the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, green tea ice cream and of course the chocolate fountain try as much as you can they have all kinds of different ice cream to. It was overall good for the price some dishes weren't as fresh as I would of liked I'm from Seattle so I'm used to really fresh seafood but for Vegas this is a good choice the decor is pretty plain and it's kind of awkward when your placed right by the food but your trying so much food I'm sure it will be hard to notice after a while and the big octopus in the corner is pretty cool sure you'll find a couple things you like hope this was helpful."
1,This place is a last resort if I need something. There never seems to be anyone shopping in there but somehow every time I'm waiting forever on a line. They seem to hire the slowest cashiers that look like they are being tortured just working there. I honestly don't know how this place is still in business. They also do not have a great selection on most items.
3,"There once was a Nader that craved delicious food one Saturday morning. On this particular Saturday morning, Nader was living in Tempe, close to Broadway and McClintock, and after much thought (and inquiry with his hungry girlfriend) he decided to go to Royal Taj for Indian buffet. \n\nNader's tummy rumbled with fierce fierceness the second he stepped in! He went in for a little bit of this and a little bit of that, filling his plate with a plethora of rich flavors! But then, right as he thought he chose all that he would choose on his visit to the buffet line, he noticed chicken curry. Nader knew right then that this Saturday was a special day! He had never tried Royal Taj's chicken curry before because it had never been out during previous visits. \n\nExcited, he rushed back to the table and filled his cheeks with all the wonderful dishes, making sure to save some of the curry for the naan. After his first bite of the curry, he smiled cheek to cheek! The curry was wonderful and actually a little bit spicy, with bone-in pieces of chicken for enormous amounts of flavor! \""Oh, how this food is amazing today!\"" he said after a couple of plates! Nader was very pleased! Nader was also very full, and he vowed to eat that curry again! \n\nOn that particular Saturday, Nader left Royal Taj a better man. A better man because he now had a mission to not let Royal Taj go unnoticed when it came to East Valley Indian cuisine. But it is up to you, Yelp user, to go give it a try yourself. So go! Go and feast upon the glory that is Royal Taj!"
2,"I guess I expected a lot. I had the scallops which were very good. The lobster mash was a little bland and cucumber martini I liked but it was weird and my co-worker took a sip and throught it was gross. I like weird things sometimes. Of course it was Vegas and overpriced but the scallops really were pretty perfect. However, you only get three and I am a big eater and left there kinda hungry. I don't mind spending money in Vegas but I want to leave the restaurant full."
1,"I'm going to preface by saying that the staff is really awesome.  Hostess was sweet, our server Courtney was wonderful and a manager came out and checked on us.\n\nBut the food is so gross.  Not gross like in a McDonald's sort of way, but just bland, blah, whatever.  We went for a happy hour and they offer \""$2 off\"" type of things, not set prices like $5 for this, this and this, etc.  Know what I mean?  Just wasn't my thing and I won't go back to spend money on food."
4,"I've been going to Braddah's since the first location opened on rainbow so I was thrilled when I found out one would be opening across the street from my school! I have lunch here at least once a week and I still can't get enough. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I've actually stopped going to chipotle since Braddahs opened because it's just so much better. My favorite thing to get is a steak burrito with seaweed rice, beans, Maui onion salsa, cheese, guac, cilantro, sour cream and some lime mmmmm also the pig is wonderful. The real gem of this place is the coconut bark, no matter how full I am from the burrito I can always eat a whole box of that lovely bark. Seriously try some! Everyone who works here is always super nice and helpful/inviting. So much love for Braddah's!"
2,"The Skinny: great customer service when booking by phone (5!) but a show that lacks spectacle and story (3).\n\nOkay, the travelzoo promotion site was down so I had to call the reservation line to book tickets for La Reve this weekend. Expecting to wait on the line for at least 2-3 minutes, I'd settled down with a cup of tea, a book and comfy slippers.\n\nTo my surprise, the phone was answered in less than a minute. I'm not even sure I heard the dialtone! The lady on the line was super friendly and took my order for 3 tickets right away. We started chatting about Vegas and I mentioned that I was a local.\n\n\""A local? Let me look and see if the locals deal can apply to your tickets for you.\"" Say what? \""Okay, it looks like the locals deal is better for you. Let me go ahead and apply that discount.\"" But I looked online and there wasn't a locals deal advertised currently. \""Sometimes we don't advertise about the local deal but the promotion is ongoing.\"" Sweet! How's that for excellent customer service? That is 5-star service folks!\n\nNow on to the actual performance.\n\nLe Reve is definitely a dream... like as in the what-the-hell-is-going-on-here kind of nightmare. At its essence, the show lacked that one key thread that holds everything together - a storyline.\n\nIt starts off with this girl in white with her boyfriend who sits on a park bench which becomes immersed in water. Then the girl is dressed in red. Let the odd dreams sequences with all these bald dudes begin!\n\nReally, the best parts of the show were the clowns. They literally stole the show and ought to have a larger role throughout the piece. They seemed to be the only ones during the show that actually were trying to tell the audience something. \n\nThere is a lot of dancing/synchronized swimming so don't expect many acrobatic feats during this production. Not to mention the majority of the acrobatic feats are aerial in nature. So if you don't like aerialists or dancers, don't go to this show!\n\nTo be honest with you, I think that the acrobats/dancers must work their patootie off for this production because they definitely perform numerous roles within the show. However it's a major flaw that these obviously talented, versatile people don't get their moment to shine. During the show, there's so many things going on all at once, the actual performance of the individuals gets lost in the frey. It's a too much sensory overload and it shows.\n\nAlthough some of the sequences were quite beautiful, they lack cohesiveness and personality to make this a truly great show. For that, this show gets a 3 starred review."
2,"While staying at the Boulder Station last week we ate lunch one day and dinner the next at the Feast Buffet.  The food was pretty good, not great, and there was a lot of variety.  The restaurant was clean and organized.  I noticed the choices were almost identical both days which would have kept us from returning a 3rd time.  The price was very reasonable and service was good.  Not bad, but I've certainly eaten in better buffets.  Would go again the next time we're in town."
3,"Trader Joe's is really a good place to shop - they have great produce, meat/poultry/fish, cheese, dairy, flowers, dry goods and their prepared products are usually very good and interesting/flavorful.  Wine/beer/liquor/cider selection is also very good.\n\nTheir retailing approach also generally keeps prices reasonable, although some things can be a bit pricey (but the quality is commesurate).\n\nService is very friendly as well, and they always have a treat for my child when finding Koko the monkey.  Return policy is very good as well if you get something that isn't quite right.\n\nI particularly like this location, as having Trader Joe's here (and this is similar in other locations) means more walk in traffic to the other businesses in what generally are strip malls that are older and need some redevelopment."
4,"I called ahead of time before making an appointment to ask some health questions about blood work for our dog. The receptionist was extremely helpful and very sweet which instantly convinced me after calling a few vets that this was the one I wanted to take our dog too. It also worked out nicely being so close to our house. \nThe Doctor was also very helpful and understanding. We were sent by a dog trainer to get blood work due to our dogs \""aggression\"" and instead of the doctor just agreeing to do it to make money, she informed us the symptoms of each of the problems we wanted to check and said that our dog's aggression did not fall under any of the categories. She even had some recommendations for trainers and behaviorists that she has worked with herself with her own dogs. We were very grateful for her insight and her obvious love for dogs. The exam was reasonable too, under $50. We do not permanently live in Arizona but I am glad that we will have a place to go if need be in the future!"
4,"My first Michael Mina.\n\nAfter learning that we would have to wait almost 2 hours for craftsteak, my friends and I decided to eat at Michael Mina's Seablue.  I am so glad we did!  It was, quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences of my life.\n\nThe four of us started with an oyster each.  Two of us had Kumamotos and the other two had Raspberry Points.  They were so fresh and delicious!  It was a great beginning for what the rest of the meal would taste like.  The \""bread\"" for the table was actually naan.  It came with a trio of dips - hummus, roasted eggplant, and a creamy cheese.  Our two appetizers were tasting trios.  The steamed trio came with mussles, clams and prawns.  The raw trio came with yellowtail, salmon and tuna.  OMG!  It was so so so good!  We used the naan to sop up the juices produced from our steamed trio.  We ate so much of it that we even asked for more naan, which they brought out with more dip.  Seriously, we knew we were going to hurt from all that food, yet somehow, we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nBy the time our entrees came out, we were stuffed.  Still, we knew the culinary experience was not one to be passed up so we ate on.  We ordered the Seablue \""paella\"" (it was a tad salty on the bottom), the scallops, and the 16 oz bone-in NY steak.  The food was excellent!  As much as we wanted to finish everything on the table (hey, we knew it was costing a pretty penny), we couldn't stuff our over-stuffed selves.  So, it broke my heart but we left some food on the table because we wanted dessert.  Damn those people who sat next to us, because we probably wouldn't have ordered more food were it not for us seeing their lovely order of desserts.  Being troopers, we rallied each other and ordered what they had - the white chocolate napoleon and the molten chocolate cake.  I've never been a big fan of napoleons but that was the best dessert I've had in a really long time - and I'm a fan of desserts!\n\nOur waiter, bless him, never judged our need to overindulge.  He was professional and efficient and the service was 4 star.  As sometimes happens with fancy places, I am so glad that bad service is not something this place has to worry about.\n\nThis was the best meal I have had this year.\nYay (fellow Marin resident) Michael Mina!!"

3,"This isn't *just* a lunch review. I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...\n\nFor lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places. \n\nI ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their \""light\"" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment. \n\nMy friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there. \n\nAnyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then \""chopped\"" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!\n\nMy other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the \""special culinary name\"" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too. \n\nI also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill! \n\nSoooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple \""light\"" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see? \n\nCowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20. \n\nOh yeah, and Sean, our server, was A+. \n\nCan't wait to go back for dinner..."
3,"I go out of my way to find a Fry's. Great customer service, excellent quality in food, great prices, clean stores & fuel points. I buy my gift cards for work and what ever I want to spend money on then turn around and get the discount at the pump. Good call! you'll always find me shopping at Fry's"
4,"Super cute shop! A must go for those in need of cute clothes and accessories who are trying to shop local. \n\nThe prices are very affordable. The tops I got were around $20 and the cute ring was $7. \n\nInterestingly enough, they really do have something for everyone. My 62 year old other got some cute stuff along with my friend's 9 year old daughter. They even have plus sizes. \n\nCute items for all!"
1,"I'm not rating the product, only the customer service level of the older gentleman (owner/worker) not sure of their status. I took my daughter since she wanted to see what they carried, since I boosted about this market. We were both very impressed and decided that this is where we will start purchasing most of our meats. However, the only thing that they do not carry, that my daughter loves are turkey chops. That will not be a problem. We didn't really make a purchase other than some cheese, that looked wonderful and I just had to try it. A little over $3 and I used my debit card. This gentleman with no personality, took my card that I handed to him. (Key words: \"" I handed ). Rang my total and place my card on the counter. (Dear Lord, that makes my blood boil, hair stand on the back of my neck, eyes bleed). You know what I'm talking about. Placed my receipt on the counter for my signature. Took the receipt, no eye contact, placed in the drawer and never said \""thank you\"" \""come again\"" \""hit the road\""...nothing! I am going to try them again. I can assure you when it comes to customer service, \""3 strikes, you're out\"", does not apply here. They will get one more chance. What's more annoying is that I have told several people about this market and each person has gone, made a purchase and loves the product. Maybe they should keep personality-less in the back and not have customer contact."
1,"Not worth the money! Today was my step sons bday and his mother arranged a party here. The cost for the package was $240, and included pizza, soda, and decorations and a free round of laser tag and mini golf. We payed an extra $90 to add more kids because it only included 15. None of this bothered me til we got there and had to ask for cutlery,  they provided the cake,  but no cake cutter, no tokens for the kids to play games, the bathroom was disgusting. To top it all off, we were only given an hour and a half,  to eat, have cake, play games, and they were rushing us before we could even open gifts! Any person with kids knows it takes a lot longer to have a party, and for what we paid they should be able to not rush through this! Good news is the birthday boy had a blast, but we won't be returning,  too expensive and it's not worth it!!"
1,"I've been coming to this location for several years. I used to come almost once a week after work, when the late night specials were great. Now I remember why I don't come anymore. The late night food specials suck compared to what they used to be here and suck compared to any other late night dining option. Service is hit or miss."
0,"Not sure what's going on with this restaurant. Had dinner there tonight and the place was practically deserted. They didn't have the wine we wanted and several items from the printed menu were not available. I had the ribs. They smelled great, but that's where it ended. The meat was dry and although the menu stated the dish came with sweet potato fries, guess what, they came with regular fries.\nThe bread pudding was good, though, and the waitress was very friendly, apologizing for every disappointment we faced.\nBut I would take a pass on this place, at least until they get their act together.\nBack to my first comment about the dinning room being empty: perhaps others have had similar experiences... Hope things improve in the future."
3,"I have been enjoying the massages with hot rocks and great service for over a year now and yes, I'm a fan. My last visit I tried a gel manicure and now I'm a convert. The manicure I received 9 days ago, still looks pristine, shiny. The application process is more involved and takes a little longer that the standard manicure but for only 10 dollars more - it is so worth it."
1,Outdated rooms. An old crowd and no Jacuzzi
4,"Legit.\n\nThe Barrymore has been a seminal contribution to the post-2009 Las Vegas lounge renaissance.  \n\nThe restaurant is small, the service is old Vegas both in style and literally, with some wait staff known to discriminating customers for decades here.  They seem to know when to show up and when to leave you to your conversation.  The booths are classic design and the ambiance almost unmatched.  The menu is sophisticated French fusion.  Beautiful presentations which the chef makes sure are as you like them.\n\nThe bar has an outdoor patio heated in the winter.  Inside is a small lounge area at which they often have some of the best entertainers in Las Vegas, including Nieve Malandra singing jazz and standards. \n\nThe room off the east end of the bar could use some re-thinking, perhaps best for private events only.  Be sure to be seated in the main restaurant for dining.  Full menu at the bar and the perfect cocktail join a large wine list.  \n\nThe design is a very sophisticated theme based on the Barrymore motion picture family.  Well done and one of my favorite haunts."
0,"In a market that is known for it's golf this course leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice...\nOver all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up.\nWhen you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest. Unfortunately the playing area was just horrible."
3,"I didn't have an opportunity to try a full sized cake but the red velvet bundlett was divine...super moist and not overly sweet.  I love the fact that you can buy these mini-sized cakes - they're still shareable and reasonably priced $4 - $5.\n\nService was friendly and the store is super cute and clean.  Since I want to be able to fit into my clothing, I can't stop in too often when visiting Phoenix but I will make it a point to come back to try more flavors."
0,"Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is still seared in my mind & it was so disappointing because I planned our entire anniversary trip around this dinner. The most ahhhmazing part was when the car rolled up to the villa and the gates parted and than you are ushered into this plush, decadent restaurant. I should have known something was up since it was so easy to get reservation. We ordered the Menu A $250 per person. It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste. The alcohol drink we ordered was nasty too. \n\nShort Review: Save your money, don't go here! Unremarkable food, paired with bad service. \n\nLong Review:\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n1A) Green Asparagus...What a joke, anybody could have made it, no creativity to it.\n1B) Spiced Lobster...My fave dish that night, but I'm partial to lobster.\n\n2A) Green Pea Cream Soup...Good, but not memorable.\n2B) Light Daikon soup...Good, but not memorable. \n\n3A) Pan Fried Sea Bass...Fish was fresh, but not memorable. (A running theme of Robuchon.)\n3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, \""Next time, don't take so long to take photos.\"" WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.\n\nThan came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served. \n \n4A) Roasted duck...Okay.\n4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average. \n\nThe Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.  \n\n5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible. At that time, I was too afraid to say anything, lest I get another reprimand from the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother asking why we didn't finish the course. \n\n6A) La Fraise: Nasty tasting, served in a tacky serve ware. \n6B) Le Chocolat: Also nasty, and tacky looking, why is there peacock feathers surrounding it?\n\nThan while we are eating our desserts, strangely they appeared with a cake, say happy anniversary, than walked off. Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.\n\nAt the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh? What kind of policy is this, I never had happened to me at a fine dining establishment. By that time, after this long drawn ordeal, I'm tired, my BF pissed. I randomly chose a few to try, but still you wouldn't want to take these home, even if you could. \n\nVerdict: Save your time and money and go splurge elsewhere."
3,"I feel like the other reviews are a bit unfair so far.  Especially as it seems most of them went during the first 2 weeks the place was open (usually not a good time to judge the quality of a new restaurant).  Personally, with the limited selection of tap beers in the town, this place is a gift.  Tons of micro brews and local suds - some that I haven't even heard of.\n\nLike piano music playing classic hits was nice- not crazy loud.\n\nService was just fine - very friendly.  We ordered a salad with chicken (way too much stuff in the salad) and the fried mushrooms (surprisingly delicious).\n\nOverall, suggest if you are looking for a place with a wide selection of craft/local brews on tap, this place doesn't disappoint."
0,"TIMESHARE PRESENTATION WAS TOO LONG!\n\nAfter spending nearly 3.5 hours for a presentation, I wanted to throw up! The sales ladies were pushy and they take you to through 3 different areas to sell you this scam. No way! I rather just be on the strip and pay a minimal amount if you don't intend to stay in the hotel to sleep anyway. To get 2 free shows is not worth 3.5 hours of your time. Never again!"
0,"Negative baristas heaven forgive they mess up your order and u ask them to remake it. No asking if it was right the second time, still not right but they are so rude ur afraid to ask for them to actually try it again. Also soooo sloooooooowww come on people drink some coffee and get motivated... lets work on niceness and speed."
2,"This spot totally lives up to the hype! The most amazing MASSIVE sandwiches ever. The kids had the fish, the wife had the rAgin Cajun and I had the pastrami! Everything was outstanding. And to top it off we were fortunate to get a picture with the lady who appeared in the episode on DDD. Worth traveling for and very reasonable prices for such large portions.Im home now and i cant stop thinking about that sandwich lol"
0,"I really had great expectation for RM seafood with Rick Moonen being on Top Chef and being so passionate about his food but left with pure disappointment and here is why....\n\nAlthough I made reservation for lunch; when we got there, the restaurant was practically empty so we were seated right away. On the reservation, I stated we are celebrating our anniversary and hubby's birthday but the hostess didn't bother looking at the reservation and acknowledge our celebration like other restaurants did.\n\nAnyway...we didn't have breakfast so I did a quick glance of the menu and was ready to order. We ordered the crab cake $16), clam chowder ($9), lobster roll ($27) and the fish tacos ($17).\n\nThe crab cake just came by it self with some aioli sauce which I thought for $16 bucks, we should have gotten two. It was a medium size crab cake with chunks of crab but who puts pineapple in their crab cakes? I sure don't. I thought the crab cake was bland. I was hoping really bold flavors, at least with a slight kick.\n\nOn came the clam chowder which should have been called bacon chowder since their were more bacon bits than clams. The consistency was watery like soup rather than a chowder. The flavor certainly wasn't the taste of the oceanic clams, it was bacon and dairy (milk and creamy) and left that dairy after taste like I just had a cup of milk which I don't like.\n\nAfter the chowder, it seems like we were done because we waited for about 15 minutes and our entrees have not arrived yet. We waited patiently..mind you again, the restaurant wasn't busy..about only five tables were filled. The waiter finally comes over and asked if we received our entrees yet, and when we said no, he went to check and mentioned they messed up on the orders. At that point, hubby and I was already talking about canceling the rest of our orders and eating at Burger Bar. Unfortunately, when I asked if our orders were being made, hubby's fish was already on the fire so we left it at that but mine wasn't even made yet, so I was able to cancel it. Hubby's fish taco finally came and he enjoyed it but not worth $17.\n\nWhen the bill came, he forgot to take out the lobster roll, so he had to go correct it. Once the initial corrected bill arrived, I noticed there were extra charges thinking there was a sharing charge but it didn't make sense; so I informed the waiter...he realized he charged us the dinner prices! Then he tells us this is his third day...OH MY.....The Manager was there at all times in his fancy suit but never even came over to apologize or anything.\n\nI really don't mind paying more for good food, but paying so much for the quality and service I experienced here was just a letdown especially since it is known as an upscale restaurant. Since Chef Moonen wasn't there, the review is not against him because he seems like a great guy but perhaps, his Chefs needs a little more training on what quality food should taste like and how it is done."
1,"I was really excited to check this place out by I was sorely disappointed with the service. Being someone who has worked in the service indstry, I get really annoyed when I am not acknowledged and have to wait throughout the night like I did a cadillace ranch. Slow service and average food add up to 2 stars."
2,"So I called Mamma Mia and asked about getting two large cheese pizzas and a cannoli for delivery to SkyPark and the youngish woman who answered my call to Momma Mia said that they won't deliver to SkyPark (literally across the parking lot) anymore so I needed to walk over and get my own pizzas, and also that because I had called the pizza place directly (and not had a SkyPark employee call in my order) they had to charge me a higher price for the pizzas!  WTF?!  \n\nExtremely annoyed I turned to the SkyPark employee, while still on the phone with the pizza place, and asked him why he didn't call in the order for me since I had to pay a higher price if I called them, and he just shrugged his shoulders, clearly unsure what to tell me.  \n\nSo after a few minutes I walked over to Mamma Mia where I explain I am there for the pizzas that I called in and I ask why I had to pay a higher price when the SkyPark staff were the ones to instruct me to call them directly, and the cashier immediately starts to go into this great rant about how SkyPark owes them money and they won't deliver pizzas to them anymore and blah, blah, blah...I couldn't believe it.  Mortified was the only emotion I felt.  \n\nSo I paid for my pizzas, checked in on Yelp, got my food and left.  It is worth noting that the pizza was good (flavorful, cheesy and hot) and I got the cannoli free for checking in on Yelp, but yeah, the general attitude from them sucked!  I'm never going back.  \n\n\nThere is never a reason to share dirty business laundry with your customers like that, it's very unprofessional!"
2,"I purchased a Living Social for air duct cleaning under the company name, Blue Sky cleaning. I called and made an appointment and I had to wait about a month because they were so booked up. The technician, called me on the day of the appointment and told me he was at my house.  I arrived and he quickly cleaned my vents. It took him less than 1 hour. He didn't try to upsell me on any additional services."
2,"I feel bad, I really wanted to love this place so that I would have a great low cost option for my stupidly thick hair.  But alas, that was not meant to be.\n\nI went with the level 2 stylist I think.  She was very nice and she seemed to really understand what I needed in a cut and highlights but the end result didn't really match up.  And honestly I have never had a blow out in a salon that looked like a child did it.  The girl told me she wanted to dry my hair before she cut it, which I was okay with.  However, she basically took a flat brush and just kept brushing it with the blow dryer near it.  No round brush was used and she never fixed it after the cut so I had to go home and try and curl it with a brush and a curling iron.  It just looked so weirdly straight but poufy.  It was bad.\n\nThe cut itself was okay.  I had her cut bangs which I haven't had since I was a pre-teen.  They came out pretty good but maybe needed to be a little shorter.\n\nThe highlights were not great.  They looked a tad brassy and she mentioned having to use toner and stuff so I got charged a little extra.  \nIt helped to lighten my hair up when I wear it down, but if I have it in a ponytail it still looks dark.\n\nOverall I liked paying $100 less than I do at other places.  But I think I will keep looking elsewhere for a new go to salon."
2,"Take-out ordered the spicy orange chicken and the Kung Pao for dinner one night. I asked for the chicken to be extra spicy. Got it home and it wasn't so spicy  Otherwise, the meals were pretty good.  Rather along the lines of PF Changs. Nothing to run down the street raving about, but not bad either."
2,"Food was very average...Entree selection was not impressive, deserts were very good.   Ambience was low key-boring....... \n\nNot bad for the price, but not memorable..."
1,The pizza was bad. The problem begins with ordering. The menu gives a few choice of sauce plus a lot of topping. It does not offer any guidance how to create a good pizza. A few signature pizza on the menu would be a welcomes improvement. \n\nThe price adds up quickly with multiple toppings.   I would recommend any fast food joints over this place.
3,"This place has pretty good thai food. Been here a few times.\nWe ordered pad thai, mongolian beef, and pad see eww. The place is nicely decorated, and the waitress/waiter are friendly. First time, our pineapple fried rice took forever to come out. I think they forgot our orders.  But the last two times, the food came out in good time."
2,"This place is now called \""Arizona Bird Store\"" and has moved to a new, nicer location a few miles away from the old hole.  The new store is still quite dirty, though that is to be expected with lots of birds.  We have two African Grey parrots and they can make huge messes in short order so I can't fault the place too much for being dirty.  We've been taking our birds there to be groomed for a few years and generally like the place.  They generally seem to know about birds and do a decent job grooming our birds, but they don't seem to be real bird lovers anymore.  I think perhaps they were genuine bird lovers many years ago, but it seems like the love of birds has probably faded over the years.  I suppose getting bitten regularly could take its toll.  That is, after all, why we take our birds there to be groomed - I don't want them to bite me and associate me with that scary experience if I groom them myself.  I'm the nice guy that rescues my birds from that \""mean\"" person clipping their feathers and trimming their claws.  Overall, the place is good and I trust them with my birds."
0,"I recently had an alignment done on my car at this location (rainbow and 215) and when I got my car back it was in the same if not worst condition   than when I left it. I was informed that one of the nuts for a tie rod was ceased, I didn't have time at the moment to ask for a refund or redo the alignment, so I took it to another Firestone and they had no problems in performing the procedure correctly. I have read some of the reviews for this store and dismissed them, I made a mistake. I would suggest that you do your research when going to places like these, but you can always use my experience, for example, and learn from it. Although the problem was solved, I would recommend that you avoid Firestone altogether, the only honest place in Vegas that I have found is called Allied automotive located on desert inn just west of valley view. Hope this helps."
0,"Server did not know the menu,....45 mins to get our food , but the take out orders were going out within 15 mins.  Had the Hunan Chicken  it  had the consistency of Sushi.  Complained to owner...  his response... its cooked.  never saw or spoke to him again.  I guess he doesn't care about service.  I will say my wife liked her dinner\nThey need to improve their training of staff members and Owner need to care about his customers.\n I will not be back, I can understand me not liking the food but there is NO excuse for POOR service. If the Owner doesn't care why should his staff"
4,"The Bank is HOT!!!!\nThe girls and I went for a \""family\"" weekend the last weekend of August and we went on Thursday night.  Since we're all girls, we got in around 11:00pm for free.  Man, it was FUN!!!!  The club is beautiful with a sunken floor and a great crowd.  For a Thursday night in August, the club was packed and the DJ was sick.  They played everything from hip hop and mash-ups from the 80s and 90s including mashed-up rock songs.  I think UNLV must have been started school that week since there was an active student body on the floor getting their booties spanked and their groove on.  I can't wait to go back for more ...\n\nVegas is HOT!!!!"
4,Their food is made of magic.
0,"Upon entering Riazzi's, Kevin and I were unsure if we had stepped into an Italian restaurant or a nursing home. The patterns on the carpet and booths were horrifyingly dated, and the place was dingy and dark. The only thing that kept me from whole heartedly believing that we were visiting my great grandmother's home was the waiters/waitresses/bus boys playing Rhianna full blast in the kitchen as they talked loudly about their personal lives and friend drama and hair cuts. Food was fine. Nothing to write home about. But the atmosphere, oh gosh. Never again."
2,"Nice stadium.  Very clean but odd watching in a dome since the roof was closed when we were there (end of June and about 112 degrees outside). \nFood was only OK in my opinion, but there was a good variety."
3,"$2.50 pints all day, good food, lots of TVs.   A good find in my neighborhood."
4,"I love them here.  Always been a great experience.   Best doctors ever, very caring.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!!"
2,It not to crowded which is great though it is a little dirty & the parking lot sucks! \n\nFor a Harkins I did expect more out of the theater than what they provided.  In the end it does the job & I can still watch movies in somewhat of a comfort.
4,"I was a bit apprehensive about going to see this exhibit, but as I was with my mother and sister in Vegas, and they wanted to go, I obliged and tagged along.  Boy, I am glad I did!  It's a bit eerie to be standing in a room with a bunch of corpses, but everything is so well-displayed and the chronology of the exhibit makes the whole museum tour flow so much easier. Do not miss the fetus exhibit... it is probably the COOLEST exhibit of all. \n\nIt truly made me aware of how intricate the human body is. \n\nIf the slots and tables didn't eat up your money, do take 2 hours out of your vegas trip to go to this exhibit, it's fantastic."
1,"I usually am quite the fan of Uswirl. I come here once every two weeks or so. On 6/4 at 9PM I walked in with my family to get some frozen yogurt. The service was TERRIBLE. There was nearly NO fruit toppings out and when I asked the girl at the cashier to please grab some strawberries she was on her phone and I had to call her 3 or 4 times to even get her attention. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes. A kid about 15 kept walking in and out of the store and communicating with the other male worker- very unprofessional as I believe they were speaking of drugs or some type of confrontation happening across the way involving their friends. Very dissatisfied."
0,"Customer service is ridiculous!!' Found a strand of hair in their dosa, and the guy said \""since you've already eaten it, I'm sorry, I cannot do anything!\"" Never visiting this place again!!!"
0,"Let me just say that I've never been a fan of this mouse maze from the get go. Even though the furniture goes together with some relative ease, it still is something to be desired. My wife seems to like it though so this place gets one star becuase of her. Let me speak on their customer service and home delivery and installation for a moment though:\n\nWe purchased some cabinets to accent our living room and scheduled home delivery and install. We paid a pretty penny for that service, too. Let the customer beware, you go by their schedule and if you try to reschedule, forget it. They called me the morning of the day that they would be arriving and being the working man I am won't be home, nor will my wife to let them in or take delivery of the cabinets. If you need to reschdule and try and call them to reschedule, they won't. Once they're scheduled its a done deal. Customer service didn't offer any options and so the cabinets will left outside (then again who knows? I sure don't know what's going to happen at this point). And I paid nearly $200 for this? You have to be kidding me! No apologies, no options, no idea what is going to happen. \n\nI'm shaking my head. Thanks a lot IKEA, I'll never shop at your store ever again. You have no customer service and it was a waste of time and money to purchase your products and services that you left me in the dark on."
4,"LOVE this place. Whenever we have guests in town we take them here, and everyone loves it. Such a unique experience with all the couches. Their happy hour offers some really nice pricing."
1,"B\u00e2ton Rouge is normally a restaurant I like to go (the one downtown Montreal, in the Complexe Desjardins, is one of my favorite of the branch). But this one left me...dissatisfied.   \n\nThe service was slow! Like...suuuppeeerrr slow. And yes, they may have a menu for the kids, but because of slowness of the service, your patience will grow thin while you try to calm down toddlers and preschoolers in their chairs. The food was an average \""OK\"", nothing to drool on...except the special lobster poutine they had: that one was pretty good! The cucumber mojito tasted more like water than a mojito, unfortunately.  \n\nOverall, the rest was pretty average for our experience at this branch."
2,"I dont get why a bunch of people are complaining about the Excalibur. Don't hate dudes! You guys need to look at the star rating of hotels before you actually decide to book. If you are dishing out about $85 a night for a 3 star hotel, dont expect 5 F'in star service.  Not to mention you are located on the hottest corner of LV, which is Tropicana and the Strip. Leave your room for christ sakes!\n\nThe room itself was just a room. You get a bed, it smells good and theres one non-high definition TV. View out the window was a parking lot. Fortunately there were elevators that take you up to your room, no stair climbing necessary. The bathrooms were spacious and huge shower areas for those manage sessions with anyone you bring back. Just a word of caution, they do check key cards for everyone going up to the rooms area. Make sure you have your key on you at all times! \n\nOther then that..do all of your clubbing, eating and gambling across the street at MGM or NY NY. They are all walking distance."
3,Had pink and whites done by Henry. He did an awesome job and a very enjoyable person to talk to. Top notch guy with his act together. Thank you very much for an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend!
3,"God, this place is still as great as ever. Quality is always top notch, service is fantastic, and the dishes are still ridiculously delicious.\n\nRemembering that the meatloaf last time was out of this world, I ordered it again this time and it did not disappoint! My friends all loved the dish too and couldn't get enough of it. The crab cakes appetizer was also incredible--lots of fresh crab meat, spiced really well and not overly breaded or greasy.  \n\nMy love for this place still remains strong."
4,"First time here and this place is pretty good. The prices on food is reasonable.  The lentil soup is delicious, and lamb kabob was cooked right."
3,"Awesome meals, especially for the price. I was raving about that the entire meal. And I think I was a fan of the margaritas. I really couldn't remember or drive home."
3,"After spending way too much on my hair cuts over the past few years at salons, I decided to go for the first time into a barber shop with the candy-twirling cylindrical thingy out front.  I had visions of old men getting their ear hair trimmed and getting their sides slicked down with Brylcreem.\nWell, this family-run place has its fair share of old men, but all the barbers have been cutting hair for a good number of years.  This place has weathered the Old Town recession because of good prices, friendly barbers, and decent cuts.  Although they are slowly changing the interior to be more sports-ish (they already have a few TVs on ESPN all the time), they still have the requisite late 80's male hair portraits (which give an uncomfortable gay-man is watching me vibe).  A few of the barbers give excellent shaves.  While two women of the family work there, they are also good at what they do.  My only wish for this place is that they get a few more bigger flat screens and take down those hair portraits because I have yet to witness a dude walking in and point up at the wavy hair of the guy in a popped up collar pink shirt and say \""that's how I want my hair\"".\n***Cash Only***"
4,"Fresh ingredients, good service, wonderful favors. Simple concept that works. Wife had phenomenal turkey sandwich' I had great French toast friends had roast beef sandwich and an appetizer cheese plate with something else that I missed.  If you are a person that likes a huge stack of pancakes, with four eggs and bunch of bacon as a minimum for breakfast this is wrong for you.  The portions are modest but filling for me.  This is about the taste not the poundage.\nWe went for brunch and my screwdriver had fresh squeezed OJ    The Bloody Mary's  Were great   Oh and split an order of fries.  Not a lot of tables but lots of space at bar.  And it is expensive.  But there are other expensive breakfast spots in the area that have disappointed me.  This one doesn't disappoint.  Best thing about our brunch was no adults brought their awful  obnoxious horrible children  So nice to have quiet adults.  I have children in their 20s. I never took them anywhere before they could behave.  I can't wait for my grandchildren to b  here. But they will be polite before they go to a restaurant.  This has nothing to do with cafe bink.  Everything to do with civility   Your child or grandchild is hideous.  Leave them at home when they visit from Minnesota   They suck. Seriously. Everyone hated them on the flight also.  And your wife /daughter whatever is fat and making excuses for not parenting"
1,"We rolled up to the state fair on a fine Sunday afternoon.  I was well hydrated and ready for an evening of debauchery involving barnyard animals, deep fried GARBAGE, shitty domestic beer in a plastic cup, and \""amusement\"" rides.  Zed and Nickels were on the buddy system, I was their backup buddy, the third wheel on the tricycle of fun, 3-dub for short.\n\nIs it sad that the best thing I can say about the State Fair is that with enough beer it becomes tolerable?  I discovered that I am not a big fan of deep fried sweets.  Maybe I'm just not in the right space for it, but most of the food options at the Fair looked uniformly gross.  Nickels went gaga over the bunny rabbits while I had a staring contest with a turkey.  Man turkeys are a lot of ugly to pack into one bird.  I'm not sure I can continue to eat something that ugly, because if you are what you eat, well let's just say it's not going to be pretty and leave it at that.\n\nYou would think the funhouse type attractions would be more fun with a few beers but honestly they just weren't. I wanted them to be, but there was nothing scary or really all that interesting about them.  The sky rail thing was a little fun altough I felt a little silly sitting up there without skis on and you can imagine my disappointment when the ride did not end at the top of a mountain.\n\nWe successfully avoided a Doughtry concert, which made me happy, but there was some sort of frightening pre-teen dance troup trainwreck that we ended up in front of at some point.  We tried to make light of it.  I tried to remember the hilarity of Donnie Darko's little sister's dance troup.  I made a half hearted attempt at telling Zed that sometimes I doubt his commitment to Sparklemotion but it was no use.  Nickels brought up the fact that somewhere in the audience there was probably a pedophile or two taking in the show and it was all down hill from there.  We walked away skeeved out at a society that thinks it's cute to paint up 11 year olds like $10 whores, throw them in sparkly boyshorts, teach them to shake their asses in some semblance of coordinated effort and call it entertainment."
0,"This place has gone so downhill. If I hadnt gotten my chips, salsa & water immediately, I wouldve walked out. Margaritas are always awesome. But the service and food is straight up AWFUL. Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If you're looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."
4,Awesome food prices and great bartenders!
4,"13 to the gallows plays there sometimes, my favorite band. the place is great, cheap drinks and great sound!!"
3,$25 all you can eat sushi. Great food and service. But make sure you watch the amount charged on your credit card before you leave.
0,"Absolutely horrible. Just horrible! If you decide to sign up with this poor excuse for cable or Internet service, be prepared to get a bill for a different and higher amount each month. Top that off with the worst customer service in the industry and more bad reviews than I care to read through and you have COX COMMUNICATIONS! I'd rather just go without than to deal with them. I'd give them zero stars if I could."
2,"Good Shuttle service from the airport at the Southwest terminal. Its the only one that is not cash-only so you can swipe it. The British guy standing around was pretty rude, but the driver was nice. As a rule of thumb, I just take *any* airport shuttle on the return to the airport that just happens to be at the Hotel when I'm leaving."
1,"Thought we would give this place a try in our new neighborhood. Started with spring rolls that were uneatable-the meat tasted rancid and was an off color. Our entrees (beef filet pieces & rice) was just okay. The rice was my favorite part of the whole meal, but it's kind of hard to mess up steamed rice. My partner had the mixed grill (beef, chicken, shrimp) stir fry noodles. It was okay other than very fishy-tasting shrimp. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress standing behind the counter wiping & picking her nose with her hand and not washing them after!!"
1,"If it's not one thing, it's something else. \n\nWent there on a Saturday on my first visit. My friend and I were separated and I didn't want to leave without her. She was talking to a bouncer who asked to talk to a bouncer near me so they could help us coordinate and meet up. Well the bouncer next to me a jerk and wouldn't talk on my phone to help. Finally another bouncer saw us getting into an argument and helped me out. So for the most part, still a fun night. But unusually mean bouncer man, you need to get fired. He's shorter than most girls and does nothing but look mean all night. Power trip? I think yes. \n\nSecond time I go there is on a Friday night. Granted we got free drinks. No one was under the age of 35. Nothing's wrong with that, just not my crowd. Not a lot of dancing, more drinking. The evil bouncer was there again, looking just as miserable as he did the last time I was there. \n\nOne plus side was, they had really good music playing both nights. If you just want to kick it, maybe this place is for you. But if you want the wild and crazy Vegas night, XS or Marquee would probably be better."

Le service \u00e0 table \u00e9tait bon par contre on a du attendre un bon 30 minutes avant d'avoir nos entr\u00e9es. Je ne le conseille pas pour un d\u00eener rapide en semaine. \nC\u00f4t\u00e9 propret\u00e9 c'est pas tr\u00e8s fort non plus, \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9e il y avait de la poussi\u00e8re tomb\u00e9e du plafond et du mur directement sur la table. Je donnera 2.5 sur 5 car malgr\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9gatifs, la nourriture \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bonne."
0,"Been going to this location for over a year now  Last week i ordered griled chicken breast on rye bread. They brought it to me on regular bun. I noticed human hair on the chicken. Thats gross! I could have a big seen but i didnt in front of his customers.\nToday it was brezzy do i took my mccaw, into store. Ordered the same sandwich as last week again they could not get it right the first time. Then the mgr comes to my table and says my bird cannot be in the store. I told him i wanted my money back. And that i would never return to his resturant  . This owner discrimated against a 2.5 lb animal that brings smiles to countlesss people everyday. He wasnt hurting anybody. \nThis proprietor, was extremely condensending,rude & obnoxious. \nShame on Freedies Custard on Eastern Ave Las Vegas, NV."
4,This place is amazing. The food is what I would say is very authentic tasting food with the right balance of flavor and heat. I had to order the signature dish and I was not disappointed....The Molcajeta come out ripping hot.. it was explained to me in english and spanish since when I go to spanish speaking establishment they are not to sure which languages to speak... either way is ok with me and the occasional spanglish... The dish will feed two people for sure. The seating was a little tricky it was Sunday and it was packed the mariachi group was playing and families where waiting to be seated but after about ten minutes of waiting I was seated. I am sure if you go early you can avoid this type of situation..The staff was really helpful with getting pople in and out.\n\nIf you are in Las Vegas and enjoy venturing out beyond the buffets....This is the place for authentic flavor of Mexico....
0,"Horrible service, I was thinking the were discriminating but after I seen these reviews there just plain horrible! There service is the worst ever and they do not care probably because they get complaints all the time"
4,Ribeye al conacac... The best ...!!
4,"3 words\n\nBacon Wrapped Jalape\u00f1os \n\nI discovered this place because the heath inspector told me it was the best barbecue in the city. So the guy that goes everywhere endorses your place, you listen"
2,"Great selection, various luxury makeup brands, but the SERVICE could improve. Service is a hit or miss, they often look at you and depending on that try to approach you. Sorry, but ignoring a customer isn't they way to go!  You could always fake a hello, it doesn't hurt anyone!  :)   On the positive side, good point system and good samples."
3,"The lobster roll was so yummy I actually finished the whole thing! Had a bite of the sliders my girlfriend ordered and it was also very tasty.  My fianc\u00e9 ordered the prime beef, he didn't enjoy it as much as he has hoped.. It was a little bland and chewy. Standard quality cocktails, nothing to write home about. Overall satisfactory dining experience."
3,"China Chili is not only a 4, it is a very solid 4. I was on my way back to the West Valley, from the East Valley, and did a search on my beloved Yelp for a highly rated Chinese Food joint that was on the way. China Chili kept appearing. We called in the take out order, and it was finished before I arrived. \n\nWe ordered the House Chicken, Spicy Garlic Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Shrimp. And... BAM! It was bomb!\n\nThe House Chicken was delicious. Garlic-y, with little bit of spicyness to it, and a very subtle nuttyness to it from the oil in the wok. Great texture, great smell... It was fantastic.\n\nI'm not an Eggplant fan, but my gf is, and she ordered it. She said the Eggplant was a 3.5. Good, but not the best she'd ever had.   \n\nThe Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.\n\nMongolian Beef. NOM NOM! Perfect. Great flavor, great texture. Very happy with the dish. \n\nThe Breaded Shrimp was perfect. I can only handle so much fried shrimp. Tried one, and it was spot on. \n\nThis was a perfect way to end a 15 hour day."
4,Love this place. Great breakfast for $4.99. I always get the crescent breakfast sandwich which is delicious.
4,Spak Brothers is the best pizza shop in the city. The wing sauces are incredible! Great people own the place and it's very easy to support.
0,SLOW AS FUCK. Don't come here unless you are not hungry. Food takes forever. Great place if you want to drink beer and watch TV and not eat
3,"Headed to Rubio's for the first time, and I was very pleased.\n\nI ordered the California Bowl w/ chicken.  It was pretty good.  Would I eat it over Chipotle? No, but c'mon there's no \""fast food\"" place that beats Chipotle.\n\nThe one thing that I LOVE about Rubio's is their salsa bar.  They had 6 different kinds of unlimited salsa!  I don't know about you, but when it comes to salsa, I'm a massive scooper not a petite little dipper.  I like as much salsa as possible with each bite and their unlimited selection suited my preferences perfectly, and the variety was great as well.\n\nI'll definitely be back because it seems that they are more well known for their seafood dishes like fish tacos.  I'll head back and give those a whirl when I get some time."
1,"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I give it two stars because everyone I've encountered on the staff is super nice.\nBut the food is not good. We got they gyros for lunch once and there were pretty terrible. The meat came in giant, hard to chew and (size-wise) hard to handle chunks. A few nights ago, we decided to give it another go, mainly because we had a gift certificate. I like that they deliver within a 5-mile radius. However, they do not have this part together at all. We ordered a pasta, greek salad and soup. They forgot the soup. I called them and they apologized and said \""the driver is on his way back.\"" Well he must have gotten lost, because he never showed up and therefore I never got my soup.\nI don't believe this restaurant will last.\nOh and neither my husband or I really enjoyed either the salad or the pasta. It was just ok."
2,"In real life this place is a 3.5, but I definitely would say it rounds down to a three for Yelp purposes. \n\nThe music was great on Saturday: chill, talented, smooth - made for an excellent double type type atmosphere. Lots of people, but not too crowded, meaning we were able to carry on conversations and listen to fine jazz without yelling or feeling like we were interrupting the performance. \n\nUnfortunately, this place only felt the need to operate with one bartender, resulting in snail-esque service speeds. Also, orders coming in from the servers took priority over mine, even after the drinks were partially made, which pulled me away from my group and made me quite thirsty, both being awful occurrences. The bartender had a lassez-faire attitude while the servers had a gruff and hurried demeanor, definitely drawing away from the overall chill attitude of the place. \n\nI liked the atmosphere enough that I would go back for another try, but if the service was that poor again I would probably avoid a third attempt and decide to spend my two-drink cost of $16 on a bottle of liquor, make my own drinks, light some candles, and change the TV to BET Jazz - wasting 13 minutes twice in the same night away from my date waiting for drinks is not the way to create a good post-bar atmosphere."
3,"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because both times I have gone to the Mesa office to see Dr. Peterson, my wait time has been almost inappropriately long.  Last time, I waited 50 minutes past my appointment time before I was seen.  I understand that doctor's get behind, but it would have been nice for someone to have acknowledged that I was still there waiting, rather than having to get up and ask about the wait time. \nBut, Dr. Peterson is great.  He's friendly, and explains everything so that I could understand what he was talking about.  He gave treatment options and didn't pressure me to do anything beyond my cost or comfort zone.  I definitely recommend him."
2,"Food -  We ordered Onion Soup, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad and Beef Bordelaise. \nOnion Soup - was OK but a bit on the salty side. Generous portion and definitely was not stingy on the onions. The beef stock was salty and does not have that rich buttery aroma to it.\n\nFrisee & Warm Bacon Salad - It was light and refreshing. It was simple yet delicious. The soft-poached egg mixed nicely with the citrus vinaigrette. The portion is on the small side.\n\nBeef Bordelaise - Steak was nicely prepared - medium rare as we have asked for. The potato chips on the side was impressive but a bit too salty to eat alone. \n\nAmbience - Will definitely ask for an outdoor seat next time. The lights for the indoor seating was poor and not suitable for taking \""foodie\"" pictures :P"
1,"To avoid the pouring rain, we ran into this place to have a drink.  I got a dirty martini and my friend got some fruity drink.  I was unimpressed.  My martini glass was tiny and it was barely halfway full.  There was literally 2 spoonfuls of liquid in that tiny glass.  That would have been okay for $9 if I were surrounded by hot bodies in tight shirts dancing on white sofas.  In which case the goddamn drink woulda been free.  But this ain't Hollywood honey.  When I pay $9 for a drink I expect more than an eyedropper's worth."
1,"To me this place wasn't that great. I ordered a two piece catfish and the batter was super thick, staff were inattentive and no where to be found. It seemed pretty popular as the parking lot was full. I didn't even eat half my meal before I got a little disgusted for spending the money and hopped up to toss the mess in the trash. I'll pass and stick to Pete's Fish and Chips!"
3,"The family went to Frank & Fina's for the first time last Friday night. We arrived at 7pm and we were greeted by a friendly hostess who informed us that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table. FYI - They do take reservations if you call before 5pm the same day. \n     After getting seated, we were immediately welcomed by our waiter and asked what we'd like to drink. When the older gentleman returned with the drinks we were given the specials of the night. I ordered the Steak Milanesa (thinly sliced steak that is breaded) which is also served with your choice of tortillas, rice and beans. Our table also ordered an appetizer of guacamole and some melted cheese dish topped with green chiles, chorizo, and salsa fresca. The guacamole was tasty and had big chunks of tomato. The cheese dish was over the top delicious! We didn't realize it came with tortillas, so we ate it with chips. \n      My Steak Milanesa was tasty. The meat was moist and I felt like I could cut it with my the side of my fork. The beans were refried pinto beans and they were served in a crunchy tortilla bowl and then topped with a sprinkle of Mexican cheese. The rice was a bit dry for my liking. \n     I will most definitely return to Frank & Fina's Cocina. The atmosphere is welcoming, the prices are good, and the food portions will definitely fill your belly. What really set this place apart was the personal touch the wait staff added. They were quick with recommendations, and we even got served by Frank himself!"
3,"Very friendly, very helpful and close to my home.  If they weren't jabbing me with needles every week I'd give them five stars."
4,We had a great experience here! Wonderful western decor inside and out. This was their 6th Anniversary celebration so they were blowing up tons of balloons. They brought a basket of bread with mini corn muffins and dinner rolls before the meal. My spouse ordered the French Dip and I had the Chicken pizza. His sandwich was served hot and stuffed with meat. He liked the sweet potato fries and marshmallow cinnamon dip. We both had passion tea. My pizza was made fresh and was a true artisan pizza. Very unique. It was our first time in so we were treated to cotton candy (cherry cheesecake flavor) for dessert which is quite a nice and different added touch. The portions are large so we took boxes home. Our server was Steve and he was very attentive. The manager came by and introduced himself. The place wasn't busy but there were people coming and going. Priced at about $20-30 per person depending on what is ordered. We would recommend this place to our friends & look forward to returning. No complaints means 5 stars!
3,"This place has a pool with a clear floor. AMAZING. You can see straight down to the... parking entrance. Hilarious. The pool is pretty tiny - entirely for relaxing, no exercise here. \n\nThe usual Westin bed, Westin service (even for we F1 fans, not staff) were excellent.    Mandatory valet parking with excellently quick service and attentive desk staff. Pristine bathrooms and arranged essentials."
1,"Went to check this place out, as it sounded interesting...  Sat outside on the patio, not to many people there.   Someone came over and said they would be back.  20 minutes later it was the same woman.  She \""forgot about us\"" she said...  The pizza was ok, the antipasto was not good at all.    The pizza came out first, it was cold, then meatballs and salad.  \n\nIt is in the same spot as the Gelato Spot.    Bring back the Gelato!  There are several other places like this in the area.  They won't last in my opinion."
1,"Never again!!\nNobody acknowledges your arrival and you are left kind of hanging at the front door (please wait to be seated sign) until someone finally notices that you are waiting and yells from behind the counter to take a seat anywhere. \nIt took 10 minutes to even get a beer ordered (bottled Hoffbrau at $8 for a half liter-ouch, and no imported draft).\nThe uninspired menu is WAY overpriced for the mediocre quality even if the portions are ample, who cares to eat a bunch of slop.\nI've lived and traveled throughout Germany and this restaurant with an owner who obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction wouldn't survive for 1 year.\nI guess if I want to eat German food again in Las Vegas I would have to opt for the Hoffbrau Haus Las Vegas.\nGo to Cafe Heidelberg at your own risk-you will most likely be disappointed and overcharged.\nCaveat Emptor"
2,"This Post Office is okay.  No automated machines.  Huge parking lot.  Located near a Food Lion,Goodwill,and a Hess gas station.  The employees are decent and somewhat polite.  If you don't feel like waiting in a huge line then this would be the Post Office to drive too."
3,"Always enjoy our visits to RA. Our party of six arrived early afternoon. The restaurant was fairly slow,  we were seated quickly and greeted very friendly by Tiffany. \n\nWe ordered edamame, steamed and RA chips and salsa (tuna tartar with salsa and avocado served with wonton chips). \n\nWe were unsure of what to drink and Tiffany recommended White Sake Sangria. What a great recommendation!\n\nOur group shared udon noodles, Las Vegas roll, crispy tuna roll and two California rolls for the kids. \n\nWe really enjoy the atmosphere and grooving music to dance to with the kids!  Each meal is really fun because we mix it up and don't go in with any preconceived notions and our kids love it."
4,"First time here, and I must say they have great pastries. You can taste the quality of  ingredients i.e the strawberries or real vanilla bean. Look forward to our next visit."
1,"This place was said to be \""busy\"", so I made sure to arrive before opening time at 11 AM, expecting a long line outside such as I would have found at Matt's or Five Guys.  Instead, there was no one else, & that was still the case at 11:05, when the door was still locked, the dining room dark, & the \""Open\"" sign in the window off.\n\nFiguring they had gone out of business, I started my car to drive away, but just then the \""Open\"" sign lighted (although the dining room remained unlighted during my visit).  I found a table with enough light to read the magazine I had brought along, but then loud music started playing, so I couldn't hear myself think anyway, & it played during my entire visit.\n\nThere were a variety of tacos offered, & a combo including two tacos plus rice & beans was priced ok at $6.99.  \""Vanessa\"" brought me a basket of chips & took my order for a Combo with a dogfish shark taco & a Carne Asada one.  There were an array of salsas available on an iced table, & I tried several of them with the chips while I waited for the main items.  The chips were blah, but the salsas were good, especially the green Cilantro one.\n\nThe rest of the food was ok too, but it would have been more enjoyable if it hadn't been for the blaring music.  Forty minutes after I had arrived, I went up to the counter to pay, & one other customer finally entered the restaurant.  So much for it being a busy place.\n\nWham!  Instead of $6.99, I am being charged $8.79!  What's this?  Vanessa points out to me that in tiny print at the bottom of the menu it says that if your two tacos aren't the same as each other, then it's $8.79.  That's too much for what it was.\n\nBack home, I looked at La Condesa's menu on their Website.  There, they do tell you up at the top that they will charge you extra for two different tacos, but the new higher price shown there is $7.59, not $8.79.\n\nToo many problems here, & I'll never return, but since the food itself was pretty good, I'll bring it up to 2-Stars.    :-("
3,"I'm in love with Panini... wish we had one in LA. The food is AMAZING.  Our server was really nice too.  The menu is enormous, but every time I've gone I have loved my dish.  The only negative... theyre closed on saturday nights... Come on Vegas... you really need to work on having something kosher open on a saturday night!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Long wait for food. Food arrived cold. Disorganized waitstaff. Nice patio but I can get that at home. Go to Firehouse Subs. It's just down the way...
3,"I wrote an unfavorable review of Elements back in 2010. I am pleased to report that I gave the place another try last night and was extremely pleased with this place! I do believe the layout of the place has changed as it is now very inviting and comfortable, especially sitting at the bar. Speaking of the bar, the 'tenders were two of the most welcoming and friendly people. They had jokes for days and poured a good drink. The suggested tapas were excellent. We're looking forward to coming back on Sunday for their bottomless Bloody Marys that Carla remarked she made a gr8 one. From what I have read below they may have changed owners which could have made the difference? Either way, I'm glad I left my mind open to try this place again. Thanks"
3,"As usual, I'll dissent a little!  I like this place a lot.  My friend and I have started making this our usual pre-Suns-game stop, and I expect that tradition will continue into baseball season, as well.\n\nI think the pizza has been quite good the two times we've been there.  Granted, I am not at all pretentious about pizza, and think Pizzeria Bianco is a bit of a snobby joke with a great marketing plan.  So give me a big greasy, pepperoni-covered slice that I can fold in half and I am good to go.  \n\nThe beer (Mich Ultra or Bud Light only) is $10 a pitcher.  How can you go wrong, especially with the beer prices at US Airways or Chase Field?  Granted, it's not high-end craft beer, but it's TEN BLOODY DOLLARS.  Hell, bring me two!\n\nI like the owner, in contrast to some of the other comments.  The guy cracks me up.  Some folks came in and breezed right by the \""Order Here\"" sign and started yapping at him.  He walked over to the sign, flicked it with his finger and said, \""Sign says order here.\""  Excellent!  And when he closed just prior to the Suns game, some people snuck in and ordered, then tried to haggle on the price since it was closing time.  Owner says, \""Hey, I'm already feeding ya after closing time.  Now ya want a deal, too?\""  I love this guy!\n\nAnyway, I think this is a fun place with some personality.  Great place to grab a slice or two and a pitcher before a game.  You pizza connoisseurs can wait three hours for a pie at Bianco.  I shall wait for you at Brooklyn with a full stomach and second pitcher, as I blissfully watch the sports fans go by."
3,"I think this place is great. It's a unique little spot. However, some of these reviews are expecting too much. First, you're going for a $10 wine tasting for five wines, you shouldn't expect Opus One. The wines are priced appropriately and the concept of bottling parties is such a great idea for an event. Also, 'carry & go' is a perfect idea in this area. \n\nThe wines are not offensive. If you are a wine connoisseur, then you will appreciate that these are young wines, but typically are pleasing to the palate. \n\nI have always found the staff to be extremely friendly. Also, I agree with Gabbi, that they get props for being doggie friendly!!"
3,"Teriyaki chicken with soba noodles! That's what I get every time... It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall! The food is cooked up on a big grill in front of you (with a bit of performance usually thrown in by the cooks ~ \""yummy, yummy chickeeen!\""), so depending on the rotation of the chicken, you may have to wait 10 minutes or so for the chicken (or steak, I guess) to cook up. That's fine, as it's worth the wait for fresh food. The teriyaki chicken comes with some traditional veggies ~ bok choy, I think ~ and a very light sauce. However, they do use some vegetable oil, so don't expect this to be the lightest meal you've ever eaten. Surprisingly, I found some threads on the web of people dying to reproduce the recipe, so I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys Sarku every so often!\n\nOh, by the way, lots of folks get double meat, but with the soba, I might go into a comatose state if I tried that one, so I just get the regular meat portion. It is PLENTY.\n\nP.S. I've heard you can do double veggie instead of the rice normally served with the teriyaki. I might try that, but it's hard to say \""No\"" to soba noodles. : ("
3,"The modern atmosphere is good for a date night or just hanging out with friends. This place has traditional sushi as well as very unique choices (as the name would suggest). My favorite is definitely the Fusion Maki though it is a little pricey. I definitely think it's worth the price because it's a meal in itself. Also, they have a great $1 sushi deal on Sundays and Mondays. The menu is a little pricey though if you're not going on their $1 sushi nights."
2,Very friendly staff. Always clean.\n\nMy only complaint is that it seems to be Hobo-Town in this neighborhood. You almost have to run to your car.
0,"Got this \""deal\"" on Travel Zoo for $135 - \""normally $220.\""  A horrible joke.  Supposedly a five course meal.  I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the \""scallops\"" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the \""annex\"" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!  Avoid this scam at all cost!"
4,"Go Cupcakes! Cupcrazed, I love you so much I want to marry you. You have a cute store, you have cushy nooks to sit in, you have pretty little dishes to eat off of, you are in sweet little Baxter, and your cupcakes are PERFECT.  My daughter had the red velvet (moist, chocolatey and the icing had the great sweet/sour taste of the cream cheese that it should). I had the lemon cupcake, which was nice and lemony and wonderifically moist.  I will make the drive from Charlotte to visit you again!"
0,"I agree with Kristen.    I was there with my girlfriend, who is a bridesmaid in my sisters wedding, and the owner was very condesending about an issue my girlfriend had.   While it wasn't a big issue, we were talked down to and made to feel like idiots.    I recommend going any other shop where they will be happy to help you, and make you feel special for your special occassion, and you will not have any issues, glitches, or wrong dress sizes."
4,"This is a hidden gem for sure!  Everything from the service, atmosphere, food innovation and taste, home run!  The owner personally introduced himself to us, the service (front and back of the house) was educated, informative, attentive, and passionate.  Very cool, romantic or lounge type vibe to the area.  Food was very creative.  Pizzas are outstanding.  The attention to details in flavor profile was on point too.  I had the chicken marsala and that extra flare of Grand Marnier in there adding the citrus notes was on point!  I'm scared to tell the world about this place b/c I want to be able to get a table any time I want!  :)"
1,Poor guest service. If ur looking for service with an attitude this is ur spot. Won't be coming to this location again.
4,Great prices and friendly staff!
2,"II Pizzaiolo has long been on my radar as a new place to try.  Who doesn't love a little Italian?  (Well, I divorced one, but that's a whole 'nother story not fit for Yelp).  So, when I got the chance to show up here, I was very excited!\n\nWe made a reservation for a weekend afternoon, so not necessary, BTW.  The interior is shall we say cozy?  We got our pick of tables.  Service was meh.  Our service acted bored until we mentioned that this was our first visit, then we were given her high energy sales pitch, \""delicious food created using old-world techniques and the high quality ingredients.  Most menu items are hand-made and if they are not, they are imported from the best sources\"".  Did she forget anything?  I hope not!  Wait, there is more, \""the mozzarella is direct from Naples\"".  That's more like it, gf, show some enthusiam!\n\nLots of great choices on the menu!  BJ got the Chicken Cacciatore and I got the lasgana.  Our server warned us of the extra wait time for my meal.  No problem, I was willing to wait for this classic homemade dish!  Unfortunately, it did to live up to my expectations.  First off, it was served lukewarm.  Back to the oven for my dish!  It was a little better the second time around.  Nothing special about the sauce or meat.  BJ liked his dish, too.  But really nothing special.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  But we had nothing that we would make us want to go back."
1,"A group of us had breakfast here one morning and I thought the prices were ridiculous. \n\nI should have looked at the prices, but didn't think orange juice was going to cost $7! Yes, a glass of orange juice was $7. It didn't taste fresh squeezed or had anything special in it? Was this juice mixed by David Copperfield? Were the oranges grown by Celine Dion? Who knows?? Along with this magical orange juice, I had the BB King Breakfast plate, which came with 2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 meat patties, 2 bacon and 2 pancakes. I ordered a side of hash browns as well and no, I wasn't able to finish it. The hash browns were super oily, the eggs were slightly undercooked, but the pancakes were delicious. \n\nBreakfast ended up costing me $31. I should have went to the Bellagio buffet for $16 all you can eat instead. Ah well, what can you do... now I know not to eat here in the future."
4,"Rooms were nice and spacious, very clean, across the street is a 24 hour walgreens so if you need anything you can get it at anytime. A lot of beggers in this area around the streets and on the bridges though."
4,"I can't believe I'm about to say this but, Poppy Seeds Bagels are FABULOUS!! They are good in every way! They Really do taste like they are from NY!! \n\nIt's a far drive from NODA but its a good thing my sister decided to move to the middle of nowhere because otherwise I would have never been able to try these never mind even hear about this place!\n\nYou walk in and they have baked deliciousness staring right at you along with all of they're homemade Cream Cheese! A lot of different flavors from Regular to Jalape\u00f1o. They seem to get really busy just while we were there on Monday morning at around 7:30 am the line began to go out the door! Stallings is very lucky I can't wait for more Poppy Seeds to open closer to me! Please?!"
4,"hands down, the best dog park i have been to so far! lots of room, trees, water fountains, good owners, tennis balls galore... what more can a dog want?\n\nnot to mention it has an actual people park as well, where the kids can play. the playground is right outside of the dog park for your kids... \n\n5 stars, awesome bark park..."
0,"Oh also I have been trying to reach the managers for a week now, I tried 2 different managers multiple times and have left 4 voicemails with absolutely no response! So of you do stay here, do so at your own risk because if they start randomly charging your credit card hundreds of dollars like they did mine (and blaming it on \""computer glitches) don't expect their help to fix it!"
0,"Seriously worst waxing experience ever. I usually get my eye brows done when I get my nails done.. nothing to fancy its cheap and they do a pretty good damn job. So when my mom told me about the European wax center I was a bit hesitant, I'm comfortable at my nail salon however the first time you go it is free and my mom got 5 buck in her account for referring me so why not? Anyway so I mean its clearly says that this facility is a waxing center, they don't offer any other services you would think that the staff would be pro's however I'm unsure if the red headed girl I had was new which I don't think she was because as soon as I was done she happily greeted another customer by name before the receptionist gave her the form.  So I go into one of the waxing rooms she tells my about the wax how this place is the only one in the world that uses it (well maybe there is a reason) It did not work very well or maybe it does and she just didn't so a sufficient job. So she waxed me trimmed my eyes brows  then gave me a mirror to check it out.. I asked if she was gonna trim my eyebrows and the little snob says very rudely \""I already did\"" when I'm looking directly in the mirror and I can see that my eyebrows hardly even looked cleaned up. I had to have her re do them 3 times and by the third I was fed up and just left went home and finished the damn thing myself. I was not satisfied at all the only good experience about this place was the girl at the front desk. Not to mention the apparently they have a 9 minute no show rule my appointment was at 4:15pm she was not ready until 4:28pm, I will not recommend this place to anyone I had an awful experience and I will not return. Very disappointed considering this place specialize's in waxing."
1,"All the buffets at the various Station buffets are not equal. The food offerings at the Feast Buffet at the Palace Station are no where near as extensive or as well prepared as the buffet at Boulder Station or Sunset Station even though the prices are all the same. So if you are thinking of eating here, instead consider the buffet at one of Station's other properties."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! Worst customer service EVER! I paid to go thru the car wash TWICE...when I got done..my car had just as many bugs on the front of it along with dirt as though I had not even gone through. Needless to say I was not happy. I asked a manager to come look and he told me that that there was nothing he could do because I didn't buy their expensive wash. I asked if I could at least have one of the paper towels they give out to try and wipe the bugs off. He said 'No', those were for people who bought the $5 wash. I was like really, I just paid $6 and you won't give me one. 'No, nothing I can do to help you.' REALLY?  Guess I'll just use the free vacuums and get washed elsewhere."
3,"My go to place to watch any game. You can always find dogs on the patio too. Service is great, but the food can be hit or miss."
0,"Not all Taco Bells are the same. I don't know what has changed in the last year or so, but this location is soooo sloooow. Several times I have had to wait 15 minutes in the drive thru after placing my order when there were two cars ahead of me. Today, I ordered a mexican pizza and a potato soft taco and they were both tasting of stale oil. Potatos were dry too. I give up on this location."
3,"Well done! Had a delicious, full of flavor dinner and great customer service. We will be coming back"
4,absolutely wonderful --- it's huge -- there's all kinds of awesome foods for sampling and purchase... I left with about 10 lbs of various cheeses -- all the samples from all the vendors were awesome -- it wore me down walking the entire market...\n\nwill absolutely visit again
2,Here with my family. Kids meals were huge and fit for an adult. Wife ordered chicken flautas and they were a little bland. I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with red sauce... It was good.  They were generous portions on everything. Chips and salsa were ok. The environment was was nice old world Mexico and the service was good! We will be back.
2,"This was my first time here. After reading all these bad review I was kinda iffy in having dinner here. A lot of the reviews are about service. To be honest service was pretty good. Very friendly staff, food didn't take that long and presentation of the food wasn't that bad as well. \n\nReason why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars is because of the following: \n-Tai Tea drink was very yummy but the boba's were very hard\n-They only had 1 working high chair in the whole restaurant \n-It being a Filipino restaurant, you should know Filipino's eat a lot of rice. We ordered 5 dishes and they gave us only 5 scoops of rice for a party of 5 adults + 2 kids. We asked for more rice and to find out on our tab, it was $1.99 per scoop. \n-On the menu it says \""15% auto gratuity for a party of 6+\"" they auto gratuity us even when we had 2 kids (2 & 5 years old) to my knowledge in the state of Nevada auto gratuity is not allowed anymore. I didn't complain this time because we would have gave a large tip anyways. \n-some of the TV's need to be changed out.\n\nWhat I did like was they had a private banquet room that fits about 100 people. I might have an event here, still debating, going to base it on cost. I'll update you as soon as I make a decision. \n\nHopes this helps :)"
0,This guy totally bait and switched me. I went in and he told me 50 dollars and I thought that was high so I went and called my insurance to see if it would be cheaper to just get new frames. I went back in and said ok I will do it. Then I pulled out a 10% discount card and then he told me 69 but he will do it for 50. I thought that was pretty unethical.  I told him I would pay 45 which would be his orginal quote plus my 10% off. He refused.
3,"I went here for a birthday celebration - for ME of course! It was excellent! Our server was completely fantastic, and even though I really disliked the drink she recommended (the honey lemon ginger with rum), her upbeat attitude was totally worth it. \n\nI'm #glutenfree and went with a pescatarian/no-cow-dairy-eating-person, so we are a match made in heaven for horrible ordering. I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. She ordered the shrimp goat cheese pizza. I love the menu, because it spells out the ingredients (which are all pretty simple - the whole appeal of the natural hippie simple recipe theme) and lists if it's vegetarian and gluten free. The casserole was SO delicious, I would totally go back once a week to eat that! My girlfriend's order came back with cheese on the pizza, although it wasn't listed. The waitress gladly remade the pizza and apologized. See, I told you she was great! \n\nThey also serve Dos Cabezas wine here - a fantastic winery in Sonoita, AZ. I suggest you get a glass when you go there. They are fantastic people and I love supporting local wineries! I had the rasberry sorbet for dessert and the pomegranate seeds really took it to a whole different level.\n\nThis place is brilliant, but I'd love to try it again to see if everything else is worthy of five-stars. I hope that the rest of the wait staff is as awesome as the server we had. It's not cheap by any means, but it's worth it if you want TRUE food :)"
1,"Vastly different experience than the Keg that is in Old Montreal.\n\nSteak undercooked, potato overcooked. Not a good combination."
4,"I finally returned and I am glad that I did. The off putting smell of eggs upon entering is no longer there. The service was extremely attentive and efficient. We were seated immediately and our drinks came out quickly. The server was pleasant and professional. I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger and we shared the oxtail chili cheese fries appetizer. We cleaned our plates! The burger was so much better than I remember, and it appears that some positive changes were implemented since my last visit over six months ago. Another great local business to add back to my list of neighborhood favorites!"
4,"This place was great! I come from LA so I was afraid I would end up at in n out type of place just so they can get me out, but to my surprise this place was actually awesome. Customer service fantastic, I got what  I wanted, simple but vegasy. They have tons of colors and designs to choose from. Very happy customer!"
1,"Yes, it's a Las Vegas Buffet - Food here is meh - basically, low quality food with emphasis of quantity. It is pretty pricy considering what you're getting - traditional Vegas up charge, but I still think it's still a bit pricy, even by Vegas Standards. \n\nMe, I just had a couple of eggs, canned fruit, and a bowl of cereal. Personally in the future, if I have to eat on the cheap and quick - I would suggest considering a coffee shop oatmeal, fruit, and coffee. Or if you want to spend the budget - consider eating a famous French place that is listed in my Vegas list."
3,"Nordstrom is most convenient department store across the States.   I always stop there and check it out when I go down to the States.\n\nI like to shop at Nordstrom coz of their friendly service and casual atmosphere in the store.  From cosmetic to clothing, they have good selection and nice customer service.\n\nSurprisingly quiet on weekday at Nordstrom, I just saw few customers on cosmetic floor.   That's ok. I liked to enjoy private sales service and atmosphere."
1,"In my mind, there is one reason to not instantly veto any trip to Pedro's: the free fresh tortillas for the table.\n\nThere's not really a reason to go to Pedro's, but I'm actually confident in my ability to find something edible on the menu now after a recent trip. I had a burrito (uuuh...top right column) that was reasonably decent (surprisingly so, actually) keeping in mind my rock bottom expectations."
1,"I was born really close to the Mexican border so when I heard this was the best Mexican place in town, naturally I had to act fast.\n\nIt's located centrally which is pretty nice - not in the best neighborhood, but easy access to the freeway.\n\nI should've known that this place was going to be a disaster from they're chips and salsa. One salsa was way too spicy and the other tasted like tomato sauce. \n\nWhen our food arrived (after a good wait) my guacamole had a fowl, spoiled taste and my mom's steak was rare. We sent both plates back (which I never do) and my second plate came equipped with beef instead of the chicken I order. Besides that, the food was just mediocre. The beans were too salty, and the meat was under-seasoned. \n\nPrices are reasonable for a sit down joint, but you can honestly get better food a Roberto's. Skip this one!"
3,A fun selection of children's clothing and some of the more unusual (and pricey) accessories.  This is one of the only places I've seen dinosaur stuffed animals.
1,"Disappointing. \n\nMaybe it was because we were there for Restaurant Week, but the options were all overly simple (could have made all of it in under half an hour no problem) ,small, and somewhat bland. Not what I expected from an upscale place.\n\nFirst, our salad was just greens pretty much, and my boyfriend's shepards pie was small and tasteless.  My chicken was tender and well-cooked, but it was supposed to come with Mushroom sauce, of which I spotted about two drops.  Both of our deserts (apple crisp and chocolate almond cake) would have been better warmed up and mine had a weird after-taste of cherry cough-syrup.\n\nThe portions were extremely small too.  I can usually eat about half of a Wisconsin-sized dinner entree and here I ate the whole thing and was still hungry.  I know it's supposed to be a good deal, (for restaurant week), but not if they're portions are for babies.\n\nThe pluses include romantic ambiance and good service (my water was never empty - an undervalued part of a good dining experience).  Also - the chicken...so tender (but still so plain!). \n\nBut, I don't think I'm coming back any time soon."
3,"I went on a weekday during Arizona Restaurant week.  The food was fantastic - classic food done really well (rack of lamb) or new twist on a familiar dish (sweet potato gnocchi with chorizo).  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  The wine flight was excellent.  The only subpar dish was the dessert  - prepared in individual servings resulted in the bread pudding becoming rather dry, however the flavors were quite nice.\nI can't wait to try their brunch."
3,"I wasn't a big fan of wings until I had the lemon pepper wings from Wing Stop.  I love the fact that they naked fry their wings.  I don't like the heavy battered wings.  Yuck.  Back in Houston, I would eat those wings at least once a month.  Honestly, I did not like the fries the few times I had it in the beginning, but I grew quite fond of them.  There must be sugar as one of the ingredient of the seasoning or something.  Whatever it is, I dig.\n\nThe good thing about Wing Stop is that they all make the same delicious wings, from taste to texture.  I have not found a soggy wing yet...and hopefully will never!!!  Anyways, since we were on a time crunch, I put the order in online for dine-in and that was very convenient.  The website is user-friendly too.  When we arrived, our food was ready for our consumption.  The staff were nice. \n\nIf Wing Stop wasn't so far from where I live, I will definitely come back more often."
0,"The selection here sucks. This one is pretty much just a kids store. The only items that were really offered to women were just a few tank tops, and some work out clothes. There was nothing cute. I generally don't shop here, but I went in one day to buy a few gifts for my cousins since they shop here often, and I was not impressed at all. The lines are very long too. I waited for a good chunk of time only to purchase a few items."
3,"7th Street Market is one of my favorite hang outs. There are so many awesome businesses to check out. They have everything- pizza, sandwiches, sushi, desserts/sweets, coffee, cooking salts, and handmade bath products. They have something for everyone here."
1,"The double double was ok, the fries was horrid. They was so bland with no taste and was not cooked all the way. The line was so long, our total wait from entering door to receiving order was approx 45 mins. While in line a group walks in with a ferret on a leash. Letting the nasty thing ponder the floor like they was in there own house.  It is very in appropriate to take a animal into a fast food place, and letting it ponder. There was a whole lot of disquisted people in line, more then one employee seen it and said nothing to them about having it in the restaraunt."
0,"I am a longtime shopper at buffalo exchange and I must say, this location is terrible. Staff is unfriendly, selection is awful & they never seem to buy any of the quality clothing that I bring in. I am done shopping here, completely over it."
1,"The hostesses on St. Patrick's Day were rude little girls.  I would not return based on their attitudes seeing as how they were my first impression of the restaurant and how they treat people.  This was my first and last visit.  With so much competition in that area, there are plenty of other places to choose from where I am sure are more welcoming and less snotty."
3,"Really delish sandwiches, with good balance of flavors and ingredients/bread ratio. It was too big for me to eat alone, so I split one with my bf and we had a salad as well. Super fresh tasting, with a great combo of crispiness and gooeyness."
1,"I had been told this Was am amazing place by a friend w wonderful service.  However when we got there the girl at register was most unfriendly.  She would not smile at all.  I tried making small talk and she was just very cold.  I finally had to ask her if she ever smiled. She was nicer after that. \n\nThe sandwich I had was very delicious. I probably wouldn't return due to service.  The cakes they sold,  chocolates and desserts looked very yummy."
2,"Went here for lunch today. I've been driving past this place for a few years now, so was looking forward to finally trying it. It was good, nothing to write home about though. We had the lunch specials - I had the chicken enchilada with green sauce and rice and beans, my friend had the chicken tacos. Extremely small portions, wow. For $6 a meal, which ok is affordable, and true it's just \""lunch portions\"", I still was expecting more. The enchilada was the size of a tortilla roll-up, like really really small. The tacos were also three tiny lil guys, like maybe only 3 inches long. The taste was just alright too - I mean it was good, but again nothing that's going to make me go back again. \n\nThe service was good, the server was attentive and our drinks kept getting refilled.\n\nSo yea...good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe dinner is better."
4,"If they had Electric Six's \""Gay Bar\"" I would be tempted to play it every time I came. All wise cracks aside and the frequent mentions that this is a gay bar. The Garage is a place that transcends the need to be labeled and is just fun for everyone. No matter if you are GLBT or straight. When the urge to go hang out at a cool bar with cheap drinks, clean facilities, an abundance of games, friendly bartenders, and sports playing on all the TV, this will always be the first choice. You would think it would be difficult to get a bunch of straight guys into this place, but there is never a need to convince them, because it is not a place where people go trolling. \n\nMonday nights are board shorts night offering $1 well drinks and domestic drafts from 9 to midnight. I guess having the cheapest happy hour in town is not enough."
0,"LIARS!!!! Sign said open til 1 am and it was 12:50 and they were still there! My taco bell satisfaction was ripped from me. I thought this was America, taking away my Taco Bell privileges and sh*t. Good thing jack in the box is always here for us and they are nice!!!!!!"
1,I was disappointed that the flavor selection was the same as last week
0,We ordered pizza today for lunch in our dental office.  The doctor was eating and a piece of glass was in the pizza.  They offered to return the money never did.  I don't recommend going to this store.
0,"My gosh, I understand people come here with kids for the atmosphere but can they at least try to make the food taste ok!!!!!\nCame here 7/14/12 to celebrate my kid's bday. This would be our second time here and I was thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch. Anyway, I ordered the sampler: Egg rolls--tasted like dishwashing liquid, mozzarella sticks--bad breading, chicken strips--tasted like kid cuisine nuggets, soggy, horrible breading, no taste, spinich dip--holy crap it was bad. lumps of unmelted cheese, tasted like paste. The only things I enjoyed were the tortilla chips that they probably got out of a bag. My son then received the bday volcano brownie; we only at the ice cream. Duncan hines box mix was better than this crap. Sorry for being so candid but this is ridiculous. The food is HORRID IMO...on top of that we had a less than enthusiastic server. I will never go back to this place!!!\nNo more sparklers on deserts either & all of the animals do not move..."
0,"We went here on a Tuesday morning for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. \n\nWell.... I ordered the special which was a tuna melt. I traditional tuna melt is tuna salad with cheese melted on top and its warm.  My friend ordered steak & eggs. \nMy tuna melt came out as fried tuna without mayo and it was fishy!\n\nSo..... about 15 minutes goes by and someone comes over to my table who appears to be the owner and said we don't have any more steak would you like something else?\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture? WOW REALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOh and did I forgot to mention our waiter was clueless! He stood behind us while we were ordering, he didn't even make eye contact. He also has no clue on how to be a server. \n\nFirst and Last Time at this place!"
4,"Oh Hell yes! This place doesn't fuck around. I assume it's authentic Italian food but I've been to Italy, technically a couple of times, and I never experienced anything this good there except for a $6 scoop of double dark chocolate ice cream in some famous Roman square. \n\nThe food is simply amazing. Three words: Eggplant! That said, your experience is dependent on your ability to engage the owner. He's rad. Magnetic. Talented. Funny. So if you have even a modicum of grace and social disineptness or adeptness you'll do fine. If I was the type of person to do lunches, dinners, or generally engage others in a mutually beneficial exchange of thoughts or ideas, I'd be here all the time."
3,"I love this library. It just keeps getting better. I was actually pretty sad about 5 years ago when the county decided to do budget cut on library hours. This location has the most friendly staff I know of. Amazing selection of book, this location and the downtown location has the best selection out of all the Mecklenburg library branches. \n\nThe kids area has bean bag chairs, play stations, sofas and computers set up to play kids games. I was one of those who relied on the amazing kids CD  games they have here to satisfy my imagination when I was younger haha.\n\nThe upstairs central study area overlooks a magnificent fountain, tell me another's library that has this kind of view. When you get bored of studying, go outside and sit on the lawn by the fountain, it is so relaxing.\n\nThere is a teen section in the second floor, they even break it down by kids, young audit/teens! How nice...two side of the library upstairs, fiction and nonfiction. Both of the areas aside from the main study space have additional study spaces. \n\nHarris teeter is also walking distance from here, right next door. You can go get your Starbucks there or grab a sandwich if you are hungry. \n\nWireless printing, good lighting, ample study space, ample outlets, good book selection, courteous, friendly and helpful staffs. Pretty good people who come here."
2,"Sign up for the ClubVeg coupons. That's the only way this place is a value... Cuz seriously.. WHERE'S THE BEEF? :)  Four stars for the salad bar itself. I've yet to encounter any of the freshness issues.. in fact, everything I've had has been super fresh! Most of their prepared salads are downright tasty, especially the Chicken Won Ton Salad.. a classic! As for the soups, and hot foods, 2 stars, on their best day.  Their soups just aren't that great, and I've tried just about each one... Today the featured soup was lemon orzo and it was absolutely inedible.. Their chicken noodle, is decent, and so is their potato soup, most of the time.. just don't be surprised if you get raw potatoes sometimes. Not uncommon.  They've got a nice selection of carb-tastic breads/pizza type things, which aren't what I'm really there for.. If you're going here to eat healthy, you may as well avoid the hot foods all together. All things considered, the full dinner price, with drink is a bit over $13.00.. The Casino Arizona buffets aren't much more expensive, and neither are the top Asian buffets in the valley. Finally, this place is CRAWLING with some of the most insufferable brats suburbia can offer."
3,"Archis is was one of the better Thai food restaurants in Vegas. I've been going here for years. I usually get the Penang, Thai beef salad, pad kea mow. Can't go wrong with any of those."
3,"Love Mongolian BBQ, Love this place.  Everything is always fresh and has the best varitey of any I have been to.  Would have given it 5 stars if they had the traditional sesame and other cool oils...."
4,"Its been years since Ive been to an Outback and I was so pleasantly surprised how wonderful everything was this evening. My boyfriend and I both got the 4 courses for $15 which is a screaming deal for the amount of food you get! The french onion soup was a $1 up charge but totally worth it. We asked for our steaks medium rare, unaware of how thick an outback special would be. They came more rare than medium rare so I did what I absolutely hate to do, I sent it back. Our server Christopher was so nice about it and seemed more interested in making sure we were actually enjoying our evening. The manager stopped by to apologize (even though it was no one's fault but my own) and told me the steaks would be up in a minute or two. We were so full so Christopher boxed up our desserts for us to go. ALSO! I ordered the skinny rita which was also amazing! very light and refreshing. perfect to start before a 4 course dinner! \nWe will be back because of the food, management, and our awesome server Chris!"
0,"I think we made the mistake of coming here right before closing time, my seafood chowder was too thick and creamy with no flavor, my chicken was cold and flavorless, the sauteed mushrooms felt like they only touched the skillet for a second and my husbands chorizo omelette had about 2 pounds of chorizo in it! Gross! \n\nBad food and bad service ( I even saw a manager wearing shorts), don't come to this location.  Stay far far away!"
2,The service was excellent. Food was hot. It was just your average chicken restaurant.
2,"5 stars for the food. IT was absolutely amazing! The Sandbar had mac n cheese and it was utterly stellar!\n\nAs far as event organization....you had way too much open space and not enough shade. It was miserable outside. When I got my tickets I had planned to be there for 90% of the event. I ended up leaving after 3 hours, and that is after practically drowning myself to stay hydrated. Please plan shade better if you are going to have this event so close to summer next time."
2,"I can't really knock the place but nothing really jumps out and says amazing either. \n\nI have been here multiple times, often for sporting events. The food is good but not fantastic, however it is better than most sports bars. I have had the shepherds pie a few times and I like it. It's a full meal and exactly what you want in a shepherds pie, nothing fancy just the simple classic meal. I have also had the spinach artichoke dip which is pretty much your standard spinach artichoke dip.\n\nThe one of the big things that has this at a 3 star not a 4 star is the lack of pitchers of beer. It's insane that a sports bar doesn't do pitchers of beer. Also during PPV's they don't do any free refills on soda, I really think they should give at least 1 if not 2. Service here has been fair at best. Some have been above average but most have been average at best. I understand it can be busy during sports events but even when there hasn't been anything they haven't been fantastic."
1,"Let me first be clear as to why I gave two stars instead of one. The bartender in the Casino, an older gentleman, was FANTASTIC and the front desk people are really friendly. Now, when we arrived at the hotel we were optimistic because from the outside it looks great. We checked in without any issues and went to our room. This is where the problems started for us. The room was so dusty my boyfriend's asthma was set off within the first 10 minutes. Not only that, but there were hair curlers in the bed, the shower door was broken and the lamp next to the bed has EXPOSED WIRING! We called and req. our room be cleaned and to speak with a manager. The first time I was hung up on, and then they transferred me to the incorrect line, and then I just got the voicemail of someone who never called me back. I wasn't screaming and yelling I was very calm but I was definitely upset. This was a family trip, and all we wanted to do was spend time with our family but instead we had to wait for the maids and the engineer to come and get our room up to par. Also, the lobby smells like a moldy ashtray, and the chicken alfredo at the Tuscany Garden Italian restaurant just tasted like thick warm milk. Three of us had it and we didn't eat it. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I would rather pay more to stay at MGM!"
1,This hotel was ok. It was good value for being in Vegas especially located in the middle of the strip.  The room was not too good.  The beds didn't even come with comforters and at the end of the bed was a rug like thing that was pink.  The bathroom was alright the shower had a little rust in it and there was a soap under the sink and the maids never picked it up while I was there which was disgusting.  The casino part of the hotel was pretty good when you have a low budget where table games start at 5 dollars and blackjack is 10.  You will get some good benefits if you have a platinum total rewards card or higher which can jump the buffet line or get discounts off of the hotel store. Overall this hotel is below average. I probably won't be staying here next time.
4,"At 10:30pm i was craving this : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=t-ZAZpB7Uu2tdh_Wl2VRuA\nCreme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.  If i stayed at the Bellagio or Aria, i know i would have a dozen check ins stocking up on breakfast pastries, chocolate snacks and late night desserts! Danger!"
0,"The physical store is fine.  Ordering from them online is a disaster.  Did not give me the promised 25% discount.  Then I am informed that the order can't be changed or cancelled even when I informed them of THEIR mistake within 2 minutes of it occurring.  Avoid having any online involvement with them at any cost.  I called their 800 number and was informed there were only 2 senior reps that could cancel or change an order if policies permit.  However, those 2 senior reps only work on certain days and hours.  That means that every other rep can only take an order.  The help line can't help you at all.  She was nice enough to tell me that their policies changed recently when I complained, but she wasn't sure how they changed.  Good store, horrible company!"
2,"I came here to find some gingham ribbon and they did have some, but overall, I thought the selection, organization and width of all the ribbons were a bit limited. When I was checking out, you're made to go through a maze of racks so you'll buy more bs impulse items, so needless to say, it's a little confusing of where you're supposed to enter. Well, I entered the wrong way and one of the cashier girls was quick and curt - \""line starts over there!\"" Geeze."
4,I love this zoo and aquarium!
4,"I've had good times and not so good times here, but the good definitely outweighs the bad by far. Last friday I went for happy hour with  a total of 7 friends (one of whom went insanely early in order to save us a table). Arriving at 5:30, I couldn't believe how packed it was! No recession here! I love the music they play- it's just feel-good, trendy pop, but it puts me in to mood to eat, drink and be merry! \n\nI always get the Cowboy roll- which is spicy tuna with cucumbers, spicy sauce and scallions and it just does it for me. For the first time I tried a friend's chimichanga roll and must say that I am now a huge fan! It was even spicier than the cowboy and like a mini party in my mouth! My other fav thing here is the calamari! Its lightly breaded and comes with the best tangy sauce that I always want to keep for later even though I don't know what I would use it for. I'm just a sauce hoarder. And at happy hour an order is only 4 bucks! Beat that? I dont think so. And the specialty rolls are only 8 bucks!\n\nSushi brokers always treats me well and I leave full, buzzed and happy. Just get there early to get a seat for happy hour!"
4,"Wow I love this place! Got the best cut that I've gotten the entire time I've lived in Vegas. ASK FOR NAOMi. She is extremely professional with excellent technique . I know a good bit about cutting hair - for a guy she is too notch and very up to date in the latest styles. Included was shampoo twice, conditioner , paragon hand wax treatment and a facial scrub/massage. $42 plus tip. Setting an appointment through Yelp was a breeze. Don't waste time looking, trust me see Naomi!"
2,"Having been through PHX several times on my way to my favorite spa in Scottsdale, I generally have a good feeling when I arrive (vacation yay!) and not great when I have to leave (back to reality- boo!).  But that's not the airport's fault...\n\nThis airport is pretty easy to navigate- shuttles to a fancy schmancy off-site rental car center are readily available and convenient, though signs are not as prevalent as they could be.  People mover walkways are prevalent in the long walkways connecting areas of the airport.  Since Arizona is very hot, strong air conditioning is important so I notice that it's pretty good, since I feel comfy until the hair dryer-like blast I receive when I walk out the electronic doors to get to the shuttle.  The airport is a little old and dated; gates are not as spacious as they could be for the amount of passengers for each flight, and bathrooms are cramped and have limited space for everyone's rolling bags.  And I cannot find Coke brand beverages (especially Dasani) after security to save my life, or scorched throat.  Gimme some options PHX!"
0,"Bad experience, stay away, you have been warned. Worst VIP hosts in Vegas. I have been coming to Vegas 6-8 times a year for the past 10 plus years so I know the night club game. I know most hosts are snakes but these hosts at Life/SLS take things to a new low. My friends and I stayed at SLS(mistake) and got a cabana Saturday afternoon at the SLS Foxtail pool where we spent about $2000. While we were there a host solicited us about a table at LIFE that evening. He gave us a few options but said he could get us a table for 6 on the dance floor for $3000-$3500, my friend and I discussed it breifly and said we will take it. The host made all the arrangements and we told he we would be there at 11ish after our dinner. We arrived about 11:15 to check in and he then told us the dance floor table would be $5000-$6000....WTF happened to the $3000 table you promised us??? He said we could still do a $3000 table but it was on the second or third tier, totally unacceptable!\n\nWe said no thanks, rounded up the troops and headed over to Marquee where we know we can get a pretty good table in a nice club for $3000. Good job LIFE, keep it up and you will be shuttering your doors closed in no time at all. Stay away people, keep in mind its an $18-$20 cab ride each way from pretty much every property on the strip to the SLS becuase it is out in no mans land on the far north strip.Save that $40 round trip cab ride and play a hand of Blackjack with it, your odds are better at the blackjack table than they are at LIFE."
0,This place is like NEVER open! Are there like secret hours?
0,"Pros:  It's in my neighborhood, food is good (not great) because it's inconsistent.\nCons:  It's too pricey for what you get.  The owner is not customer friendly.  I wanted the chicken scharma with rice but I asked to substitute the pickled peppers and carrots with a scoop of the tabuli salad, he said no.  I offered to pay one dollar more for the scoop, he still said no. I don't get this.  It was such a small amount I can't understand his decision.  He wanted me to pay 3.99 for a small side order.\n\nThis behavior doesn't make me feel valued as a customer, especially since it doesn't make a lot of sense, from a business perspective or human perspective.\n\ni won't go back!"
2,It's fine.  I've been here twice in the last week for breakfast because it was convenient.  Had the oatmeal both times.  It was good.  The second time I was brought out granola bits instead of raisins and didn't care for that so had to ask for the raisins.  Iced tea is good and they are nice enough to give you a cup to go.  \n\nBiggest complaint over the two visits was on the second one a family with three young children was sat directly across from us even though the entire restaurant was almost empty.  Made conversation harder and the kids were fussy.  Why would the hostess do that?!?!
1,"In the past I had tried another place to have some parts re-chromed. 6 weeks later, they hadn't even started the job, so I was willing to try Papago because of my horrible experience with the other spot. This was slightly better, but not by far. I am starting to realize that this type of business plays by it's own rules... Deadline is an unknown word, and on time is a foreign concept. Work was supposed to due on the 20th, and on the 2nd of the next month, I picked up the item the day they called and said it was ready. To boot, the item looked really crappy. The front office was filthy, like it hadn't been cleaned in... OK... Looked like it had never been cleaned. Ever. So, if anyone knows a place for re-chroming, that is reliable, on time, and does a good job, let me know. I'm not holding my breathe!"
4,"If you need a one stop shop for your body this is the place.  I've been in pain for a long long time.  I yelped this place and came in.  Since then I've had adjustments from dr Wasserman, had injections from Jessica the nurse practitioner, massage from Katrina and physical therapy from Yvonne.  I can move around better and the pain had decreased tremendously. They even stopped my chronic headaches.  If your in pain and you want to feel better this is the place.  Everyone here is super friendly and actually care.  You're not just a number.  Try it you'll love it!!"
4,"I'm solely basing this review on the foundation of this establishment, \""the cheese pizza\"".  This cheese pizza by far has to be the best tasting cheese pizza I've come across. The combination of their sauce, the spices and ingredaments in the cheese gives this pizza a MOUTHFULL of flavor with every bite. I wouldn't mind putting extra toppings to give it some more pizazz, but I think it would take away from its' flavorful awesomeness. I'm actually waiting to go pick a cheese pizza up with 50 wings. Cripes I'm hungra... \n\n5 STARS ON THE CHEESE PIZZA YO!!! GREAT SUCCESS!!!\n\nUpdate: I just finished my portion of the pizza. This place is ALWAYS ON POINT!!!\n\nEYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"
2,"Had a groupon and had to try this place out. Jake was our server and he was excellent. We were very pleased, spouse had a ribeye, was a little fatty but good. I had king crab legs, good but I've had better. Cocktails were excellent too."
4,"Delightful Diner!\n\n I've had breakfast at Toast several times, and every time the service has been fast and efficient. I've always enjoyed my meal, as did my boyfriend, and the prices are decent. Its a clean and cute little place, and the hours are very convenient. \n\n On one occasion, I experienced a small but ironic issue: the toast that came with my eggs was not actually toasted (at a restaurant named 'Toast')! I ended up pointing it out to our waiter when he came to give  the bill and ordered a bagel since I had eaten my eggs and was still hungry (great bagel, btw) and let it go. When the manager came to check on how we were doing he sensed my hesitation when I said everything was fine and he insisted I tell him what I was unhappy about. The manager sincerely wants everyone to be completely satisfied with their meal, and his genuine concern for my small issue made me feel like a valued customer (he discounted the bill and apologized for the ironic flaw). \n\nTry it for yourself. As far as breakfast places go, I think it's wonderful :)"
2,Came here before a Coyotes game. Friendly staff and quick seating. Portions are good but over priced $$$... somewhat expected that being so close to the arena.
0,Never again.  When we first got there we saw dried light poop water splatters all over the toilet... inside and out.  We also saw menstrual blood on the seat and front of the bowl.  Called house keeping to clean and they a one-swipe shitty job.  The disgusting leftovers from the previous users were still there.\nSave your money and go somewhere else.  I've been to quality inns way cleaner than the MGM.  Ewww.....  totally unacceptable.
3,"\""OK, even with the good and bad reviews, let's try it.\""  It was exceptional. So far it was the best shredded beef chimichanga I have had in Casa Grande. Beautifully prepared filled to capacity with beef.  On the plate a pile of guacamole, sour cream and lettuce.  Mrs had 3 tostadas,  also presented very well.  She brought home 2 of them.  Extremely quick service with a well trained happy waitress.  Small bowl of chips was replenished when empty. Salsa was really sauce in a catsup squeeze bottle- a little odd, but OK. All in all a very pleasant experience at a very reasonable price.  We'll return"
4,"We enjoy coming here for all of our ASU, Yankees, and Raiders needs. Owners are great people and Raiders fans!"
4,Can't really go bad here. They know what I want when I walk in the door. Thanks girls !
3,"Just like any other In-N-Out you have been too... However, one thing that impressed me about this place was the fact that despite the number of people that come here, they are very efficient and get the food out in a very timely manner. Other places have trouble doing that when they have only a few customers. Maybe In-N-Out in Nevada is better than Cali?"
4,Obsessed with Postinos! I live right down the street from there and frequent it quite often. I'm a vegetarian so it's sometimes difficult for me to eat places but at Postino's they have wonderful meat-free bruschetta options. They also have excellent Sangria for those who are looking for a lighter fruity alternative to wine. I like to go there on Sunday's and drink $5 Sangria pints and listen to the reggae band. So fun!
0,"Avoid this place! Happy hour is a joke, our bill came to a 100.00 for 6 drinks and 2 meals! We asked for a double on vodka and soda and it came in the same small glass as a single and tasted exactly like the single serving. After a 5 of them, we asked the waitress what is the cost for vodka and soda doubles. She said well happy hour is 5.25 and 7.25 for double. Them came back and said, I was wrong they are a $11.50!! What?!? Double charge for an extra half a shot!?! We were ordering something simple and it was supposed to be happy hour and by No means did we think they would double the charge for the same size drink with no more of a punch that the singles! No bars in Phoenix charge this but this place! The manager was confronted because 1. Her wait staff should inform people of the outrageous pricing when they order and ours was shocked of the price! 2. She needs to do some research with other bars and realize this is a rip off! The manager justified their charges, but credited a couple of shots we did. Very small gesture but a gesture! Food is ok, waitress neglected us most of night, atmosphere only thing nice about this place. Our table spent well over $300.00 for just 4 hours of being there, so what does that tell you? Ridiculous! We left without even a slight buzz (which is strange because they were supposedly 2 shots per drink) and we did 2 shot of tequila...fishy if you ask me! We will NEVER be back and I hope this helps you to ask about their prices before you order because the staff will not tell you! We will stay with the reasonable and respectable places we have been going to for years!!! This place is a huge disappointment!"
1,"on the 20th, someone mentioned on facebook that there were bad reviews on yelp. since then, there have been nothing but glowing 4 and 5 star reviews. think the owners got their friends to pump them up. I do. c'mon yelp. I was there. not impressed. menu is way too ambitious for a sports bar. some people may like that. I don't. overpriced and off the wall menu. maybe that's why they won't post it on their website. owners need to make up their minds. do they want to be a neighborhood sports bar like they claim, or do they want to be an upscale, overpriced, overrated bistro gastro pub in a neighborhood location. if I want to get ripped off I can go to the strip. i'm looking for a true neighborhood pub. hope they go in that direction."
4,"I love a good cocktail.  I mean, who doesn't?  This place provides just that.  The menu offers some excellent choices and, if you're open-minded, you can put yourself at \""The Mercy of the Bartender.\""  It a cocktail made of whatever they are feeling that day.  Now it was my first visit, so I just did a bourbon cocktail and MAN.  It was spectacular.  The ingredients blended beautifully and the bartender was really cool to boot.  Drinks average $9-$12, but they are worth every penny.\n\nThe ambiance is kind of sexy: just dim enough with lots of beautiful wood tones.  There is a tv, which I noticed they had on for the Pirates playoff run.  But as soon as the game was over, that tv went off I'm glad to report!  Now there were 2 tables I noticed that had damned near spotlights directly overhead.  Sit there if you're on a date with someone you're just not so sure you'd like to see again (or with friends, since no once cares about being sexy).  \n\nThis place is connected to Legume, so while I didn't eat here I am sure the food is amazing.  I have already raved about it to several friends and will continue to do so. Can't wait to go back!"
3,"Looking for place to watch the game with a lot of tv's, has cold beer and really good wings? Here ya go, Hurricane Grill is it. This place is nothing special with decor or anything, but the selection of wing sauce is outstanding, and the size of the bone-in wings is excellent. The waitress gave us a recommendation on 2 sauces that was spot on. We will be back again and again. Comfortable neighborhood spot."
3,Great specials.  The food is light and is not greasy at all.  Taste very fresh.  Would visit again
3,"Second visit to Fresh Wasabi back in early September... \n\nArizona Rolls, fabulous... As I previously stated, we are not sushi fans, I must amend, we were not sushi fans, we are beginning to be now... And the Arizona Roll is what brought us around!  Very fresh, firm but not sticky rice that was also very light.  The Wasabi was full of flavor but not too hot.  We do wish they had given us a little more though...\n\nCalamari... It was ok, it was chewy, rubbery, over cooked.  The batter was really good and the sauce was tasty and this was the saving grace. Once the calamari cooled though, it was just gross...\n\nUdon noodles, again, very hot, Momma said too hot and based on my prior experience with them, I have to agree.  The broth was fabulous, again, and the yummies in the dish were just that, yummy!  I still think it needed more meat, but it is a noodle dish...\n\nSpicy chicken dinner combo... Wish the chicken pieces were bigger but the spices and sauce were phenomenal!!!!!!  Portion was really good and plentiful without being too much...\n\nAs with last time, for some reason I have a hard time pin-pointing, the service was lacking.  We got drink refills and it was reasonably attentive, but something was missing... At least this time there was no dissertation on bento boxes and sushi... Wish I could figure out what it was... Just off somehow... \n\nOverall, they earned a star over last visit and we will be back, no doubt!"
1,"I did have high expectations because of Tom Collichio's name and the fact that I LOVE Craftsteak, but this place was disappointing. The sandwich I had was okay but nothing special. I've had better sandwiches in Portland."
3,"I really enjoyed my stay here!\n\nWe used a groupon and I will stay there again when I visit Arizona.  The rooms were very tidy, bath and body works collection available for shampoo and soap.  \n\nI loved how the pool was open all night as well.  The pool and hot tub did need a bit of scooping because there was some debri in there but nothing terrible.  Towels were available as well as water too for the guests.\n\nThe front desk people were very pleasant and gave us an early check in no problem.  \n\nMy fiance and I wanted to go down to Mill avenue and were pleasantly surprised when the front desk said there was a 24 hour complimentary shuttle that would take us and pick us up.  The driver was very helpful with advice on places to go and also tips to keep out of trouble. :)\n\nWe went to Milagros for a margarita too, and the bartender was very pleasant and the drinks were not crazy expensive.\n\nThe hotel is very close to Arizona Mills mall and other places in Tempe.  It was worth every penny!"
1,"The name Cardinal Pizza is sort of a misnomer for this (mainly) Latin American restaurant that specializes in Salvadoran and Nicaraguan food.  Yes, pizza is on the menu; however, when I went for lunch, I didn't see any pizzas being ordered.\n\nI spent part of my summer in Nicaragua last year, and I had some AMAZING papusas down there.  Since then, I've had a serious papusa craving, and when I saw the sign in the window, I figured I'd give them a shot.  While they got the basic idea, Cardinal Pizza's papusas aren't even close to the ones I had in Managua.  They're a bit bland, and the salsa and cabbage-like toppings weren't great, either.  Unfortunate, but live and learn..."
1,"Okay, I'll be the first to admit that I am not of the tax bracket that enjoys meals frequently at Michelin rated fine dining establishments BUT when a special occasion calls for it I'm usually pleased as punch to drop the extra change on an uber-fab dining experience. We went to Bartolotta for a girlfriend's birthday two weeks ago and let me tell you the decor is GORGEOUS, much of the dining area looks more like private outdoor cabanas (which is where we enjoyed our meal), the service was good, not great, our waiter was friendly but did spill some of my wine on my arm while pouring and had the busboy come back to check on us after the food was delivered to think of it he didn't even handle our payment. \nBut let's talk about what's really important here - the food. Okay, so the prices on the menu are MORE than intimidating - they charge by the ounce for the fish! And they're whole fish - no room for \""I'd like a 3 ounce serving please\"" but it was my friends birthday so we ordered the sole that was served over sauteed spinach - it was only decent - when you figure in the price for the only decent sole ($110) it was really POOR. There were six of us total and we all agreed that the best part of the meal by far was the fantastic Italian desserts - not great news considering this is a SEAFOOD restaurant. One final note, do not order the langastine - they are $15 EACH and smelled like they'd been sitting out too long."
0,"I don't know why I spent even a couple hours in this revamped casino hotel because I wasn't impressed from the start.\n\nThe dealers at the blackjack tables are dolled up ladies who circulate between dealing cards and go go dancing.  All fine and dandy if they weren't so rude!\n\nI also expected a lower table limit considering we were downtown and not on the strip.  Yes, it was a Saturday night but $10 minimums at all tables?!?  You can actually find casinos that are similar to this little hole for $3 minimums on the strip (you have to look hard, but they're there!).\n\nMaybe the rooms were nice but I didn't stay there."
3,"This is where we take our two cats.  They are excellent.  Dr. Lisa is our attending Vet and all of the staff just love to see you and your animal children.\n\nFull service, surgery, recovery ward and whatever is needed to care for your pets.\n\nThey will be moving soon to a new location further down the road across from Lowe's.  Their current location can be easily missed as it is back from Hwy 521 and you can wiz by their driveway in an instant.\n\nWe do like this operation."
3,"I've been here four times and I'm digging it!  It's so far up north that it's a nice break from the 'watch-your-rear\"" Westgate thug-a-dub-dub-gangstafied crew.  If I were a gangbanger here I'd be throwing it up for the NORTHSIDE (carefree highway, baby).\n\nNever had a real meal here but I've had plenty finger food and a few troughs of alcohol!  Finally a bar that has darts, pool tables, and yes, occassionally beer pong.  \n\nI do have to disagree with Chris T's POV on the women in the Scottish skirts....c'mon dude it's women in skirts, bro!  Heck, I'd take a semi-hot girl serving me beerski's over a dude any day!\n\nThe outdoor seating is fun, nice televisions outside and usually a good crowd.  \n\nIt's a good mix of people.  It's a biker-friendly bar but you will find all types here and everyone seems to get along.  The only thing I don't care for is the setup of the mens bathroom.  It's set up so that when the door opens, anyone looking can see the mirror, which looks right at whoever's throwing a whiz.  \n\nIf you're up this far north, it's definatley worth getting your drink on."
2,"Old school. This was the first LVAC I went to when I first signed up years and years ago. It was far from my house back then. It's far from my house now. Fortunately, LVAC has expanded with newer, nicer, and closer facilities.\n\nThis place is still adequate. There are plenty of cardio machines and plenty of weight machines. The ATC (Advanced Training Center) is of a good size. The pool is just as good as any other LVAC. There are two group training rooms and the main one is of a decent size.\n\nI noticed that none of the cardio machines have personal TV screens. Being an older location, it's only one story and doesn't have the running track. I think the parking lot is pretty small for peak workout times.\n\nOverall, if you live near this LVAC, it should work fine for your needs. As for me, I only use it if I'm in the area."
0,"Attended a wedding at Seville Golf and Country Club.  The Doubletree provided a shuttle to the event and also scheduled a pickup immediately following the event.  On our way the driver didn't provide professional customer service ( didn't help us out of the van).  At the conclusion the ride was over 2 hours late.  We had to call multiple times, very disappointed in the service."
4,"I've got to give this place a 5 star! We drove from Maricopa to go furniture shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus. We had an excellent experience and will absolutely be going back!"
2,"It was very inexpensive to stay here for 4 nights, which was why we chose it. The room was clean, but the ventilation blew cigarette smoke into our non-smoking room, which was pretty gross.  You also get to go up to the top of the tower for free if you're staying there, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  Wasn't horrible, but probably would never stay here again because of the smoke."
1,"So I drive by this place a few times a week, and after seeing their cheesy commercials I've decided to give this place a try. I would not recommend their pizza at all. I had the California Pizza which includes your typical pizza veggies, and I have to say...NO FLAVOR at ALL!!! Even with added salt and pepper..no flavor!!! This was the first time coming here after being in AZ for 2 years...and will be my LAST!!!"
1,"I've heard good things about Tuesday Mornings so I decided to give it a try. \n\nIt felt like a smaller cramped version of Last Chance with more housewares than clothing. And I am not a fan of Last Chance.\n\nI was really hoping to like this store....but nothing thrilled me at all. A lot of stuff seemed damaged and the prices weren't all that great. Don't know if I'm just cheap or don't shop at high-end stores that much but when I look at a price tag and actually utter the phrase, \""THAT'S a clearance price?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"", it isn't good.\n\nProbably won't be heading back. \n\n(Is the problem that I went on a Friday afternoon instead of a Tuesday morning?) (Just asking.....)"
3,"I had heard of ADC but had never heard him ;) so I listened to a short youtube clip and new this was not a comedian to take my mom to, so I invited a friend. The first opening act was funny and I enjoyed him. The second female opening act was pretty crude. Then ADC came out wearing shades chain smoking and tore up the 21st century modern women and their sexuality. I don't blame him one bit for leaving those shades on and using the smoke as a shield of protection while he truthfully spat out his horrors of ho's. Comedians are like court jesters informing the king that he's naked.. what a great job to get paid for! Beware paying $9 for a can of corona and $11 for a glass of house wine :/"
2,"Couple things on most recent visit-\nCalamari was surprisingly good\nWaitstaff still act in a haphazard manner, had 3 different waiters during night. Some of the younger ones went into back room and I speculate were drinking. I mean whatever but its a sign this place is possibly headed downhill\nMy steak ordered medium came out darn near rare and then after a heat up came back leather\nFinally, the bull that was out on Sahara is now in the backroom as some truck hit the pole it was on and knocked it off! A bit odd this long time iconic sign is gone and doesn't seem they will be putting it back up. Yet another sign this spot is not being run at a high end professional level."
2,"Mickies, a Madison institution. Had to try it, glad I did, even happier that I won't have to again. Now, I will say that I am not a big fan of piles of breakfast foods covered in gravy, but their's was certainly nothing special. I got the Scrambler because that is what you get when you go to Mickies. It was good not great. The coffee was decent, the atmosphere was existent, all was satisfactory. \n\nI am told that this place is packed most days and that on game days (like the day I attended) it has an hour plus wait. If I had waited even 10 minutes to sit down this place would have only gotten 2 stars. Just saying.  All in all it was a pleasant experience."
3,"I've just returned to AZ after a long period of time in Seattle where there are no Chick-fil-a's. While I don't exactly agree with some of their corporate philosophies, including the whole silly closed on Sundays things, I still find myself craving that #4 spicy chicken combo.. \n\nDid you know you can order your sandwich bun-less and have them wrap it up in lettuce for you? It's certainly messier, but just as delicious.\n\nAnd I LOVE chick-fil-a sauce.. I swear they put crack in that stuff.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I can also recommend the honey mustard sauce even though its a tad too sweet for my taste."
0,"The service is AWFUL! the sloppy waiter made us wait for over an hour even though we had a reservation, and not only that, but he got other people who did NOT have a reservation seated before us!! he was walking back and forth to collect dishes and ignore us and not even apologize... \nafter we eventually got seated, nobody came to take our order for another half an hour... the food was not the best either.. everything arrived only luke-warm.. \nthe worst dining experience ever, all the waiter and waitresses are ignorant and slow slow slooow.. not going back...\nAVOID THIS PLACE!"
0,"***UPDATE***\nAfter posting the following review, I was contacted via Yelp by a person calling herself \""Kate G.\"". Kate stated, \""I would like to get your phone number so that our corporate side can look into this and discuss.\"" I asked Kate G. who she was & she stated she was Landry's Social Media Coordinator. Why didn't you tell me that in your first e-mail? Ummm, I don't hand out my phone number to random internet contacts!\nWhy on earth would I give my phone number to Kate? Does she think I want to be bothered my her or Corporate? I can't be bought off with a gift certificate from Landry's. I will never eat there again. I filed a complaint with the Southern Nevada Health District!!! So, listen up Kate G., you can NOT have any of my personal information. May I suggest you introduce yourself before asking for someone's phone number. BTW, I still have nightmares over what happened to me! \n\nI got so ill after eating here I thought I would die. Never again! I had a steak, loaded potato, green beans & one glass of wine. I'll have PTSD whenever I think of that night."
3,"Great location and great sandwiches.  \n\nHad lunch here one afternoon and really enjoyed the chicken florentine sub sandwich.  If the rest of the sandwiches are as good as this one and so reasonably priced then this place is a winner.\n\nThe location is between the stadiums and on the river, almost directly across form the amphitheater.  I was jogging in the evening along the river and the place was packed.  There was plenty of activity around since there was a home game for the Pirates and a concert going on at the amphitheater.  I was tempted to get cleaned up and go back but left it at being very satisfied with my lunch."
3,"These guys are a great little hideout of fresh ingredients in a Mario Batali warehouse.  It's like Foodie Fight Club, only you should totally tell everyone about it!    For great condition organic veggies and fruit -- at a good price -- this is the place to go.  There's also a bread vendor who sells amazingly delicious Rye for $4 a loaf -- if you miss out on this, you'll be bereft of some good sandwiches!  \n\nIf you're looking for where all the top chefs get quality niche ingredients, this is the spot.  Make sure you get there Thursdays!"
0,"I have only had take-out while at work from here. I would never go there to eat. What is the deal with the giant bread? I can never order anything hot because it won't be when I get it. I kow a lot of people like it and maybe it is what they order and what I order, but I just have NEVER liked anything I have gotten from this place!"
0,"I am stunned. I have read reviews and people say it is just like PF Changs. Whoa I don't think so. I was in the process of ordering online but since this was the first time I wanted to make sure they made it the crispy shrimp they advertise instead of just shrimp as it is on their online menu. I phoned the order in and told them crispy shrimp, with emphasis...instead when I got home I received soggy \""honey glazed\"" chicken, which almost indefinitely was simply sweet and sour sauce. I was hoping to order a Mongolian style beef but since their Mongolian sauce is not spicy as indicated, I tried the black pepper instead and unfortunately they only have \""steak\"" not beef. And it was the lowest quality of steak I have ever had, no exaggeration, it was literally beef jerky chunks, and to top it off (literally) it was layed over soggy fried rice (due to the black pepper sauce).  I am shocked people like their meals on top of each other like that.  Even Panda Express separates their dishes.  The lo mein noodles really didn't differ from Panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it, and for $9 with bland \""crispy\"" yet dry chicken I will say that it was another disappointment.  The Thai peanut sauce tasted like something my young child would make, unedible.  I hope you don't waste your money here, BJ's restaurant is right there, as well as Islands, NY Pizza which has some of the best pizzas in town."
1,"I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves. \n\nThat said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul."
4,"I can't believe no one has reviewed Piero's. This is a Las Vegas Gem. I've been dining at Piero's since 2000. This is an off strip restaurant, you don't have to walk a mile in a casino to get here. \nPiero's has been featured in some major movies Casino for one, and it is a celebrity hide away. It is very unpretentious, you'll see Vegas locals and high rollers and everyone in between. I saw Justin Timberlake here once and Penne from Penne and teller.\n\n\nOK...now to the food and service. The service is topnotch. Your never without a drink, they even offer bottled water for free not the usual filtered tap. When the bread basket comes it just out of the oven a delish!!!! The menu offers classic Italian and seafood. The Piero's classic is a bone in Veal Parm, I think its like 30 ounces.  \n\nThis is def a must for people who visit Vegas often and want to get off the strip. It is very old school Vegas, and reservations are a must. \n\nAnd if you go tell then Lisa from Boston sent you!!!!! Just kidding!!!"
4,"Del Frisco's is as good as it gets in my opinion.  \n\nWith some serious dieting ahead of both Terri R and I, a weekend of cheat meals filled our calendar.  I have to be honest, I originally wanted Ruth Chris but they were booked this evening.  So, I ended up making reservations here solely based on other Yelper's reviews.  Great choice Mel! Pat myself on my back time. \n\nFirst of all, service was top notch.  It all started with the lovely and very nice, Priscilla.  From start to finish, she was delightful, helpful, and made our dining experience that much better.  Along with great service from Priscilla, we received the same type service from everyone serving the food.  This place is stacked with employees that go out of their way to make you feel like you and your date are the only ones in the restaurant.  Your unsightly empty dishes are swept away with the quickness and they even clean up around you with their handy dandy table swifters.  All this pampering during dinner and you wouldn't even notice it until they're gone\n\nNow for the food.  We got their Prime Pair, which is their $49 per person Prix Fixe. This is a special only running through Labor Day so hurry up peeps.  This is a great deal. \n\nPrime Par (Prix Fixe)\n1.  Salads:  You get your choice of salads from their Del's, Wedge, or Caesar.  We both got their Caesar. Although it was good, it was a just a beast to eat since it wasn't chopped.  Terri worked her way through the salad and I didn't because I thought it was too much work. Not docking Del's because you don't go to a steakhouse and review their salad. \n\n2.  Dinner Bread:  Nothing special here.  You get a loaf of their sesame bread.  For a place that serves quality food, the bread was less than average.  But again, you don't come to a steak house for bread.  \n\n3.  The entree is an 8 oz hand cut Filet Mignon with your choice of crab cakes, shrimp, or scallops.  I had the crab cakes, which is drenched in lobster sauce.  My goodness....this was delicious.  Terri had the shrimp and she said it was delicious as well.  She offered, but I was focused on my meal.  Now for the filet mignon....this was the 1st highlight.  Great tasting filet, high protein, and tasted like any other top notch steakhouse out here.  I mean it.  This steak can give Ruth Chris a run for their money and it's probably a tad healthier since it's not drenched in butter.  Their steaks didn't have that melt in your mouth feel, but it did have that taste of a well prepped filet. \n\n4.  Sides:  You also have a choice of sides that included potatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and corn. We got the potatoes, mushrooms, and for an additional cost, added their Lobster Mac N Cheese.  The 2nd highlight to this evening had to be their Lobster Mac.  Creamy/cheesy mac, lobster chunks, and a hint of lobster sauce describes this. Tough to explain, but it's probably the best lobster mac that I have ever had.  \n\nOverall, I am giving Del Frisco's 5 stars because I expected just an okay, above average dining experience and obviously got more.  I was so consumed with my beautiful date and superb dining experience, I even forgot to snap a few photos.  But at a place like this, photos would just ruin the experience anyway. \n\nLooking for filet mignon, a great dining experience, and somewhere off the strip...look to Del Frisco's.  You won't be disappointed."
4,Mmmm... First time here. Foods amazing!!! cant wait to go back!!
1,"I have such a soft spot for Chinese Buffets.  I love that I can get lots of weird little things for one small price.  Really though, if I am being perfectly honest, I'm just going to gorge myself on Chinese Donuts (fried pieces of dough rolled in sugar).\n\nThis place is not the cleanest of establishments, and it has a really weird open feeling going on.  It really needs a little love.  Strip off the peeling wallpaper and put up a couple coats of fresh paint and no one will know the difference!  At least I wasn't afraid to eat here.\n\nThe food was not bad, but it just wasn't interesting.  A lot of the chicken dishes were overcooked and some of the stuff was so heavily battered that not all of it got cooked through so you had a bit of a mushy mess.  The standout was definitely the fried rice.  It was really really good fried rice.  I also liked the beef and broccoli, but that's about it.\n\nThere's not really much else to say, but for about 6 bucks, I'm not really going to complain."
3,"This is the old Rigatony's on Brown Rd- If you've never been, it has a Buca di Bepo-ish, before Buca was cool, sort of feel. They even serve their house chianti in a small water glass, instead of a wine goblet- adding to an authentic \""Joisey\"" kind of feel.\n\nThis is traditional Italian-American fare, rich and flavorful- with big portions. The Chicken Piccata is crack-good. It's served in what I've come to learn is a Sicilian style, with a n awesome relish of tomatoes, capers, and green olives and a side of addictive Fett Alfredo. It never gets old.\n\nAnother great authentic dish is their Cecca- you can get it as a \""Pie\"" (Pizza, that is) or over pasta. You just have try it. It's rich, refreshing, and explosively flavorful all at once.\n\nThe house salad is a variation on a traditional AntiPasto theme- and is a meal, and event, in and of its self.\n\nThe best thing about Mardeneley's is that EVERYTHING on the menu is good! It only gets Four stars because it could use a bit more snob appeal (and a better beer selection)."
2,I love whole foods but this location has the basics.  The products and help is the normal 4/5 stars but this is one of the smaller locations I have seen. Their deli still has all the goodies you would expect from whole foods. Still it is better than not having a whole foods at all like most of Wisconsin.
1,"I got the Veggie Omelet and had to send it back the first time. It was alll watery, it was gross. They microwaved it or reheat it and it came back more like scrambled eggs. It came with breakfast potatoes, but no...they weren't. It was hash browns. It wasn't bad, it was just okay. The french toast was okay; it was dry, but cheap."
1,"Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.\nNot bad, but for their high prices and the quality, there are better choices in LV.\n\nNoise level is high."
2,Great service by an attentive staff. Selection seemed a bit thin since last time I was here although a great alternative to the high priced casino options.
0,"Holy Crap this place is heinous.  Its really hard to find from the miracle miles shops, its hidden at the end of a long hallway.  I didn't order food so I can't comment on that but I can say that based on the cleanliness of the bar in general I wouldn't want to.  Literally and I mean literally every surface of this establishment is sticky and I was there at 12 pm so its not like people had been there all day making a mess of the place.  Half the lights in the womens bathroom were either not on or burned out, there was dried blood droplets on the floor, and there was a small bag with sketchy looking pills in my stall.  WTF is anyone in charge of cleaning this place??  I had a bloody mary that tasted like V8 and a shot of vodka- no olive, no spice, no garlic, no celery I could have made a better drink at home.  They have Sierra Nevada for 12$ a pitcher which in my opinion is the best deal but if you can AVOID DB'S PONG AND POOL"
3,"So stumbled upon this new store on Craigslist when I was searching for fish to buy so here's the pros and cons \n\nPros: \nService: Great staff and service,the staff greeted me the first step I took into the store and love to chat and help you out with any question.\n \nFish: This store only carry saltwater fish and even  tho when I was there their fish selection was a lil meager but what they had in the tanks was healthy and the price was far since it was a fairly new store it was very clean \n\nCorals: they have a huge selection of corals and the price are not bad either \n\nCons:\n\nService: none \n\nFish: I guess they have been busy cos for the past two times I been in they where low on small to mid size fish and they where two weeks apart\n\nCorals: will I bought a Maximus clam and it had three aiptasia on it so make sure you check what your getting thoroughly!"
0,If I could rate this place any lower I would. The food is way over priced for the small portions of garbage they give you. The food is cold and tastes like it's been sitting out for days. When biting into a dumpling my bf realized there was an extremely long hair cooked into it when he called them they told him he was ungrateful. Poor customer service and terrible food. I have no idea how this place hasn't been shut down yet with the hair and metal being found in the food. I wouldn't even give a dog this muff food. I'm still hungry because I threw it away.
2,"A shiny and sleek interior, an innovative and locally sourced menu, all brought to you by a celebrity chef is everything Tee Pee Mexican Restaurant is not. Instead you get a divey old building, vinyl booths, a ceiling adorned with Christmas tree lights and an old school Tex-Mex menu that's simple, satisfying and inexpensive.\n\nEach table is automatically adorned with a pitcher of ice water and a squirt bottle filled with Tee Pee's own hot sauce. Within moments of being sat into one of the comfy old vinyl booths a large bowl of chips is brought out and accompanied chunky salsa. The chips are humongous, essentially a medium corn tortilla cut in half and deep fried to till crisp. I just wish that on my last visit the humidity from the rain hadn't made the chips more chewy than crunchy. The chunky salsa was bursting with freshness and a slight throat burn more indicative to pepper than chile. Either way, I love built in appetizers.\n\nI'm a cheese crisp fanatic, almost as much as I frenzy over good chicken wings. So I consider myself an expert by way of sheer cheese crisp volume consumed over the course of my lifetime. Having chowed on so many, there have been many great and not great, the later being a greasy flaccid disappointment. So what's great about the Green Chili Strips Cheese Crisp ($6.75) from Tee Pee? The truth in advertising. Pick up a slice and you'll find its truly crisp and rigid being followed by thick ropes of gooey melted cheddar cheese.  \n\nGreen, smooth and easy to spread, the Guacamole Dip ($5.50) while good was lacking any discernible heat. After all we're at a Mexican food restaurant and shouldn't we deserve a little bit of heat? Next time Ill ask if they can make it spicy. \n\nThe Beef Fajita Chimichanga ($11.25) is an ode to everything that is right about fried food. Huge flour tortilla filled with tender well seasoned grilled beef, onions and bell peppers, then rolled and deep fried to delicate crunch. The French fried burrito is covered with the usual suspects including red sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream and a healthy dollop of guacamole. I didn't feel an ounce of guilt eating the entire thing.\n\nWhat's good Mexican food without a mainstay like Sour Cream Enchiladas ($8.00)? Corn tortillas encircle molten cheddar cheese and sour cream then draped with Tee Pee's savory red sauce. As soon as the plate arrived I could tell that these were going to be good. Oh, by the way, when they say these plates are hot, they aren't kidding. Seriously, do no touch these or you will get burnt, I speak from experience on this one, heed their warning. However, the fieriness from the plate further enhanced the slightly smoky red chile sauce, making it that much more tangy and delicious. Both entrees were served with moist fluffy rice and thick cheesy refried beans. \n\nShow up in shorts and t-shirt, I don't think you can ever be undressed at Tee Pee but that's all part of the charm. Come as your are, even if you get enchilada sauce all over your shirt, no worries, pre-treating will take it right out."
1,Not a fan-the prime rib burger was good but most of the burgers are just awful. This location is unique as it has a Green Burrito in it too so you can get a taco salad some burittos or whatever floats your boat. I like the taco salad but havent eaten here in years.
4,"My only complaint- the long lines.  Otherwise, this place is perfect. A great stop on your tour de Montreal for bread to take on a bike ride along the lachine canal or a stop for breakfast with coffee and a decadent almond croissant. Really I can't think of anything better than the croissant- butter, chocolate or almond.  Although if you can't do 'decadent' go for the baguette with butter or jam.  Also a score, and cheap!  The loaves of bread are also fabulous. Rotating stock of olive loaf, chocolate breads, or other flavours."
2,"I feel a bit let down by my curry I ate last night... and curry is such a warm dish. You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment. \n\nSo why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman. \n\nRoom for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay. \n\nThey used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. \n\nThe better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears). \n\nOverall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location. You also can eat without a reservation at 5 if you can be done eating by 630. The prices are decent for portion size... Service is prompt polite and they will offer more rice if you need it. I think I'll try some other dishes and hope for a better outcome next time."
3,"I love this cute, quaint restaurant. You can even catch belly dancing here on the early weekend nights! The food is amazing. Be sure to try the thick hummus and the Shawarma. \n\nEven the drinks are unique. I had one of the best glasses of lemonade (it was extremely fresh tasting and it had a pleasant aroma) and was unlike anything other lemonade I've ever sipped.\n\nThere's also a market inside the restaurant where you can pick up a pound of Feta."
4,Dave is simply wonderful. He will make sure that you are well informed and he will keep the costs of repairs affordable. you will be in good hands.
3,"I LOVE TACOS! Safe to say i could probably have tacos just about every day and be a very happy woman! It was hot as hell for being mid October but still was able to enjoy myself. Two bucks a taco and we all had a decent amount. Good karma happened to follow us that day, a guy was leaving and handed us about 20 xtra tickets that he was not going to use. SCORE! So we were able to grub and drink even more than we intended. Overall I think that event was a success. I didn't have any trouble getting drinks as other people mentioned, maybe it was the time of day I showed up and it was less busy."
2,"I thought I should write a review for this place because I got an extra chicken finger in my meal... (vegas luck?) and I also won money gambling that day...and it started off with that extra chicken finger!\n\nI ordered #2 which comes with 3 chicken fingers (but i got 4 and I saw it as a sign that I had good luck to gamble haha), fries, and their very buttery toast bread!\n\nFast food is usually not my thing with all that extra grease and oil, but Canes was pretty good with their special canes sauce that I dipped everything in. I think the chicken is just ok and their unsweetened icetea is pretty good. I mixed the unsweetened with 1/8 sweetened ice tea (otherwise it's just too sweet).  My favorite was definitely the bread though (I would exchange that over fries) :)"
3,"Met a colleague for lunch here the other day.  Decided to order the Club Sandwich w/Fries, $11.  He warned me that they don't mess around with their portion size....he was right.  This Sandwich was huge!  In addition to that, it comes with a large pile of skinny Fries.  The Club Sandwich was very good.....and the Fries were outstanding.  I could eat a large plate of those Fries.\n\nThe service was great as well.  Overall, a pleasant \""working\"" lunch experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
0,"Dropped off laundry and dry cleaning:  25-30 pieces.  Had a great front desk service when I was there during the week; picked up my clothes on a Saturday and was met by the most unfriendly woman I have met in the service industry in some time.\nNo \""hello\""  No \""thanks for spending 125.00\""...just a mean glare when I asked that she help me count the pieces to be certain it was all there...I asked if she was the owner and she said \""nope\"" to which I replied \""good thing since you are very unfriendly\""....she could have cared less...my money will go elsewhere which is terrible since I live so close...their loss."
4,Friendly service and delicious ice cream!
4,"Was in town for the Steelers game of course!  Drove around the area the night before and the stadium just happened to be open....not to walk around the whole thing, but at least to walk in and go into the store, which was exciting!!!  \nDay of game was awesome...pleasant staff!  Stadium is HUGE and beautiful!!!  Loved seeing the walk of fame and all the other awards along the stadium in cases.  Good location, easy to find, plenty of parking!  Sat in section 529 which yes, was up high, but still a perfect view of the field!  Can't wait to return!!!!"
1,"Pretty standard sports bar.  Plenty of TVs, even outside, though a number of them must have had bad connections because they were constantly garbled.  \nFood was ok. Had the pepper crusted tuna.  Tuna was tasty and the broccoli al dente  but the white rice it was served with was over cooked and mushy. My GFs burger and fries were just fine. \nService was slow, empty beer glasses waiting to be filled. \nDon't sit out on the patio if you're sensitive to cigarette or cigar smoke.  That is generally where the smokers come out when drinking."
4,"I grew up going to Cheddars in Lexington, KY!  Their Club Sandwich, Monte Cristo, and Chicken Tenders will make even the unhappiest person happy again. The servers were all very nice at this location and I love that we have this staple in the Valley! I can't wait to go back with my family!"
0,"On August 30, 2013, I was staying at the LVH right around the corner from this store. Due to the heat, my battery in the truck died, but I was able to get it jumped. The Bellman at the hotel recommended going to this Pep Boys. I drove there and parked in the \""drive-up\"" service area, yet after 15 minutes, no one came to help. So I walked inside and went to the service area. There was a young blond girl and a young man there. Neither of them even bothered to look up and greet me, or even ask what they could do for me. Instead, they kept their faces at their computers and probably hoped I would go away. After another 15 minutes of standing there, some other guy told me I was in the wrong place and sent me to another counter. After another 15 minutes, and still no one helped me, I got frustrated and left. I drove Autozone across the street and got all kinds of help. Got the new battery, they loaned me tools to get it out, and refunded me for my old battery. It just amazes me that a Pep Boys store so close to the casinos wouldn't be a little more helpful, and maybe friendly. Not even a \""Welcome\"", or \""hello\"" was given to me. I would have been happy with a \""We aint got time for you pal, so bug off.\"" Well, that is kind of what I got. They couldn't care a less that I left............ Its just sad because they could make so much money at that location with out of town folks. They really need to work on their customer service. Go somewhere else folks."
2,"Old faithful, no surprises as far as the product goes.  The one thing that surprised me is that they are not set up to take gift cards or the android app.   I charged up my card before i left because I don't like to carry too much cash around.  Oh well."
4,"Great food, awesome price, great service...it's funny cut its hidden so well in the area it's in, I've passed this place and never knew about these awesome burgers"
4,"This place is quite amazing. Lets start when I first walked into the cafe, quaint and clean. That's how I like my restaurant. Guy behind the counter said pick where ever you want to sit. Thumbs up, even better. Sit towards the back of the restaurant. Waiter comes out to give us the menu, small chitchat, he takes our drink orders. We look over the menu, classic German fair (schnitzel, sausage, etc) I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel and a side of Red Cabbage. While waiting for my food, (enjoying a Warsteiner Pilnser on tap!!) I took notice to all the decor. The German flags, the US flag and all the Berlin posters was a real nice touch of ambiance. The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods, my schnitzel was cooked perfect. The gravy that come on it was also perfect. Flavorful and delicious! The red cabbage was also cooked to perfection. Takes me back to when I was a child, eating German food with my family. After I was done with my entree, I had to order the strudel (apple) and wow, it was amazing. Talk about putting the cherry on the sundae. It was a perfect ending to an amazing meal. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. I fully and whole heartily hope this place does well. I will be visiting this place as frequently as I can. I hope everyone gets to have the same experience as I do."
4,"I love, love, love Thai Basil! It is fast, reasonably priced and, best of all, DELICIOUS! One thing that is really great is they have a lunch special for $6.95 that includes a cup of a vegetable broth soup, entr\u00e9e and egg roll (the menu said \""fruit\"" also, but it's really just a slice of orange to drizzle on your entr\u00e9e, which is a nice touch). I think their Thai iced tea is fabulous also. It's a classy place and yet feels very comfortable, and you know it must be good because a lot of people of Asian descent eat here on a regular basis. My favorite dishes are the noodle ones, like pad thai and pad-see-ew, hubby likes the rice dishes, but we both go for the tofu. It's nice to be able to eat totally vegetarian and have a delicious filling meal. If you're like us, you'll go back again and again!"
4,I can eat here couple times a week... no joke!\nCheap... tasty... no wait... and the best katsu curry in the city hands down!\nI wanted to have my fix one last time before leaving the city the other day but the electricity was down! oh well.\nIf you love katsu curry... this is a must!!!\nMy favorite gem in LV chinatown!
1,"This is not an exciting candy store and the stock looks old. The self serve candy bins offer a decent variety and you'll find plenty of Jelly Belly beans if that's your thing, but I've seen way cooler and more fun candy shops.\n\nI was specifically looking for some giant gummy bears and they had only 1 left, which wasn't that giant at all and it looked like it had been sitting there forever.\n\nThere's also a Bilboquet ice cream shop inside, with hard ice cream and sorbet to choose from but it looked messy and unappealing. Flavors are hard to read, scribbled on a chalk board. If you're looking for ice cream, there's a shop right across the street that will prove to be much more satisfying."
3,"After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.\n\nWith the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.\n\nThe pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. \n\nOur dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.\n\nThe cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!"
3,I'm all about the Chips & Salsa.  My usual Happy Hour fix here: Queso Fundido & Chips and an Iced Tea. Always great service. I can't wait for tomorrow's Happy Hour here. Cheers***
3,"This Starbucks always seems to be busy, probably because its at the train stations. But there are always seats and the baristas move fast here so I feel I don't wait very long for my drink, makes up for the line time. Great place to kill 30 or 40 min till ones train arrives."
1,"IKEA can suck my LEKSVIK.\n\nEvery time I go to IKEA, I'm reminded why I hate it so much - and yet I keep returning. Just entering the store is like going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride - once you enter, you can't leave until you've taken the entire tour through the maze of shitty Swedish furniture. They provide you with cheap shitty food, a place to crap or puke it out, and strategically placed seating so you can rest. They black out the windows so you have no sense of time as well. It's evil genius. \n\nI think it's absurd that people actually eat here - like they just accept that they are being held prisoner by an evil Swedish furniture factory. The cheap food is too cheap - it's gut-rot inducing and it pains me just to think about it. Hot Dogs and Meat Balls? Are you serious? You don't even know what kind of mystery meat it is - much less if it's even real meat... and you happily pay a buck like you're really sticking it to the man with your bargain meal. Gag me.\n\nJust like at Disneyland, people bring their fucking ugly kids here and allow them to run around free screaming like wild animals. Parents use their strollers as battering rams to make way through the crowd. Nobody in there has ever showered in their life. I sometimes suspect that everyone there is a paid extra - nobody is ever buying anything.\n\nThere are two ways to shop here: 1. Arrive having researched and read the catalog and have a specific list of things to buy. 2. Wander around aimlessly for 3 hours, pick up something that you kinda need and carry it around with you for another 3 hours, give up the moment you have the exit door in sight and leave your single pathetic item on a pallet of flat-pack deck chairs and bypass the checkout lines so you can taste freedom at last.\n\nIKEA furniture is cheap, but expensive. It looks nice from far away, but up close you can see that it's junk. Run your hand along any of their wood counter surfaces and you'll feel the warping. Have a look at any corner on any dresser and you'll see the finish peeling away. It's good for utility furniture or to fill out a guest bedroom or storage room or kids room, but unless you're a college kid - this furniture is garbage. To top it off, it's overpriced. \n\nThe only things worth buying here are lightbulbs and batteries (which honestly aren't that great) because they are cheap. Even their flatware is crap - it rusts... yes, it rusts. You're better off going to Tuesday Morning or Ross or even Target and picking up something nicer. Don't be fooled by the contemporary modern urban stylings - IKEA is overpriced crappy junk. It's not cheap because they flat pack and pass the savings on to you - it's cheap because it's junk. \n\nI have some IKEA dressers and I use them as DVD storage - they work fine, but I don't expect them to last forever. Their couches are all uncomfortable, their chairs are even worse. The beds are barely one step up from sleeping on the floor. Their kitchen and bathroom cabinets are awful - you'll be sorry if you remodel your rooms with this stuff. \n\nI like the look of IKEA - honestly, I do. I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced. That said - you can find some decent stuff here. Inexpensive poorly-crafted furniture has its applications."
2,"Le roll \u00e9tait certes tr\u00e8s bon, mais 21,21$ pour le trio avec Di\u00e8te Coke, tasse de chowder (correct) et chips? La prime du buzz et du lieu est ch\u00e8re pay\u00e9e. Et le pain est un pain style Weston. Une chance que les chips \u00e9taient des Miss Vickie..."
0,"absolutely awful the fish and chips was on a par with Long John Silvers, $6-25 for a bottle of Harp, $30-00 total and the skank waitress after I left $40-00 to cover it asked \""do you want change\"" well duh I ain't leaving 33.333% for something that should have cost $10 max jeez avoid at all costs !"
3,"So i'll start off by saying its not the best BBQ in the world, but its definitely one of the better ones.  Especially for a large high volume chain.  \n\nI'll start off by saying I don't like corn bread, but the way they do their's is awesome!!  They have two platters, I usually always get the large even with only two people for a TON of leftovers. It normally serves 4-6.  \n\nBrisket is tender, ribs are fall off the bone, corn is sweet and never dry.  Even the pice of bread under the brisket is something to savor.  We even found ourselves buying their sauces (they have 6 if I recall) and the pickle chips.  Oh those pickle chips..  Buy the BIG jar at costco!!  \n\nCan't say anything about the price as BBQ is always expensive, but this is at the lower end.  If you have BBQ in mind and your not from Texas or Oklahoma, then don't hesitate with this place.  If you are from Texas or OK, tell me what you find here.  \n\nPS, i've been to other Famous Dave's and they are just as good, very consistent."
2,"Well, we finally visited \""The Head Restaurant.\""  \n\nI don't know why, but I'm not excessively fond of Viva Michoacan.  I don't get it.  A lot of people rave about the bean dip.  I thought it was pretty bland and soupy.  I also didn't think the salsa had much flavor, and the chips were pretty burnt.\n\nOur food was also just okay.  Bland.  Generic.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing, but it wasn't all that flavorful.  It wasn't NASTY, but it wasn't that great either.\n\nThe service was attentive... maybe too much so.  Each server had the same mannerisms and the same exact vocal inflection.  I get the whole idea of scripting, but it was a little creepy.  I called them the Stepford Senoras.  It was that bad.\n\nThe other off-putting thing about the place is the photo service.  Basically, you're accosted at your table by a staff photographer who tries to pimp you photos of you at the Viva Michoacan, stuffing your head.  I wasn't prepared for that...I rolled out of bed late and came for an early lunch.  My fianc\u00e9 and I concluded that we looked homeless.  Definitely weren't gonna buy THOSE photos, which is awkward.  Not a fan of the whole photo idea.\n\nThe three stars were earned for sheer EFFORT.  Between the servers and the mariachi band and the photo service, this place just reeks of desperation.  They are really out there hustling for the dollars.  I give them props for that.  But it's just a bit too much.  Dial it back a notch, Head Restaurant."
2,"This was my first trip ever to Vegas. I recently went out there the weekend of 8/19/2011 for my wedding and I was going crazy trying to plan a wedding in 3 months and to top it off somewhere I've never been to so I have to say I was really worried how everything was going to turn out being that it was our (my husbands & I) first time in Vegas and all the reviews I was reading really didn't help much. \n\nAfter all the going back and fort on where to stay we finally decide on the flamingo mainly because our kids liked the pictures of the pool and our lil guy wanted to see flamingos and it's in the middle of the strip. We had a few people staying there lucky us my grandfather booked us a suite as a wedding gift we stayed in the Go Room Deluxe I believe it was a little over $300.00 for the weekend. We were on the 22nd floor everyone else on 12th & 14th floors. \n\nSoon as we got to Vegas we had problems with check-ins had to wait hours in a long line just to get our rooms my sister paid an extra 40 bucks just to get an early check-in so my grandfather would be able to get some rest. They told us our room would be ready by 1pm we didn't get in our room until 4pm that's after a few times asking if it was ready and my sister finally specking with a manager. If you ever stay at the flamingo here's my warning. Check-ins are a pain in the ass ! \n\nThe room was really nice we had a great view of the strip we could see the belligo water show which was really nice. the bathroom was cool had two sinks one with a tv in the mirror kids loved that when the came to chill (they stayed in a separate room with my mom) ;) and frosted glass shower doors with a king bed that was comfortable the room has a plasma tv on the wall and a ipod radio/alarm clock. The walls are pink but it is the flamingo and we didn't have a problem with that as I read some reviews alot of people do. The only thing I had a problem with is the ac I think because of the big ass window and the sun beaming in it felt like the ac wasn't\""t even on we had the curtain's closed thinking it would cool down the room but you had to be sitting still to feel a little cool. So other then the ac there was a few nicks here and there but there is alot of people who visit Vegas so I wouldn't\""t expect everything to be perfect. \n\nThe casino itself is nice I could do with out the smoke you walk out feeling like you smoked 100 packs and need a oxygen mask to breath this coming from a nonsmoker. The food inside and at the pool especially the pool is really good. The pool is amazing they have a kid pool with slides which my kids loved i swear they stayed in that pool allllll day. A few of us adults chilled at the 21 over pool loved it water was nice and the pool not to croweded.We chilled at the garden bar inside the flamingo its pretty cool the go-go dancers were awesome friendly and pretty had nice bodies. \n\nAll in all being it was my first hotel stay and visit to Vegas it was nice and i would stay again."
1,"Very expensive and average. Every other restaurant in our casino was jammed so we went here. Food was ok. My shrimp dish was $25+ for only five shrimp! No pasta/rice or anything else with it. Ridiculous. To top it off, warm beer. Only upside was good service."
2,"People have asked me why I like going to Wendy's for a burger.  You could go to McDonalds instead.   (And I do, often for breakfast.)  Or you could go to Burger King, for a Whopper (which I do, on Wednesdays, because it's only $1.99 for the Whopper, plus applicable taxes).  But there is a good reason to go to Wendy's.\n\nThe reason I go to Wendy's is for a Grand Slam.\n\nThere's a 1/4 pound Single.  There's a 1/2 pound Double.  There's a 3/4 pound Triple.  These burgers are on the menu.  The Grand Slam is an off-menu 1 pound quadruple burger that will satiate your desires for a four-patty dose of awesome.  A challenge for many, the Grand Slam is the winner for the meat-lover in your family when they want a burger.\n\nPlus, you can have a Frosty after your burger... something i definitely recommend."
0,Service is awful. Waited over 25 minutes just to have our order taken. There were tables who were seated after us whose orders were taken before us. We were getting ready to walk out when the waitress finally came over. Never again.
2,"Came here on a Saturday night during Divers/Cit\u00e9 with a couple gay guy friends and had a fun time! $4 cover is really reasonable (definitely cheaper than anywhere in Toronto) and the place is massive, with so many rooms to explore. We started on the rooftop patio, which is THE place to be on a nice summer night. It was really crowded, but there were servers circulating so that you don't have to always go up to the bar. The servers were really slow though, but at least they were friendly! There is a hot tub and a small pool. \n\nAs for dancing, there are lots of choices from salsa/bachata on the ground floor to house and hip hop on the 2nd floor. Things pick up around 1am. The house room seemed to be the most popular, although I was not a fan on the DJ. He played each song for a really long time rather than mixing it up... The DJ in the hip hop room was much better. The crowd is predominantly gay but it's also a pretty hetero-friendly place too. The crowd was pretty mixed overall and it doesn't seem like anyone cares who you're with, what you're wearing, whether you're anglophone/francophone etc. as long as you're dancing and having a good time!"
3,Very good Greek salad and chicken tortilla soup.  Much better option than chilli's and other airport restaurants.  I will eat here again.
0,"I used to love Kanpai - great prices, quality food, and an excellent staff. I don't know if it was sold or what they are doing but 'Sushi Ave' is now treading on the classic and established Kanpai name. Prices are higher, portions are smaller, and the quality of the fish is horrid. All my old favorites are gone and the recipes have all changed. \n\nI'm really disappointed to lose one of my favorite sushi bars in Phoenix, but as one of the new staff said 'we have to change it up'. Sadly I won't be back and I don't suggest they be allowed to continue to tarnish such an established name."
2,Parc assez sympa mais sans plus... \npas forcement d'activit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifique a faire \n\nVue magnifique sur Montr\u00e9al\n\net siiinon avec le vent en d\u00e9cembre il fait super froid la haut....
3,"I had expected this place to be a rather small museum, but it is actually quite large and is packed with artifacts and pieces from Native American tribes.  During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyone's attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.  There is a wide range of items on display from dolls to paintings to glass work to clothing and jewelry.  Another cool thing is that this museum allows you to photograph anything that you want."
4,"First let me start off by saying what a wonderful experience my furniture shopping turned out to be! My wife and I moved into our new house and realized we had no furniture to full our 1800 sqft, so we went on down to walker and were greeted but not pestered by many sales people who were eager to ensure we were finding everything to our satisfaction. The sales person whom we actually felt with was a really awesome guy named Richard (I recommend him to anyone reading this), Richard found on standing puzzled near a really huge king size bed set that both my wife and I really liked, we were puzzled because we didn't know how the pricing worked if we wanted to buy only certain pieces rather than the entire set. Richard was very helpful and even got us a 20% discount on an already on sale item and this really surprised my wife and I :) the experience for my wife and I was almost like just running into a friend who also sold furniture becsuse Richard made us really feel at ease so much so that we even invited him to my wife's bday which was the following weekend! The furniture was delivered on time and exactly as promised and we are very very satisfied with our Walker furniture experience and see no other reason to shop anywhere else in the future :) on a side note our sales person didn't make it out to the wife's bday but the following weekend we did get a very thoughtful bday card and a $25 gift card to century theaters as a thank you/happy birthday, I call that a great customer experience!  Thanks Richard and Walker."
1,"This place is just ok at best. I've had Sprinkles cupcakes before and wasn't crazy about them, but I wanted to try their ice cream anyway. I opted for a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream in a cup. I was warned by the guy at the counter that it was very salty. I asked for a taste and did find it on the salty side, so I asked for caramel sauce to make it sweeter and more caramel-y.\n\nThe ice cream was ok - not terrible but not among the best I've had either. As for the caramel sauce, it was on the runnier side and I prefer it thick and more flavorful.\n\nThere is plenty of seating outside but it was just too hot to sit out there on the day we went. Luckily there was counter seating on the cupcake side of the shop. (Ice cream is to the right when you enter; cupcakes to the left.) We had to wipe the counter top though - there were crumbs galore on it. It made no sense to me that they had a bunch of workers waiting to help on the cupcake side (most were not helping customers as there was a lull in foot traffic) and not one of them could wipe down the counter top.\n\nWe returned later in the day with a friend who wanted to try their cupcake ATM, but it was out of service.\n\nThis is one of those places where I can say that I'm glad that I tried it, but I don't feel the need to come back."
1,"The food could have been served hotter, the gyro meat could have been moister and more flavorful, the staff could have been a lot more knowledgeable and friendly, and the soda machine could use more carbonation. Too many other Greek food options in town for me to ever consider returning."
1,"Gosh it hurts to give this place a bad review but I must. \nAt 12:10pm on a payday Friday, this place only had one table when we walked in for lunch.\nThe hostess/waitress told us about the Fish Fry special \""all you can eat fried fish for $12\"". Three out of five people at our table ordered the special. I ordered the chopped steak cooked medium. \nA few minutes later the chef came out to inform us he only had enough fish for two orders but offered to use mahi-mahi for one of the orders. So much for the \""all-you-can-eat\"". \nWhen the fish came they were sizable but no one was impressed. \nBack to my chopped steak - it wasn't chopped. I was served a real steak. It appeared to be a strip steak but it was cooked to rare. It was also tough as hell. I only ate half. \nThe sides were unremarkable. \nThe waitress wanted to know if we wanted to order a pie but then informed us \""we're out of most of them\"". We took a whole French Silk pie that was actually pretty good. It's the only reason the place got a 2 star rating."
3,"Great burger. One of the best fast food burgers I've ever had, right behind 5 guys."
2,"Holy douche bag central!  It's places like these is the reason why I don't frequent Scottsdale too often.  It's full of douche bags.  The hotel is a trendy hotel and people like to be seen at trendy places.  I try to avoid them, but in this case I had no choice.  The rooms are really nice, but definitely not worth the price.  I mean it's Scottsdale people, not a mega metropolis where you can get these room rates.  Try to avoid the pool at all costs because it is full of meat heads and girls who are gold diggers.  But if that's your sort of thing have at it, because I don't want it!"
1,"As the newest location, one is led to think that the nice, modern decor and friendly atmosphere are up to par with their flagship restaurant located on I-17 and Cactus, however, after having experiencing one dine-in with my family, it quickly became apparent that the phony smiles were merely a rouse for an over compensating and all too eager to get you out of their restaurant staff.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down we felt rushed.  We had very little time to decide on drinks, never mind browsing the fairly large menu for what we all wanted to order. It was only after shooing away the waitress four times that we were able to reach a decision as to what we wanted to eat and placed our order.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity waiting for or order to be prepared, my now starving family was brought a single plate of egg rolls, later to be followed by another single plate of pot stickers. At this point we are beginning to see how we are to expect dinner - plate by plate rather than in one complete order. This went on through out the remainder of our dinner, to include the waitress forgetting an entire item we had ordered only to laugh it off and blame it on her ink pen. Yes. You read right. Her. Ink. Pen.\n\nThe food was no where near as good as it's predecessor on Cactus and I-17, and the wait staff left a great deal to be desired.\n\nA few bones found in the sweet and sour pork, dirty stem ware, my wife tripping over a hole in the floor near our table and we FINALLY receive the check and concluded we won't be revisiting that location any time soon.\n\nThe ONLY thing pleasing about this experience was the 15% coupon found on their website."
0,disgusting food rude workers. signs everywhere to not take more food than you can eat/not to wase food to prevent rise in cost....if food was edible i would eat it.  $28 for me n hubby wasted.
4,The blue flame is probably one of their best rolls! They are to die for. Love this place. But I go to the one in Goodyear
1,"Had a layover, was craving a cheeseburger, so I thought this would be the perfect place!\n\nI put in my name, waited 5-10 minutes. The hostesses were giggling and did not seem to care much about customer service. They did not make much eye contact or smile, and seemed to have a bit of an attitude.\n\nWhen I was sat down, took another 5-10 minutes for my server to take my order. I ordered the frenchie (turkey burger). It took another 15-20 minutes to come out. The food was pretty good, but the wait time was way too long (especially for an airport). My server did not come check on me, so I had to get up and grab some silverware myself. My check took another 5-10 minutes after I requested it while eating.\n\nWhile eating, I noticed probably 80% of the servers did not look happy at all. Not a typical \""stressed-cause-it's-busy\"" look, but really a \""I-hate-this-place\"" look. Does not make a pleasant atmosphere when everyone has attitude.\n\nThe tables were also crammed very close to each other. The atmosphere overall was really, even for an airport. Very loud in there.\n\nI would not return. It is 2 stars and not 1 because I usually just give 1 star if the food is inedible...and the actual food was pretty good, although messy."
0,"Requires you the purchase everything from drinks, and extra fees for people who aren't even smoking. Seriously? This place I do not recommend at all. Try a different hookah place."
2,Was told  by promotors that Thursday Haze plays hip hop.. negative! Expect any Vegas club experience.. Super big.. super crowded!\n\nSean Paul performed that night so that was really cool minus the part that I felt like the crowd didn't even know his old songs. Really annoyed me lol
2,"Surprisingly good food.  I only write \""surprisingly\"" because this place positions itself as a Vegas Style BBQ joint, and as a Las Vegas local of 17 years I know that my town isn't known for its 'cue.\n\nThe food is good with a twist of different.  To date I've sampled their pulled pork, quarter chicken (white), and the Sassy Fries.  It's certainly barbecue-y, but not in a Carolina, Memphis, or KC way... so I suppose it is appropriate to ascribe \""Vegas Style\"" to this place.\n\nTheir meat offerings are tender and well-seasoned, and the fries are mighty good, but the one thing that was a bit off-putting was the consistency of the barbecue sauce.  It was, well, watery and thin.  Good, mind you, but quite runny and transparent.\n\nThe next time I go I'm going to ask if they offer dry versions of their meat.  Unfortunately, however, I fear that wet is the only way they prepare their fare.\n\nPrice-wise, the place is pretty cheap, especially when compared to other BBQ joints I've been to around the nation.  \n\nAt any rate, I'd go back if I needed some BBQ in a pinch and didn't have time to drive several miles to Buzz BBQ on West Craig Rd.  I still prefer the way Memphians get it done in Tennessee, but nevertheless..."
0,"Within a couple hours of checking in, we found two BED BUGS! One on each bed, and one of them was crawling next to my sleeping son's head.  We checked out immediately, and had to move our sleeping kids at midnight to a new hotel. The staff was not sympathetic and didnt believe us until we showed them the two bed bugs we killed and saved in a baggie.  We had to argue about our refund and there was no manager on duty.  We left our number and told the front desk that we wanted to speak with the manager, but he or she didn't have the decency to call us back.  We cleaned and inspected all our luggage to make sure the bed bugs didn't get in there. No elevators in the hotel, and we were put on the second floor which is not convenient when you have kids.  There was a weird loud annoying noise that we never could identify.  DO NOT STAY, horrible hotel experience."
2,"This park is hidden in a residential area, so if you're not specifically searching for it, you will miss it.  It's a one-way road from the entrance so, again, be on the look-out for the park.  Parking is plentiful.\n\nOnce you do get to the park, it's nice.  There are two runs, one for large dogs and one for small dogs, though the distinction here is 25lbs up or down while at other parks I've seen it's 35lbs up or down.  \n\nAnyway, the runs are long and fairly wide, and there is seating for the people.  The times I've gone it's always been very quiet, just me, the furball, and maybe another two or three people and dogs.  The people and dogs that I've run into have been really friendly though, so kudos to dog-park hospitality.  \n\nIt's a solid dog park and it asks for returns, I just would like to have more dogs and people present."
2,"All in all I would say that this place was charming. We upgraded our room and had a spectacular view of the Eiffel tower, the pool, and the Bellagio fountains. There were plenty of elevators in this place, and they went quite fast. The food was OK. Casino was small, but that's OK, I won $1000 there. The room was fine, except the bed was uncomfortable and the linens were very rough. I swear I cut up my elbows changing positions in this bed. Internet was an extra $15 A DAY. It is in a good place, too. Kind of in the middle of everything.  And a great place to be is Napoleon's.  At night there is a dueling piano show there that is a good time."
0,Stay away from this medical center unless you have plenty of time and don't mind having your credit ruined.  My insurance company paid them and I paid my copay for one office visit.  So far I've wasted two hours proving the $100 office visit has been paid in full 8 months ago. They are now telling me I have 10 days to pay $206 (instead of the $100) or they will send this to collections. Anyone know of a good attorney?
2,"Wow, an AM/PM that doesn't slam you with fees for using a debit card! Nice. This location was clean, well stocked, but also a bit of a pain to get in and out of. Still this was the first AM/PM store I've visited in the entire Vegas valley that I would go back to. (If Quiktrip ever expands out of Phoenix they would wipe the floor with this place, but I'm just dreaming. At least it's better than any Terrible Herbst location!)"
0,I went once before...it was cold and guess what I guess they don't know what fire is. Because the eggs was served to me cold yet again. And I got up and walked out. I wont pay for bad service nor will I pay for cold food. Don't go to this location. EVER...and if you do remember I told you the eggs would be stone cold :(
4,Oh Seaboat... your delicious fried fish sandwiches and fried okra are more than worth braving some of the most ghetto areas of Champaign in the dead of night...
3,"Great little hang out spot. Full bar, excellent coffee & tea, and great food. Definitely trendy. Good location, right off the light rail. If you're in the phoenix area and in the mood for something different, it's worth it!"
0,"Oh My gosh, This has to be the worst pizza I have in 20 years. I tried the 4.99 deal to try the slices and I ordered a slice with sausage and one pepperoni, I was told only one topping for lunch special. I bought a drink from fountain, it had no ice and the pop tasted odd!  I decided to glance at the kitchen since no one was in pizza place at 12:30 (lunch ???), and saw the kitchen help put sausage on my pizza slice with no gloves on. Now what was this weird taste of this slice, Oh the dough was frozen and then baked, the sauce from a bag or can at best and the cheese was tasteless. I am not even mentioning the terrible meat. The place also had a weird smell coming through vents??  I hate Pizza Hut with a passion and I wished I had the pizza from Pizza Hut that use to occupy this location if I did it would been 100% better that what I had."
2,"We had pasta carbonara and a melt burger.  Found a peanut in the burger (?), fries were good (even better dipped in their blue cheese dressing).  The burger was pretty good, don't think I'd get it again.   I'm finding I don't like Grand Lux pasta sauces."
1,"This place functions like a Chinese sit-down restaurants where all the items are meant to be shared. Almost all the menu items have a small (serves 2 people) and a large (serves 4 people). That's all and good, but it has an issue: it's a lie. \n\nMy buddy and I ordered a small pizza... But we both agreed that we could have eaten that small pizza by ourselves and be satisfied. A small item and a side is sufficient food for two adults. \n\nAnother issue is that it took an inordinate amount of time for a waiter to even service us."
4,"Ihave been bringing my cat Squishee here for a year or two now and I have to say, I am always impressed with Dr. Grossman's knowledge and his mild, calm demeanor when handling my Squishee kitty! Squishee is 16 years old and the staff always make a big to do about his arrival and treat him so good! \n\nI am getting ready to take my other ca, much younger, named Basil to him for his first annual with Dr. Grossman. I definitely trust this clinic's opinions and values when it comes to my pet's well being. 5 STARS!!!"

0,dont deliver then don't offer it ... thats all i have to say
2,"The buffet was good. It's probably one of the price-friendly ones. It honestly didn't cost me an arm and a leg. With the remodeling done there, it was a little hard to find the buffet. It's underground... kinda-sorta. The hosts don't really pay attention to the people eating and randomly changing tables. So, it gets annoying if you have a party of 6 and this party of 4, who's already on their 3rd plates, decide to move to a roomier table. Yeah, not cool.\n\nADVISORY:\nGet there early, in a blink of an eye... the lines are crazy."
0,"Man, we were robbed. We ordered from this place last night and we were sooo stoked when they said they'd be here in under an hour, awwww yeah. Then we heard the price, kinda steep for 3 items but whatevs, delivery charges and what not.  If the food was decent it wouldve totally been worth it. So flash forward 45 mins (awwwyeah) the delivery driver shows up and its a little old lady, and its cold as fuck, hence my distaste for leaving the house.  I was expecting some strudy human being at this time of night, in this neighborhood, in this weather, its all cold and she has a cough. Omg. Who the fuck would send their mom out in this cold?! You monster! So naturally my dear sweet southern fiancee tips more than we were originally gonna, how could you not? He was held at gun point by his sense of morality (...and the fact that hes a huge mamas boy). So then we sit down to eat... I couldve forgiven the dry, almost cold fries, the super hard bread on the sub... sure the chicken fingers were alright.... but they gave us two fucking mozzarella sticks... two...of the worst prepared mozzarella sticks I have ever had the misfortune of clogging my arteries with. Like... 6zillion nasty deepfried mushrooms and zuccini...and 2...fucking...mozzarella sticks. Worst fucking \""sampler platter\"" ever. Yeah. \nTldr...\nPaid a lot of money, tipped even more. .. food was not good...then they squashed my soul. My fat girl soul. Just ripped away any hope I had left to participate in delicious activities... all hope was lost. The SS delicious late night delivery food sank to the bottom of the crappy food sea."
0,Food is barely edible......service is spotty and the place has a reputation for padding the bills and scooping up cash that does not belong to them
0,"Horrible! What a dump, wen there just for our kids and checked out thee next day! Was put into a dirty room with laundry bags, had to be moved and therefore cause us to miss the only real dinner for the night, the arcade is run down, none of the machines work and the ones that do u have to wait for attendants to pay u out"
0,"I WILL NEVER USE VEGAS.COM OR STAY AT CAESARS\nWe were booked to stay here 7/3 for 2 nights & left after the 1st. The bathroom fixtures were rusted, the bottom of the door was broken & coming apart, urine had ate away at the marble around the toilet the grout around the tub was dirty & moldy. The other doors were 1.5 inches from reaching the floor, we could see out into the hall & into the adjoining room. the air conditioner was very clanking. They sent someone to fix it which was no help. They switched our room to an nicer room that had 1/2 the crystals stolen off the wall sconce chandelier. The blanket had a big hole in it & the lighting was too dim to apply my make-up. We asked where the buffet was & they said it had been closed for month & vegas.com should have told us & they didn't. They suggested we go to Flamingo's buffet which was closed for 4 hours due to a water problem. We then walked to Paris who's buffet was open but were out of food. No meat, no fresh cooked veggies. The salad bar was old wilted lettuce with no tomatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes or other fresh veggies. At least the Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian was outstanding. I will never stay at Caesars and never book from Vegas.com & will tell everyone i know to avoid both of these when booking a Vegas get away"
1,"I went here to do some gambling off the Strip.  I lost just as much money here playing the slots as I did on the Strip which disappointed me.  I was expecting at least just slightly better odds?  Oh well.  Also, too many of the slot machines are right near the doors and I was there when it was cold outside.  The waitresses ignored me (it would have been nice to at least be ASKED if I wanted a drink).  We ended up getting food at TGIFriday's because everything else had a super long line.  So overall I regretted leaving the Strip for this experience."
1,The market is perhaps okay.  It is however very tiny.  I was not that impressed.  Did not buy anything as I did not see anything that I wanted.
0,"My dad gave me a groupon for this place, he was too jetlagged to go and I was more than happy to sign up for the free dinner. I made reservations, however I was told that their reservations were backed up until 9:00 pm. I confirm that time, and show up at 8:50. It's a madhouse, with people packing the tiny corridor leading from the bar to the restaurant. The greeter was screaming at the top of her lungs for people, managing to sound pretty pissed off in the process. \n\nWe were seated at 9:55, and this was after a handful of people in front of us left because of the wait. We sat around for a few minutes before someone slapped this cup of butter on the table. Me and my date sat transfixed. Was the butter ornamental? Would it go good with a dash of pepper? We stared at this shot glass full of butter for a full fifteen minutes before someone gave us bread. We were seated with two other tables simultaneously, and while we waited for our appetizer, the first table was on their entrees. The second table was polishing off their appetizer while we munched on prison bread. The butter didn't help much.\n\nI got the filet, medium rare. Completely raw in the middle, mostly raw for the rest of it. Baked potato was microwaved. A baked potato will be crispy on the outside. This is a direct result of the baking. A microwaved potato will be one big rubbery mess that slides around your plate. \n\nWe chose the peach melba for dessert. It was melted soft serve ice cream topped with cool whip and canned peaches. There were a few raspberries, but after the first one's extreme sourness I decided to leave the rest to drown in vanilla soup. The blueberries were completely devoid of any flavor, good or bad. If you've ever eaten paper, you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nAt the end, we were presented our check boasting that we would have had to pay $89.99 for this travesty. It was to show how much we should tip. The waitress was absent for most of the night, the service took forever, the reservations were an hour delayed, and the food was awful. The tip wasn't much.\n\nA few other notes. The interior is weird. I can figure why-- this is a dive tavern that someone picked up on the cheap for the nice location. They threw in a few large windows facing the city and left the rest to rot. I was able to carbon date the carpet back to the paleolithic age, when orange and green was in style. Every flat surface is full of drywall stalactites, which adds a nice sex-dungeon flair to the place. A fake fireplace crackles and flickers orange. The bathroom is worse than most I've seen barhopping on East Carson St., and if you've ever been to East Carson Street you know what I'm talking about."
1,"We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I doubt I'll go back.  This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.\n\nUpon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).\n\nAt first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.\n\nThe staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.\n\nMy girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.\n\nWhile there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.  I truly expected more from this Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel."
0,"This place is bait n switch unless you know what crooks you are working with and know how to handle them . Of course I'll share my experience and give you some tips !\n\nSome customers literally took 30-45 minutes at the counter while the clerks here tried to up sell every thing possible, gps, gas, insurance, car seat to people who obviously have no kids . Time is money! Efficiency is key! 2 sayings that have never been uttered in this building obviously.\n\nPeople you know they will ask you for your drivers license and credit card... Have it ready before you are next in line . Also have your confirmation number pulled up on your phone or on your print out ready to go... Come on!\n\nWhen I heard those golden words \""Next customer\"" I felt like I hit the lotto. I passed the confirmation number to the clerk which was pulled up on my phone, and handed her my license and credit card. The next thing she said was do you was basic or premium coverage. Wait... What did u just ask me? What kinda question was that? Did you really just try to pull a fast one on me? Is that what they teach you during your training !!? Is that how you tricked those poor young girls into speaking with you for 45 minutes, holding up the line that was already going out the door?? I snapped back at her I don't want any coverage, no extras, I'll get my own gas, nothing additional!! My contract was printed immediately and I was out within 1-2 minutes. I think I set a record that day for being the fastest one out of the rental counter.\n\nComplaints about taking 2 shuttles you say... If you look at the location, you can see they are obviously located further away than most rental agencies..\n\nYes I'm herra asian so I will be back here to save my $40, but don't get tricked into any up charges and don't let these folks waste your time either. Come prepared !"
3,"Not sure if it is because it is located within walking distance of where I live, the fact that its on the water, the free wifi, the delish coffee or the off-the hook ambiance, but this place has my heart!!  The place is located on Lakeside street which the area appears to be residential then there is this area of retail right in the middle. Super cool.\n\nCoffee in a mug-$2.23 \nThis is all I had on this visit but, will be back for the scones. There is an area set up with a couch, coffee table and book shelf where you can look directly out the window which overlooks Monona Bay.There are several tables out back on the deck and some tables outside in the front that face the street.  Every other Friday there is acoustic guitar and the bar serves wine and beer.  I have  yet to get down here and check it out. The coffee house is also open Wed-Sun (look up hours on website) evenings serving wine and beer. Summer Blush is only $4 a glass!!  Whoaaaa!!!\n\nIf you are taking a walk or bike ride around Monona Bay, this place is right on your way. Stop and take a break!!"
1,"Food is pretty good. Its kind of a late night teen hang out spot. \n\nThis one chick that works there is really rude. She never smiles, never even says hello when you walk in, and I kind of think shes a bit racist? I am white.. never once is has she been nice to me. But my bff is of Mexican decent.. and shes always supper sweet to her. if you come in often, you know exactly who I'm talking. She should not be working in a place where you have to be face to face with people. Rude person."
1,"Not the best place to get your toes done. They use cheap polish, mine smudged like an hour after I left the shop. The massage chairs are nice and they do have plenty of great magazines. Just go here if your desperate!"
1,"Nice hotel, but beware if you suffer from hot flashes or you prefer a cold room!  The thermostats in their rooms are locked so they will not go below 68 degrees.  I have never come across this situation in all my years of traveling. Seriously, the hallway was cooler than my room! Don't get me wrong ... 68 is a fine and dandy temperature, but I happen to be dealing with pre-menopausal symptoms, including those delightful hot flashes. 68 was not going to cut it. \n\nI called the front desk and the phone rang about 37 times before I gave up and tried the operator.  I asked the operator for the \""secret phone line at the front desk that they actually pick up,\"" which she gave me and the indifferent clerk finally answered.  I asked for a fan in my room, but they do not provide those for guests.  What a big fat jip!  \n\nWe had to change our plans for the evening since we had to check out and scurry around Boulder Hwy looking for another room for the night, which ate up an hour of our party time.  GRRRRR!  Ended up at the Super 8 motel on Boulder Hwy, which is a bit of a dive, but at least their a/c puts out!"
0,Two dollars and a dirty look from the teenage girl cashier for a bottled water. Good times.
1,"Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. \n\nThe brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. \n\nSo here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. \n\nIt just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. \n\nNot sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch."
3,"the chicken fingers swept me away! i never went to wingstop cuz i hate chicken wings, but when forced to go with an associate, I had to admit after eating those fingers, I shall return to try all flavors (except the hot ones)."
0,"How in the world can you mess up spare ribs? Or chicken? Or the rice in sushi? Come on Treasure Island! What the heck? I've been to many, many buffets in Vegas and hands down, this is the worst I've ever been to. Granted, I went during lunch time so I can't comment on quality or value during dinner, but this was absolutely horrible.\n\nThe good:\n(Total 3 stars)\nDesserts were actually pretty good. Red velvet cupcake, pineapple upside down miniature cake, very good cookies, real Dreyers Grand ice cream. And, oh, they didn't mess up the ice tea. The mashed sweet potato was very good. \n\nThe bad:\n(Total -2 stars)\nWow...where do I begin. Okay, I rarely ever eat sushi at these buffets but since they had no shrimp or crab or mussels or any other seafood during lunch time despite a $20.95 price tag, but I was desperate for anything somewhat fishy. How do I describe the rice? Let me see...a cross between spoiled pudding, 5 day old rice, and concrete grounds. I actually just took the small pieces of fish and shrimp on this sad excuse of sushi rice, ate the fish and used the rice to build a pyramid on my plate. Yes, I've eaten at AYCE sushi buffets so I don't equate them to sushi restaurants, but my goodness this was horrid. Pork ribs? Well, they display real oak wood behind the serving counter at the bbq area, but it's not oak-fired ribs. It was artificial smoke flavor...and it was putrid. Holy cow...it didn't last .5 of a millisecond in my mouth. It was that bad. How in the world can a piece of spare rib be that bad? It tasted like gasoline...and it may have been. You get the idea. Food was old (like left over from the previous day or something, not fresh). Here's the kicker: despite 2 for 1 coupons and/or 2 free buffets, the breakfast and lunch lines were very minimal. The hotel guests probably read the reviews about this buffet and stayed away. Me? I thought maybe I could save $50 by going to this buffet with the 2 free coupons and invest it elsewhere. Bad decision. The insult is they actually charge $20.95 for this buffet to those who don't have coupons. They should PAY people $20.95 for coming to eat there. I should thank my stars that I at least got fed for free BUT when you're on vacation in Vegas and you have to make meals count cuz there are only 3 meals a day you should at least enjoy your meal. This buffet was horrible, putrid, old, stanky, and absolutely insulting. A Vegas buffet shouldn't be this bad. The downtown Vegas buffets were even better than this for 1/3 the cost. Treasure Island, please wake up, and guests STAY AWAY from this buffet. First time I've stayed at this hotel, and the rooms were actually pretty good, but the buffet actually ruined the experience."
2,I love the layout of it.. I'm sweet tooth person but I would not go heads over heel in this place.. I don't like lollipops so I didn't get it even though it was bling out...\n\nI tried the red velvet brownie.. Fail! I couldn't finish it and it was just too much. And this is coming from a girl who loves sweet stuff.. Tried the cupcake.. I think Sprinkles is better
0,"i wouldn't give this company another dime. Not only did they have the saddest selection of produce i have ever seen, but the customer service was a joke. \n\nI am all about eating organic and gluten free, and i'm always in search of a fun new health food for my family to try. I went into Whole Food so excited because it was like a health food Costco. I was never once greeted, and i literally got dirty looks from a few of the people stocking shelves. \n\nI felt horribly unwelcome and my shopping experience was uncomfortable to say the least. i ended up buying 3 things because i put most everything in my cart back, and i wanted nothing more than to just leave. I don't even like to drive by that store....\n\nI hope the managers of this store read this and consider a complete staff overview, because this is no way for any store to operate."
0,"So these guys were meant to finish putting my tires on in 45 minutes, yeah? Thus my hiatus to Culver's, yeah? Hoping that on my return in 45 minutes, my car would have two brand new 255/95R18's on as they quoted, yeah? It didn't quite happen that way! \n     I strolled back from Culver's ready to drive off....but the numbers on my invoice were not the ones I paid for... they put on some tires that cost 90 bucks each, when I paid for 280 each for two!  Not sure why they did this....were they hoping that I would drive off not realizing since I'm female? ? ?"
4,"There really isn't much more to say, because you can see how awesome this place is from my original review. Or from the reviews of others.\n\nI came in for the Yelp Eats UYE, and went to town by crushing some mad food.\n\nOn this particular night, I had the Yellowtail Sashimi, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, and for dessert, another appetizer....the Teeter Tots. Yes, two entrees, and an appetizer for dessert. It was that damn good.\n\nDon't waste time reading any more reviews. Just go. Nobuo. Now."
2,"Wow this deep Pittsburgh Italian in our own Little Italy (Bloomfield) offers up big food and has more menu offers than a Sunday newspaper.  We went on a Monday night which happens to be buffet night- I opted out- they had everything from sausage to wings with a salad bar- a deal at $8 including a drink but I can't think about all u can eat and the food in steaming chafing pans did not look too good.  I opted for the two for $20 deal off the menu- we had eggplant parm it turned out to be a eggplant lasagna but was tasty and large- half went home and chicken picatta- also huge- half went home- dinner included soup, pasta, salad and dessert-   They ruined the angle hair pasta-  ravioli was OK- problem with pasta was overcooked- other than that the rest of the meal was good, enough food for an army and service was pleasant.  The ballgame was on.  The place was packed and it is worth a visit- very Pittsburgh, not a gourmet experience but a far cry from Olive Garden. For dinner and lunch the next day this place is a winner."
3,"We stayed here for a few nights in the summer. Check-in was easy, and they upgraded our room to a very spacious suite. The amenities were excellent, and it was nice to come back to a comfortable, quiet room after spending a lot of time (And money) on The Strip!"
3,"I organized a no-host dinner here in June 2014.  They were very accommodating over the phone, taking my reservation for 25 and not hesitating when I called a few days later increasing it to 35.  What they didn't tell me was that they wouldn't have all of the tables ready at our reservation time.  We had one large table in the middle of a room but it wasn't big enough for all of our guests.  People had to stand around and wait until diners finished and their tables/booths became available.  It was a casual group so people took it in stride, but it was a bit stressful for me as the organizer until everyone had a seat.\n\nThe wait staff was very efficient and made sure they had a drink and dinner order for every guest.  This was more difficult than you would imagine as we had people up and about, visiting with people at other tables.  I heard nothing but compliments about all of the entrees ordered and I know that my mole was quite delicious.\n\nOne more comment about the restaurant -- it is quite loud.  Between all of the conversations and the wandering mariachi band, you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  This is not good or bad -- the place is quite festive.  But if you are looking for something more subdued then this isn't the place for you.\n\nOverall we really enjoyed this restaurant and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people going to visit Vegas."
1,"Love the vibe and look of the place.  Seats all around the place (inside and outside).  The coffee smells were so good!!!  We came here for treats after dinner.  We were greeted by the guy working in the behind the counter.  He told us to grab a seat and a waiter will be with us.  Cool!  \n\nWe sat for about 5 to 7 mins before someone came by.  We noticed some of the tables were a little dirty and an employee cleaned the table by wiping with his sleeves.  We finally got our orders in and the drinks and gelatos came out slow.  Only 3 of us had our stuff with the other 2 staring at us.  The homemade gelato was great.  Everyone said the drinks were good.  \n\nService is slow, place needs to tidy up, & the restrooms were pretty dirty too."
3,It's hard to pass by the bellagio and not stop for the free show. Each one is unique and well done.
3,"Having grown up in hong kong and Singapore, I must admit their dim sum is excellent and a great value for money. Staffed with a primarily Cantonese speaking staff adds to the authenticity. \n\nFood wise, most of it tastes as good as the regular restaurants I grew up with in Asia. Their egg tarts have the best pastry skin I've ever had in America and is even better than many in Asia. The only downside is their steamed BBQ pork bun doesn't taste that good, perhaps due to a poor supply of pork in this area. Fried buns are excellent though.\n\nValue wise, this is one of the cheapest dim sum restaurants I've been to in the US. To sum it up, an excellent choice and great value."
4,"This is a great lunch option! Quick and reasonably priced. I really like their tacos and the guacamole is delicious!! Lots of fresh toppings!!  For meat, definitely recommend the pulled pork and steak!  Chicken was so-so...kind of bland. Service is fast and friendly."
3,"What the Inn lacks in amenities, it more than makes up with it's ambiance. This is no Joe's, Legends, or Brothers. While Ed is correct that lately, it seems like there's more patrons wearing vertical striped oxford shirts and square toed shoes on their way to Brother's, they don't tend to stick around too long. If you get there early, you can grab a table, toss some darts, and get your songs played on the internet jukebox. \n\nMost of the bartenders are polite, patient, and fun. However, there's one beast of a woman who enjoys berating people who aren't the fastest Mug Club pledges... but hey, you asked for it anyway. \n\nIf you come to visit Champaign, you simply MUST join the 60,000 member mug club, and take in some of the history at the Inn... It's a Champaign institution."
1,What the hell happened to this place...maybe I'm being a stickler about a buffet but this is just depressing.  No fried calamari......All the food is cold at the start of dinner.  Crab legs are like dried up carrots...never again.
0,"Holy heck! This place was beyond bad. One star is too much. We were heading out of town for the afternoon and decided to stop off at Santa Fe Station for brunch. Our intention was to hit the buffet but the line was too long. The Grand Cafe was right there and didn't look too busy so we decided to just eat there. Now it is Saturday so the place wasn't empty but it wasn't terribly crowded as far as Saturdays go. We walked right up to the hostess, told her there were five of us. She said to wait while she found a table. I could see plenty of empty tables but whatever. While we were waiting, the manager came out and asked, \""How many?\"" I responded, \""Someone is already helping us. She went to find a table.\"" The manager then very rudely snapped at me, \""How many?\"" I told him five and then he turned away from me and started talking to another hostess. Meanwhile our hostess came back and led us to a table. \n\nOur server showed up right away to take our drink orders and then she disappeared. It took a very, very long time to get our drinks. While I'm on the drinks...the kids' menu showcased two drinks. They were very large photographs. There were no other drinks mentioned anywhere on the kids menu. When we placed our drink order my two youngest each ordered one of those drinks. We were told they are not part of the kids meal and we'd be charged extra. The drinks also showed up in regular glasses instead of the kids cups with lids. I found this very weird and misleading. Why showcase both drinks on the kids menu if they are not kids drinks?? My orange juice tasted really sour as if it were old. \n\nWe placed our order and waited, and waited and waited. A server for a nearby table saw my look of death and came over to assure me our order was being put on a tray right then. She'd just seen it was up and ready. Yeah, right. We continued to wait and wait and wait. Finally, our server showed up and apologized saying that the corporate chef was there. I have no idea what that means or why that means service is so slow. I was just happy to have our food. We had plans out of town and our tickets required us to be there at a specific time. We were now running late. \n\nOk, so the food...bleh!! It was sooo bad! My oldest son ordered the french toast. It was so soggy it was dough. My youngest ordered pancakes that were not cooked through. My husband had the same issue. My hashbrowns were the most disgusting I'd ever had...ever. They were bland mush. I specifically ordered an omelet without mushrooms. It had mushrooms. I had ordered a side of fruit. It came with tastless melon and one strawberry that had been quartered to give the illusion that i got more than one. Nice try. My husband ordered a side of bacon and it never came. We spent maybe five minutes with our food before giving up and deciding just to leave.  \n\nThis was truly a terrible experience and possibly the worst we've had in our four years in Las Vegas. We will not go back."
3,"Stopped in Sunday after the recommendation of a friend.  It was blazing hot outside and the A/C in my house wasn't keeping up with it, so I needed a cold beer, cool air, and sports.  This is the place.  I would call this a true sports bar.  Great atmosphere, very friendly and attentive bar tenders, and pleanty of TV's with a wide variety of sports shown.  Just what I was looking for.  Oh yeah, the A/C worked perfectly too. \n\nI had a pizza while watching two baseball games and the golf tournament. The pizza was pretty good, not great, but I ate it all so it was good enough.  Great crust.  The menu seemed to have some other things that looked good. I heard somebody down the bar mention the Calzone was good so next time.  Another guy had some good looking wings too.\n\nJust as I was leaving, a major thunder storm blew up so I turned around and had another beer.  \n\nGreat place to hang out and have a few brews and a bite while watching a game.   I'll be back very soon."
4,"I'll make this brief, because one of the previous reviewers just wrote a very comprehensive review of this little gem of a restaurant! \n\nThe housemade tofu is a revelation! First try it with the special Hokkaido sea salt blend, and then with the shredded bonito and scallions and ginger, with a little bit of the homemade soy sauce drizzled on top. Wow!\n\nWe tried dishes from all across the menu, from the asparagus okaki (fried with a crispy panko? crust) to the delicious kobe skewers -- thank you previous reviewer, you were so right about that beef -- to the whole fish prepared two ways. We chose sea bream, a very small, delicately flavored fish. It came sashimi'd first, then the other half of the fish was grilled. Beyond delicious.\n\nMy kids are so jealous because Raku had grilled rice balls, a real country-style treat that we used to have all the time when they were children. Yum!\n\nThe service and atmosphere were wonderful. We sat in a kaiseiki room, which was an intimate dark wood booth. Clientele ranged from locals (we overheard the staff greeting a regular saying they were worried because he always came in at 9 PM and he was a few minutes late!) to a group of Japanese businessmen to a couple with a young baby. All were treated excellently and all seemed to really enjoy their experience at Raku. We will be back.\n\nNote: it is a small restaurant, with about a dozen tables, so be sure to call in advance for reservations. It is a short taxi ride from the Strip hotels, and the staff at the restaurant was more than happy to call a taxi for us at the end of our meal."
1,"Came by here again on a slow weeknight hoping for a better experience. While the food was better this time around, they were once again missing several menu items and the service was still extremely rude, slow, and inattentive. Sad to learn that these problems are systemic and were not just the result of the Restaurant Week crowds. I won't be giving them a third chance."
3,"The venue is very original with a unique and beautiful interior design. Food is great but not always(i do not recommend the lasagna), portions are really big relative to their prices."
3,"Really great atmosphere and friendly staff. \n\nWe were on a quest for the best chocolatine in Montreal and this was our first stop! \nThis was tasty and served warm! However, it was a little smaller than others and nothing really stood out about it. It tied for 3rd in our final tally.\n\n(As a sidenote, if you don't speak French and what is brought to you doesn't look like what you expected, ask! Don't eat it assuming you are incorrect, as we did.)"
0,"I have stayed in the Luxor many years ago and it was actually pretty nice. I knew the place had gotten old and only booked the room because I was in town for a convention at the MGM which is right across the street. I was prepared for the room to be average and not so nice so my low scores are not based on that. I wasnt expecting a 5 star stay, but what happened over the course of the week was disgusting and so wrong! \n\nFirst of all Ammenities: \n- Rooms are old and out dated\n - Furiture was scratched and broken in some places\n -Bedding was comparible to a motel six \n- NO WIFI! \n- No central A/C so the room doesnt get cold.\n\nok now lets move on to the real reason I will NEVER stay here and will warn everyone I know not to. My Macbook Laptop was stolen from my room while I was out all day. I left my room at 7:00am when I returned at 11pm the laptop was gone. I searched everywhere before calling to file a complaint. They sent up a security officer who had me fill out a voluntary statement.\n\n Once that was done I realized I had no way to charge my cell phone, because I was using the outlet on my laptop. I went to the front desk and asked for a manager. I explained to him that my laptop had been stolen from my room and I had just filled out a report, but that I have no way to charge my cell phone and was hoping the hotel could let me borrow one for the remainder of my stay. The manager was so rude!! He told me that I could go to security and see if they have a charger in lost and found, why would they give me someone elses property! I told him I am not familiar with the hotel can he show me where to go. He pointed into the casino floor, never even looked up. I told him I couldnt believe after being stolen from in their hotel that he was not more willing to assist me in which he replied \"" look lady if I had a charger in this drawer id give it to you, but i dont. Itd not my fault you cant charge your phone.\"" WOW you would think he could have at least walked me over to security to try to help me. \n\nI eventually found the security station. They told me they have a charger but I would have to plug it in and wait for it to charge! 6 hour wait and its 2 in the morning. I told her I have to get up at 5am and cannot wait, so she suggested I leave my phone there. WHAT! after my property was just stolen! I ended up having to buy a $45 charger from the gift shop. \n\nOn top of that when I went back to my room to get into bed the sheets had chocolate stains all over. I called the front desk who told me they could have a sheet change done in 90 mins. I told her I could not wait that long as I needed to get some rest and had a big day the next day is there any one who could come sooner. She replied that they have limited house keeping and I shouldnt expect so much, there isnt anything I can do. WOW! \n\nThe next day my husband came to join me, when he arrived he came to the valet. The valet told him the lot was full and he couldnt not park. I was on the phone with him walking to greet him- my husband said I am a guest here is there another place I can park myself. The valet said no this is your only option, but if you give me $100 I'll work it out for you. I told my husband do not give him any money I will be right there with a manager. While I was waiting for the manager the valet was telling my husband you better move your car or I'll make you move it. My husband replied to him trust me you dont want me to get out of this car..when the manager came to help me he told me that there is self parking around the back....WHY did the valet tell us that....loh yeah because he is trying to STEAL $100 from us!!! The manager did nothing and told us he has to side with his staff. \n\nAt the end of the day nothing was done about any of this. The manager we spoke to at check out was rude and unhelpful I asked them to refund the room and was actually asked why would we do that? was there anything you didnt get that was promised? WOW how about common customer service and all of my belongings with me during check out. \n\nAlso regarding my laptop I have called risk management over 10 times and no one has called me back. I finally got a hold of someone yesterday who told me the only person who used a key besides myself was the maid. They said she told them she didnt take it so the investigation is closed. \n\nThere are so many great places to stay in Vegas the Luxor is not one of them. I made sure the 16,000 people at my convention about what happened to me and I warn anyone reading this to spare themselves the same experience I had."
4,One of the most fun relaxing places in town \nI love it here!\nGreat drinks and great food \nExcellent nachos !
4,"When I was a kid I used to love to go to the Hardware store to go looking at stuff and talk to the nice people that worked there.. WHen I visit this location of Ace I feel I go back in time. \nThey are super nice, super helpful but do not smoother you... They know how to make keys that work ( hard to find these days I have learned). I feel comfortable asking questions here as well. They never treat me like \""Oh you are a girl\"". I think their prices are not too bad and you get much better quality like screw that will not strip etc.. \n Parking is awesome here for people who are handicapped or have  a bad back you can park like right near the door practically.."
3,"I have to downgrade a star, because last time I was here - my favorite portabello veggie beer bread has been changed to have broccoli and carrots instead of the artichoke hearts, onions, mushrooms, sprouts and tomatoes. It was very disappointing, bland and definitely NOT what I want on a veggie sandwich. This is the first time I left my leftovers at Four Peaks because the sandwich wasn't worth taking home. \nAltogether, still awesome beer/patio, etc., but really sad about the move to go to cheap, bland vegetables in my sandwich."
3,"Didnt stay here, but swung in on my way to the airport to return the car.  \n\nThought it was great. Had more 3 face suited cards on draw here, than at all casinos combined over the last four days (gold coast, fremont hotel, 4 queens, rio, the d, nugget). \n\nHad great time working the poker machines and slots.  Got a players card quickly and easily via the DMV insert kiosk.  Date had a fun time playing blackjack.  Gift shop has pizza, booze, snacks, and unassuming gifts. Who wouldnt want a silver sevens shot glass (chick collects em like 400 plus).  \n\nAnyway, didnt have a chance to sample all the amenities. Sport bar looked good. Sports book even better. Plenty of parking out front (granted 1pm ona Tuesday). Id like to stay there. Something different. Love the nice restaurant selection nearby, eg, hoffbrau house, italian, fogo de chou (brazilian all you can eat steak house.)  Double down saloon dive bar nearby and naked city pizza."
0,"I had never made it to this show in 10 years of trips to Vegas, now that I have I wish I had done something else. It is similar to a lame theme park show, maybe good for kids but not worth the time for an adult. If you happen to be walking by, sure stop and watch but don't make a special trip."
3,Wow I love to Thrift shop. It's so fun to go to Goodwills when I'm traveling. So many different things. This store was huge! So much bigger then the ones near my home town. I could have spent along time going through the clothes. They were very busy Nd there racks were stuffed. The prices are doubled compared to my hometown Goodwills. Maybe because it's Vegas. Shirts in my area run for 3.95 a piece this store look liked 5 dollars and up. Still reasonable but that is my only complaint.
3,"That's a lot of money for a b urger. but the wine was ok.\n\ntime for sleep. \n\nnight\n\nand oh, it was for charity right?"
4,"Awesome pizza, family-owned. Never fails to please an office full of hungry men!"
0,"I like Hugo Boss, I own many articles of clothing that are Hugo Boss.\n\nI can't go into this store.\n\nThey pump some random candle scent into the whole thing.\n\nLet me explain something basic to you retail geniuses out there. If you want to do something that sets you apart, make sure it does not have the potential to backfire.\n\nSome people are sensitive to smell. Pumping a scent into your store, unless it's fresh-baked cookies, crepes, bacon or other delicious food item, can only potentially shoo people away.\n\nYou cater primarily to men. Why in the world would you pump in a FLORAL scent?\n\nI will never shop at a Hugo Boss outlet as long as you keep pumping this scent in. Whoever the brainiac was that thought this was a good idea should be fired."
4,"We had a wedding lunch here a week ago.  The food was delicious and very nicely presented.  Susan (the owner) was great to work with and went the extra mile to ensure we had a wonderful experience on an exciting day!  Susan accommodated our needs and was very helpful and flexible during the planning process.  \n\nFor those of you looking for a unique and fun option for special events in the Gilbert area, especially those looking for something close to the LDS Temple, this proved to be a great option.  Susan accommodated almost 100 people.  \n\nThe pulled pork and chicken salad sandwiches were excellent!  The pasta salad and fruit salad was spot on!  This was followed by a variety of \""house\"" specialty desserts which were to die for!  We give Susan and her help at The Gilbert House a well deserved recommendation!"
1,"A friend and I stopped here last night to grab a bite to eat and a sundae. The wait to get a table was long so we decided to do the grab and go window. The grab and go has a limited menu but still had some decent choices. The line moved fairly quickly, and and the person taking orders was plesant enough. \n\nIt took about 15 minutes to get our order, 2 corn dogs and a chicken cobb salad. The corn dogs were hot and fresh. The salad, well it left a lot to be desired. The tomatos looked dead and the corn, well i didn't see much. \n\nI would recommened to stick to the sunades."
3,"I was really worried about going on any vacation without the dogs and didn't think it was possible!\n\n I didn't want to burden family and friends. Also, I'm \""that person\""- that stresses what my dogs eat  and most of our friends \""free feed\"" commercial crap or have stuff out that may be an issue with our dogs (like kids leaving cheetos out, kids toys, pens, stuffed toys, etc) and they not realize it until it's torn to bits.\n\nOn the other hand, I am really apprehensive about leaving them to some strangers. Everyone has that nightmare thought of what if a place will neglect them and just care about the money?  \n\nAfter so much hub bub of researching and asking around, I decided to pop in with my dogs to see how they would react to the people and the place. They seemed fine so we booked out trip. \n\nThey give you a webcam address that you can access on your computer or there is a phone app to access their feed. Mind you the cameras are still and do not show the whole room so sometimes your dog may be on the fringes like mine were. Unfortunately those two were mostly on the fringes so I had to check often to even see where they are and would get a few moments of seeing them run onto screen and run back out of range. Still nice to see them and general monitor the facility. I saw people come in and sit on the couches and pet all the dogs so it was nice to see they were friendly to the dogs and the dogs were happy to see them whenever they were there. \n\nThey seem okay when we got them, but passed out as soon as we got home. Figured, even though they slept and all there it wasn't the relaxed sleep they get being next to me. \n\nI had a groupon to use with a bath and brush grooming so I asked if I can have their nails trimmed too while they get groomed. Theirs was very long and I get nervous about trying to cut my girl down short with her black nails. They didn't take much off, just the tips so it didn't feel like it was worth $8 each when at the vets they cut it down to be short.  \n\nI got their food bags back and only half their food has been used. Remember how I said I was really freakish about their food diet? Well, I measured out portions for all the days plus one extra days worth incase. They put it in a bag so I didn't see until I got home or I might have asked about it. I don't know if they weren't eating because they're nervous or that 1 cup meals was misunderstood between both and not each since I just made a big bag with both their names on it and measurement directions. \n\nWhen we picked them up, all the feedback we got from the lady was they \""did great and were fine\"". If they weren't eating then I don't think so and I should have been told as it can be useful to know in case I board them again. More details than that would have been nice since I've never boarded them there, never left them with anyone EVER. \n\nI think overall this place is decent though. I like that the camera feed is given and the access is 24/7 (some shut it after the place closes for the night). The price is just right and great value for multiples. Many places only charge PER DOG and here there are multiple dog prices. I boarded two for $45 (average in other places is $30-$40 per dog). My dogs seem to not be unhappy being there and approached staff on camera so they had to be treated well. One of my dogs is skittish and if she was not treated well by someone, she will usually space herself from that person. \n\nI will be using them again for boarding as I at least feel comfortable knowing that my dogs are okay with this place and the staff."
1,"In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet. \nI had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \""For this?\"" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery. \nI sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap. \nSo I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much. \nAll the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe. Stay away if you're used to eating at the Chinese buffet."
2,"Gotta give Sparky some credit for their free bumper stickers, \""Stop staring at my cones\"" Well I didn't get a cone, but I still tried a cup of ice cream. I guess I thought since it said Gourmet, I didn't realize that the place is really just a Stone-Cold with a bit fancier ice cream. I sampled Brown Sugar Maple Bacon, but didn't taste much and German Choc. cake was only Ok. Finally settled on a pretty decent scoop of cinnamon ice fream with two mixin's ($5...one was free and the other cost me an extra $1 because I donated for holidays). The chocolate chips and chopped pecans made this a tasty treat, but the best ice cream on the planet usually does not include mixing stuff into the treat. It's just a preference, but yogurt gets the toppings, but ice cream should be ready to go from the bins."
2,"Good veggie option- except that they served me the soup with chicken so I had to send it back. Perhaps they thought that chicken must be vegetarian.. :)\nOtherwise the place had a little annoying smell - I'm very sensitive to smell - nobody else seems to have noticed it. Friend enjoyed their meals- no complaints, no big wows."
3,"Like all all you can eat places, don't expect the best quality food. I mean, you get what you pay for right???\n\nI think this place is great - it is opened actually, not sure why it says this place is closed. The restaurant looks trendy inside and its actually kid friendly! The food is decent and the service is good."
0,"Garbage.\n\nThis is your typical AZ, Korean owned/run, sushi + \""Asian fusion\"", quantity over quality sushi joint. Don't let the Korean comment sour you. There are a few very good Korean sushi places here in AZ, but they're few and far between. If you don't know the difference between a Korean sushi place and a Japanese sushi place, simply add 3 stars to my rating and stop reading now.\n\nFor most people, this place will be just fine, but if you are a big sushi fan and have a lot of experience eating sushi, you will be disappointed.\n\nThe good:\n- Water\n\nThe Bad:\n- Green Muscles were mushy in the center and, frankly, tasted bad and old.\n- Fresh chopped wasabi was not good. How this is possible, I have no idea.\n- PONZU SAUCE ON EVERYTHING!! WTF? I want to taste the damn rice, how in the hell can I taste the rice if it's drowning in Ponzu sauce? EPIC FAIL.\n- Fish pieces on Nigiri and Sashimi were WAY too big and too thick and threw the ratio off.\n\nI left about 15 pieces of sushi on the table. This is the first time something like this has ever happened. Again, if your idea of good sushi is an evening of \""Uber AZ Rolls\"" or any roll with ingredients more than rice, seaweed, single fish, go here, eat, have fun. If you refuse to soil soy sauce with wassabi and dip your nigiri upside down in the soy sauce, avoid this place like the plague."
2,After a weekend of St. Patrick's Day fare - decided that we wanted to go to Garduno's for their brunch.  We get to the restaurant and it's a totally different name.  What is this?  Shrimps?  Fish?  :)  We walked in half expecting EVERYTHING to be different.  It wasn't.  Everything is the same.  The brunch is still offered.  The only thing that's changed is the name.  It's been at least two months according to the hostess.  The menu according to her has changed just a little bit.  Today's visit didn't allow for us to review what possibly could have changed.  We were there for brunch.  \n\nFor the most part service is still there.  I think wait staff tends to let us do our thing because it is brunch.  Never an empty water glass.  Refill on chips came right away.  Our waitress even offered to stay with an infant while the g-ma went up and got a plate.
0,"There are a few issues with this place.\nThe obvious is the entirely unacceptable wait for food. I ordered on GrubHub (which I do often) at 2:18pm, my estimated delivery was 3:45pm-3:55pm\nSeemed a little long but its BBQ and red velvet cake with corn bread and mac n cheese so has to be worth some wait, and I am near a college campus so OK.\n\n4:00pm rolls by and I call the restaurant. At first it goes directly to VM. OK, this isn't good so I call again and I get put on hold. Once the gentlemen finally picks up Im told it will be 15-20 minutes for my order and he apologizes for the delay. OK no problem.\n\nI decide to hop on Yelp and look at the reviews, as when I ordered I was starving so just picked a place (I'm still starving as I write this first part). I see the wait is not uncommon. In fact its the norm.\n\n4:20pm rolls by and I message GrubHub. Within 2 minutes I had a text and email stating I should have my food by 4:32pm ...its 4:29pm as I type this. They gave me an extra 10.00 in food, which I appreciate and realize its not their fault my food is late but with all these issues piling up you would think they might get the hint to discontinue business with this place. (Just sayin).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo food got here at: 4:37\n\n\nReview of food:\n\nHot Links - Sauce was spicy and good so was the hotlink the bun was crunchy on the edges link it was over microwaved.\n\nMac N Cheese - Bland. Its a shame too there is so much you can do with Mac N Cheese.\n\nCornbread Muffin - Decent taste, horrible consistency. I don't expect my Cornbread to be chewy.\n\nRed Velvet Cake - Cake was moist and it was good but it had an after taste like the cream cheese had been wrapped in plastic wrap too long\n\n\nAll in all I wont order here again, the food was not great and the time it took to get here was utterly poor."
1,"I LOVE RH, as in LOVE. I was extremely excited to visit this location but unfortunately, my excitement quickly disappeared when I experienced the customer service. I asked for pricing on an outdoor model ( I had to wait 20 minutes to be helped), my question was answered quickly, when I proceeded to ask for pricing on three other pieces ( I knew were they were in the store and their characteristics), I was asked if I could be sent an email with the information.\n\nThe representative looked as if he was in a hurry and I was so disgusted with the way he replied and the lack of interest he had in me as a customer I just wanted to leave. I gave him my information, cell phone, and email, he said he would send it later that day.... I has been a week. \n\nI was planning on purchasing the pieces that day once I knew the final price but the representative assumed that after having waited so long to be helped, I could wait even longer for a reply.\n\nRH... your prices are not a crate and barrel or pottery barn or ikea for that matter.  I have gone to ikea to buy a 20 dollar lamp and have been treated 100 times better than when I wanted to buy a 3500 usd couch at your store.\n\nRH strives to continue to be a luxury brand and your design and quality is superb. Please, have your customer service be up to par with what you are selling."
0,$6.99 steak & Eggs graveyard special. I Know why it's that price. worst steak ever . had 2 bites and my jaw was sore from chewing. eggs were OK.  Bread choices were limited to white or wheat. spend a few bucks more and go elsewhere . but Idid love watching  the drunk wasteoides from drai's eating there at 5 am
3,"Just a mini Update this time as Jackie R. & Mike C. joined me for lunch here today.  The only changes to report from last time was that they have a new Mongolian BBQ chef, but he cooked up my plate of good stuff just fine.  (I like how they cut up the 3 meats like french fries...  works well.)  Another nice touch was chives right there by the delicious Sweet & Sour and Won Ton soups to add in.\n\nOne gripe to \""air.\""  (Pun\u00bf)  They aren't offering paper towels in the bathrooms but only those nasty blowers.  I stood there for a while with it blowing cold air on my hands and then finally wiped them on my shirt.  THEN, how was I supposed to get out of the second door, back into the dining room, without getting more germs on them than ever from pulling the handle open?  Shirt?  Fine... now it's wet, pulled out & wrinkled!\n\nMinus 1 Star from an otherwise excellent lunch buffet offering up 120 tasty items today, plus sauces and dressings.     :-)\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet now $9.39/$8.46 Sr."
4,"Oh my!!!!!\nWe just learned recently, The Beaver Choice does catering as well.  We took a \""small\"" Sandwich Cake\""...IT WAS HUGE and a HUGE hit at the Christmas Party we went to last evening.  Everyone was in awe of it.  How do I describe such a thing.  Let me try.  Lots of delicious sandwich spreads,,,really more like salads...you know egg, tuna or crab salad.  They even make them with ham or roast beef too.  \n\nOurs had tuna and egg salad nestled between cake layers of bread,  Then to top it off...a light spread of mayonnaise as frosting and then it was topped with shrimp, dill sprigs and some luscious caviar as well.\n\nWe talked to Hannah a few days in advance of our party and she handled everything.  The \""cake\"" was ready when we arrived shortly after 5p yesterday and was kept cool in their refrigerator case.  It was stunningly beautiful and I regret only that I forgot to get a picture of it.\n\nThe cake is beautiful to look at and people at the party certainly ate first with their eyes and then of course, they devoured it quickly.\n\nJust a note.  A sandwich cake is not finger food and will require a plate and fork.  But oh, so delicious.  It was a creative and unique culinary highlight to the evening.\n\nThanks so much for your work on this.  It made the party so much more festive.  Way to go!"
2,Food is good but not out of this world. The cook could learn to be more kind to the customers.
2,"This restaurant location used to be El Mas Sabroso. Sadly, El Mas Sabroso is permanently closed. This is the new Mexican joint there now.  They cleaned it up a bit and redecorated/remodeled. Kinda like Filiberto's, but nicer and more modern inside. I think they were going for the Chipotle's look. Their food is good and the pricing is about the same. Carnitas was really dry which is odd. Rice is outstanding.\n\nLike Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless."
2,"*yay!* this is my 200th review!!!!\n\nOk, so I wanted to do something special for my 200th review, so I took myself to LoLo's chicken and waffles for lunch today.  I had really high expectations, but left kind of feeling a little let down.  \n\nI got there, and sitting outside the front door was some girl who I guess was the hostess.  She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.  \n\nSo, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?  It had to have been.  It feels like theres a zillon different little rooms with tables.  \n\nAnyways, so I finally got sat at a real table.  Mazel Tov.   A girl took my drink order, but the service was slow to order. I waited and waited and finally a server came and took my order. I went for the 2 chicken legs and a waffle.  Service actually kinda sucked, but I'm willing to let it go.  I won't hold it against them since everyone seems to like it so much.\n\nSo, they bring out my food.  I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.  It came with a nice amount of butter, which I smeared all over the waffle, and then drowned it in syrup. I liked it!  Thier butter really made a difference.\n\nWhile I was eating, I was happy to see 2 autographs of the Harlem Globetrotters players on the wall, both of which I obviously know.  Impressive!\n\nNeedless to say, I guess I was expecting more.  Service was spotty, unimpressive, and actually kind of sucked.  Food was decent, but not earth shattering.  I will probably return, but probably not for some time."
0,"i saw 4 1/2 stars on this restaurant  so instead of going to my neighbor hood sushi restaurant  with yaki soba on my mind i decided to try this place i showed up at 1130 a m  i was the only person there, when i walked in the owner handed me a menu i went to a table and had a seat i went over the menu 3 or 4 times he sorta asked me if i was ready to order from behind the front desk i guess he did not wat to walk to my table to take my order  i asked him if he had yaki soba  he said no and left it at that so i ordered the lunch special w/chicken katsu the piece of chicken was maybe 3 oz piece 5/6 tempura battered vege a shrimp and a pot sticker and a small salad  6.50  he brought it to my table and left and returned to the back of the restaurant when i finished i went to the front desk he seamed ancious to cash me out but i ordered a side of pot stickers he brought those out and set them on the table ,as my glass of water was empty he never offered to re fill it  it is now noon and the place is still empty NOT A SOUL hmmmm I finished the pot stickers which were weak at best went and paid a rediculous 12.00$ oh all right 11 and change  never the less i left no tip.....you think  boy is this person really in the restaurant business?????????????????????"
2,"I came here on my own the other day and was seated very quickly on one of the benches that are perfect for dining on your own or if you prefer not to wait and have 1-2 people with you.  \n\nI decided to go with the shrimp and pork wonton soup - which is actually soup as opposed to the other \""soup\"" options which specify \""steamed\"".  And also ordered the hot spicy wonton noodles under the \""dry noodles\"" section of the menu.  \n\nOn retrospect I should have ordered one or the other because it was wonton overload and generally food overload, I barely made a dent in either and had plenty to take home.  That being said, I enjoyed the soup and was able to eat about 2 of the wontons.  I was imagining a small bowl of soup but this could dish feed a family of 4 or more!\n\nI wasn't in to the hot wonton noodle dish.  I got the wide flat noodles (as opposed to the thin rice noodles) so not sure if that made a huge difference because it was the flavor that didn't make me swoon.  You can definitely physically feel the heat of the dish but I didn't think there was much flavor.  I was sweating and my mouth was reacting to the spice but it was spicy hot as opposed to spicy flavorful.  Perhaps the name of the dish makes sense then.\n\nI would be curious to go back and try something else."
4,"Love whole foods! The store has a great selection of fresh, healthy food. I always go in to get a kale salad. This store offers several different ready to go food departments that make it convenient for grabbing lunch, dinner or a snack. I recommend that everyone try whole foods. Don't let the prices scare you, you're paying for quality and its your body that you're fueling. Why not eat good and fresh!"
0,"Every time I go there is empty shelves throughout the entire food section no matter when I go... have talked to managers so much about this they know me by name now, still not stocked as any busy store should be..."
0,"Worse show I have ever seen. The fact she was lip syncing was absolutely disappointing. There was a huge crowd and good vibe but the show overall was bad. My wife and I left and gave our tickets to a couple in the last row. Britney danced as if she was hurt....wait, did I write dance? more like she walked around while her dancers did all the dancing. So, no singing, no dancing, bad outfits well...it sucked.\nSorry Britney. I thought I was a fan till I saw you live. One more, thing please ask Planet Hollywood to upgrade your sound system. Not the worse thing you have done in Las Vegas but a close second."
0,"Worst floral experience ever. I ordered through FTD. Thank goodness I chose to have them deliver it to me and then I would deliver it to my mother because what I received was the worst arrangement I've ever seen. I couldn't possibly give it to my mother for Mother's Day. Different vase, old flowers - just awful. FTD called the shop to try to mediate the situation and the shop was completely rude and adamant that they did nothing wrong and refused to do anything for me (return or replace). FTD finally gave me my money back. I will NEVER order from them ever and will tell everybody I know (including you Yelpers) to never go to them. There are so many other great floral shops in town."
3,Go yard or go home! The strawberry and mango flavor is refreshing. I usually like pina coladas but the miami vice didn't have the same kick of the strawberry and mango. If you could put fun in a bottle...it would come in a yard size.
4,"Back to wearing glasses after 11 years and all I have to say is \""Thank You\"" to Central Phoenix Eye Care. You made the experience the best possible. And Dr. Stephanie Mastores is incredible. I can see clearly now and am looking fashionable as well. This is the only optometrist I will ever recommend. Thanks again and Go Buckeyes!!"
1,Pretty confusing AIrport.   I still like SFO the most.
1,"If your namesake is wings, they should be awesome. And at BWW, the wings are merely mediocre. They do offer a wide range of sauces but nothing stood has stood out so far in my experience. They offer all-you-can-eat wings on Thursdays during lunch but their idea is to wait the customer out - we were there for 75 minutes with a very light crowd and we only got to re-fill our baskets (4 wings at a time) three times. That's barely passable service.\n\nIn terms of their drinking selection, BWW is really missing the mark. They understandably are catering to the sports fan crowd but to make it synonymous with only mass produced beer is terrible. There are so many craft options they could incorporate, especially local in Phoenix, and they really could do better if they aspire to be a go-to bar.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with BWW, there are just so many other good options, especially for their price point."
3,"This... Was an interesting forced upon find... Like... They found me. Literally.\n\nI was minding my own business at work when an email came through from the big bosses that this food truck would be in the parking lot. Apparently they'd demanded their presence. And then every employee in my call center, including my boss, began chattering all excitedly like Gollum to his precious about the noms to be found inside this obnoxious colored food truck,.\n\nI was intrigued.\n\nI was even more intrigued and skeptical when I learned this was a truck that only served grilled cheese.\n\nAnd then I learned more... Like... They're not your average cheese and soggy bread sammiches!\n\nI ordered, at my boss' behest, the Cheesey Mac N' Rib with BBQ pork and tots.\n\nThis should be illegal. It's to die for, and their bacon mayo:? Equally heinous and just... wrong. Food truck food should NOT taste this good. Ever. My skepticism was shattered.\n\nOnly complaint? It took 20 minutes for my order to be up. My break is an hour long... That was precious facebook time wasted so I'll remove a star, but other than that? Holy God. Please come back!"
1,"Despite its friendliness and cleanness, Pho Hung failed in the food category.  My Pho was lukewarm at best.  My fiance's shaken beef was small in portion and quality of beef subpar.  My mom's seafood pho was salty and, again, lukewarm.  C'mon, pipping hot broth is a MUST for Pho or else it wouldn't cook the bean sprouts, let alone the rare beef!!!\n\nI hadn't had Pho for more than 2 months.  Pho Hung failed to revive my love for Pho.  I think I'll skip Pho all together when I am in Vegas from now on."
3,"Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las Vegas and far, far away from any parking, the Auld Dubliner is still one of the best Irish pubs in town.  Pretty much because the bar understands that a pub should be low key and classic.  In Ireland, a pub is just a run of the mill watering hole.  But by the time they migrate over to the states, many of them become extravagant or showy places in an attempt to seem more European.  \n\nNot the Auld Dubliner.  The place is classic.  While the establishment is fairly new, it feels like a place where the wood on the bar has been worn down from a hundred years of spilled beer.  The bar's selection of Irish whiskeys is solid.  Not the widest selection in town, but a long enough collection that it will take you awhile to drink through the menu.  On top of that, the place has a superb beer selection.  One of my favorite Irish beers (Kilkenny) is almost impossible to find in the western U.S. and they have it on tap.  If for no other reason, the bar is praiseworthy for its well chosen stock of spirits and beer.   \n\nBut they also serve up a solid pub menu.  When we went, we had deep fried chips with curry (yum) and a couple of solid cheese burgers topped with Irish cheddar cheese.  The night we were there they had a solo guitar act playing and he did a pretty solid job with a library of Irish rock and soul ballads.\n\nI hope that Lake Las Vegas figures out how to survive because the Auld Dubliner is a fine place to bring a group for drinks."
2,"We ate at the breakfast buffet a few times recently and found it  had been downsized since our last visit though the quality remains high.  We started off with some almost ripe melon and strawberry yogurt along with OJ.  I tried a piece of bone-in ham (fair), a small slice of cheese quesadilla (excellent), crispy bacon (wonderful), apple crepe (so good) and a spoonful of warm bread pudding with pecan sauce (excellent).  We used a 2/1 coupon from a coupon book mailed to locals and received an additional $1 off by showing a slot card."
4,"We really enjoy this place and it is a nice change from so many of the other LV Strip Bars.  First, the music is played at a level that allows you to talk to everyone in your party.  The bar itself just reeks class and the views are fantastic.  The only negative is the high price of the drinks, but to get the ambiance and view I don't mind paying a little extra.   The service was really good too.  The only negative was the Chimay was served way too cold."
3,"GREAT burgers! Good service. And it doesn't break the bank! A solid 4 stars all around. \n\nI'm usually skeptical of gourmet burger joints just bc there are sooooo many out there now. A burger is a burger right? Well no not really. And BurGR proves that you can still make a piece of meat between two pieces of bread pretty unique. \n\nHubby and I tried the place out on a Thursday night about 6pm. We stayed at planet hollywood and every time we go by BurGR There always seems to be a line. But we were told 25 min and it really took us maybe 15 min in line. You can get in faster if you opt for one of the high top tables which are teeny but it'll do. Good view of the TV to catch some of the games.  I got the chanterelle burger which doesn't come with cheese but you can add on. I opted for Fontina cheese which worked great with the arugula, mushrooms and fig jam. My hubby got the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Wow. I mean. There are no words for that burger. Except maybe crazy delicious. What I like about the burgers are that they're not huge and unmanageable to eat. They fit nicely in the hands and are the perfect portion at least for us. \n\nThe truffle Parmesan fries. Very good. Not too truffle-y. We also had the jalepeno poppers which were delicious!! The floor mgr came to check on us and gave us a funny tidbit, that in each batch of poppers there's one where they leave the seeds. apparently  my hubby got that one bc he bit into it and felt like his face was on fire. But the poppers. I highly recommend them. They have bacon inside them, hello!!\n\nTo finish off our dinner we got the sticky toffee push pops which were delicious and just the right touch of sweetness to end your meal. Good beer on tap too. A nice solid place to grab a tasty meal and not go broke!! Good service too."
4,Love it! The older gent that runs the counter talks like some kind of cartoon character.  He is so sweet and welcoming.  Great food too! I will continue to make this a go to place for Japanese food.  Delicious!
3,"Before I moved to the far east side of Madison, The Egg & I was my go to weekend morning breakfast joint. \nI would sure like to know what brand of coffee they are serving, because it is absolutely delicious! \nThey have ample serving sizes and tons of seating! Huge parking area!\n\nWhat I enjoy most about this restaurant is the fact that they are only open for breakfast and lunch. The quality of their food shows that they can put more effort into making a great breakfast vs. planning for the dinner menu later in the day. What a great concept!\n\nIf I had to suggest ordering one thing, it would be the green chili (as a side for dipping and spreading on eggs and potatoes). It's pretty fantastic! \n\nI also enjoy the fact that they have so many choices for other side orders and bread choices. Sour dough! My favorite!\n\nAs for the lunch menu, they have burgers, salads, and sandwiches. nothing too specials. Just great prices quality food. \n\nHonestly, I wish that they would expand and make a new Egg & I on the east side of Madison. You would find me eating there at least once a month."
3,What made me get a high rating was the oxtail soup! Sooooooooooooo good. That is a must try. And also those huge ass hot dogs. Do the chili cheese way. One more thing is the steak and eggs for $6.99 is amazingly delicious.\n\nThe only bad thing is that the workers are kinda rude but food makes up for it.
3,This Loblaws is good. Avoid peek times because the queues become unbearable.
1,"It pains me to write this review--I want so badly to like the Astor House--I love the Tuck Shop and never have had a bad meal there.\n\nbut things are just not right at the Astor House--we ate there last night on Halloween.  What a missed marketing opportunity--Trick and Treaters kept stopping by --we heard many saying we had no idea this place was here.  instead of handing out a coupon for a macaroon with lunch--the staff did nothing and were actually kind of funky when people walked in.  \n\nThe Astor House needs to get an identity--the \""service\"" is just funky--neither a cafeteria nor service--you would think with 4 people in the restaurant--you would not have to go to the end of the counter and pick up your \""tray\"" of food.  the tables are wobbly and the chairs are uncomfortable--things that I wouldn't care about if the food was good.\n\nOn to the food--I may have a bias because I spent a lot of time in Kansas City and know what good barbecue is--what is being served is not.  the meat continues to be dry and the sauces are yucky--they are two sweet or weirdly spiced.--the one highlight was the link--chicken and garlic was good.  The food is served in paper on trays--all i can say is yuck!--we had to ask for paper plates--which at least made the eating process tolerable..\n\nthe Astor House is in a great neighborhood--but even the neighbors who can walk there are either going to go to the Tuck Shop or walk a few more blocks to 7th st to restaurants that have much better food.\n\nI will definitely be back to the Tuck Shop over and over again, but am done with the Astor House--have been there several times--and it is just not right--they need to find out what the neighbors want and be that--coffee, sandwich, drinks and snacks--do --something well and be at the level of the Tuck Shop instead of a pretend cafeteria--\n."
0,"If you value life...never NEVER eat at buffet Fu Lam. I am appalled at what is served at buffet Fu Lam. The items served at buffet Fu Lam barley passes for \""Americanized\"" Chinese food. Nothing seems fresh at Fu Lam. Please avoid eating here, eat somewhere else even McDonald's will do."
1,"I love the concept, but this place is so frustrating! Hire a freaking hostess! Above all get bartenders who can MOVE! Get ready to wait an hour for a bartender to look and you and ignore you some more. The extra back bar doesn't have that much so they're no help. Get bartenders who effing move it and problem solved. Heck have shot girls/guys walking around or something! I'm at a bar! I'm social awkward! Give me booze fast!!!"
2,"Much better than the last time we saw him at the Riviera.  He is at Hard Rock now, my cousin wanted to see him so we all got drug there.\n\nHe is really rough with language and comments about sex were stomach turning, just really nasty so it was a turn off.  However, he is an icon because he was famous.  He WAS.  Not anymore and probably for this reason.\n\nWhen we went to the Riviera the bar prices were half of what we paid here, 12 bucks for drinks?  Ridiculously priced.\n\nOur group agreed that Vinnie Favorito was a better show but also had ridiculous bar prices."
1,"Salads, soups, sandwiches, and cookies with a nice assembly-line-type set-up.  You do get a cookie with each meal, it's large and it's clean.  They have breakfast in the morning.\n\nThis just isn't my favorite place to eat - nothing is terrible, but the ingredients are pretty blah and the resulting meals are, as well.  On top of all that, they're not at all inexpensive for what you get, and the service is as bland as the food.  \n\nI only eat here when there are no other options."
2,"Like Tortilla Fish.  Very simple menu,  fish tacos (steamed or fried), shrimp tacos (fried only), a few salads and quesadillas, that's all.  No rice or beans. But good quality, friendly service, and quick turnaround.  Nice salsa bar which has different topping for your tacos,  that includes a coleslaw like topping, a few different types of salsa, jalapenos and a chipotle mayo and avocado topping,  plus a few other ones.  Had one taco that had shredded steamed fish that was much better than I expected (not fishy, and the perfect amount of spices,  and another one that had fried fish, fried shrimp and and fried pepper stuffed with cheese.  Ingredients of good quality and freshness that I really enjoyed.  Sometimes I don't feel well after eating fried foods, but this one wasn't too greasy,  and felt just fine afterwords.   \n\nI did try the fried fish and french fries,  which was too doughy and not enough fish, just the smaller pieces that you'd get in the tacos.   That I would not recommend.\n\nDining area and restrooms were very neat, and clean, and people there are also super friendly.\n\nGood value.."
1,"Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better. \n\nRamen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no. \n\nBroth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something. \n\nBroth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.\n\nChashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs. \n\nTamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.\n\nAlcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)\n\nService: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem \n \nParking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus. \n\nWait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there. I was seated quickly"
1,Strange. I posted before about great blue berry cakes. Today 3 pancakes and maybe 10 blueberries in all. Sad.  I will try again but I will be cautious and reiterate what I want. Friendly  service but forgot lots of requests
3,"I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm going with 4 stars because *I* had a great time, even though some of my friends didn't have such a great experience.  Additionally, I visited Commonwealth on the night of First Friday, so I think things might be different at other times/days. \n\nTo the review! \nIf you're going to visit Commonwealth on a busy night (holiday weekend, First Friday, etc), get there early!! We arrived around 10p, and while there was a line to get in, it wasn't too long, maybe 5-10 minutes.  It was busy, but not overly crowded.  The space, as others have mentioned, is beautiful. Just a gorgeous bar.  We didn't get anything fancy as far as drinks go (sadly), but what we did get was fine. Slightly overpriced for downtown.  \n\nHeading upstairs- I thought this was just as cool. A rooftop lounge/bar/dance floor. I felt like I was in another city! There was table service, and they were letting people sit at the unsold areas until they were purchased.  The DJ was fantastic, people were dancing, and it was just lots of fun.  Unfortunately, as the night went on, things started to go downhill.  By 11, the line outside was getting crazy long, and we stupidly went downstairs. We had quite a long wait to get back upstairs because they were full to capacity, unless you had a wristband (?) or had a table. We luckily made it back up when a large party left, but some of our other friends weren't so lucky. Downstairs was pretty unbearable by midnight- I don't know how people ever got a drink because it was so crowded.  Even upstairs, it took forever.  \n\nI'll be back, but definitely would advise to make this an early stop on your Downtown adventures, or to go during the week (and not on First Friday!)"
4,"This place is so good.  The food is wonderful, the employees all know me by name, the atmosphere is laid back.  I love to go for breakfast, where my grandson and I can enjoy the geese and the other wildlife on the lake, the atmosphere is very peaceful, allowing for a great place to take a bunch of friends and actually be able to hear each while we enjoy great meals, and their specials are always tasty.  My only dislike ever, was their pasta, and that's a personal sauce preference."
4,"I have been here 4 times. It is on top of my list of restaurants to visit whenever I visit Vegas. There is always a line, so expect to wait, but it is completely worth it! The service is great. They have a super friendly waitstaff who are really knowledgable about their menu and drinks. Every time I've been, I've only gotten breakfast, so I have no idea how their lunch or dinner is. Their food has huge portions, but every bite is delicious. I've had their pancakes, chicken and waffles, hash, eggs Benedict, and sampled many other dishes that the people I came with ordered. Everything was delicious. If you've never been, this is definitely one of the places you need to go! You won't regret it!"
3,Great food and wonderful service. Here during breakfast hour. I will be back.
4,"We went out of our way to visit Fuego Tacos, since I bought a deal off of Groupon, and we were blown away. If you want to compare the pricing to Filiberto's or any of the low end restaurants, the price will disappoint you, but in comparison to other restaurants of it's ranks, the price is more than adequate! The complimentary chips come with an amazing salsa. The service was quick and our server was amiable. It is a very cute and intimate atmosphere, and I definitely loved that they had extra seating on their second floor. I loved the charcoal grilled taste of my carne asada burrito! It is definitely a place to visit if you find yourself near the Esplanade Theater."
0,"Very bad experience at BLD this morning.  On our last vist the waitress forgot to place our order, after 30 minutes we left.  Today the service very poor and slow.  The wait staff just doesn't care about customer service.  Stopped woman manager and told her we had been waiting 35 minutes for our food.  No apologies, she brought our food and never stopped by our table thru the meal to see if everything was okay.  Too loud and too much of a bar atmophere for breakfast.  Never again and I live just down the street."
4,"For my Very First Review, I wanted to do a no brain-er. \n\nThis is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to. If you Love beef, you will love this place. At about $50 per person it is pricey but the beef has awesome flavor and it's all you can eat so get your grub on. \n\nIf you Vegetarian, you can get just the salad bar and it is still incredible. I can't give this place enough stars since it is the only restaurant that easily pleases both Carnivores and vegetarians! \n\nI've been to this location several times and each time the food has been amazing. The truly greatest thing about this place is the consistency. Each time we have gone the service, food and experience has been the same. Amazing. \n\nMy personal Favorite is the House special. It has great flavor and is mouthwatering. The lamb is also great. each cut is great in it's own unique way. If you like well done or rare, ask the server and they will ensure you get it. Believe me you won't regret trying this place."
2,"Being a lazy bum who doesn't want to wash his own truck, and having sworn off Danny's and their army of overly aggressive windshield replacement sales goobs, I took the advice of some Tweeters and rolled into Los Olivos. \n\nThe $15 wash was more than adequate but the real experience value came from what Los Olivos didn't do: They didn't try to upsell me and nobody messed with my seats. Seriously, don't touch the seats. \n\nI would recommend Los Olivos because my vehicle was clean, the people were nice, and they aren't associated with Danny's Carousel in any way. And that's enough."
0,"Its true what they say, \""you get for what you pay for\"".  From the start of our visit, the room was dirty.  The bathroom was obviously used, bed was undone, there was beer cans in the trash, and the sink was filled with dirty water! Really!!!  I call room service which took them a good 20 minutes to get here, not to mention the other 10 to 15 minutes it took the maid to clean it.  On top of all of this, the ice machine was broken, the TV remote did not work, and there was no mini fridge.  I digress, really!!  Its true that its the cheapest of the bunch, but come on, really?!!  I caution everyone before they book a room here.  It would of been nice if they comp the room for us or at least give us another room.  Oh by the way, i'm still waiting for the engineers to come to my room and fix the TV/remote control.  Been waiting 20 minutes now.  Only nice thing about this place, is that its right next to the monoreal which drops you of on the strip."
4,"Perfect lunch place!  The food was fresh and tasted great!! If they have the bread pudding on the menu, it's a must have...and I don't usually like it."
4,amazing! need i say more!?
4,"Better than Wynn. We were here for a Sunday brunch ($27/person). Fantastic value for wonderful variety of good quality food. Some of the standouts were thai flavored edamame, Korean spear ribs (galbi), gnocchi, mac & cheese, shrimp rolls... Very good value for the money & I would return here in a heart beat. We went to the Wynn buffet two days later & honestly, variety & taste of the food were below those of wicked spoon."
1,"Review UPDATE!!!! \n\nAfter reading my own review I checked GroupOn for deals and I just had to eat here again! \n\nYes, the food is good but the management staff are lacking in foresight and intelligence. I bought a GroupOn Now for this restaurant that's main fare is ALL YOU CAN EAT. Guess what? They refused to accept it! What? $20 for $12 on a $80+ bill? \n\nWe sit down, order our first $12.50 drink, and say all you can eat, oh and, we have a GroupOn. They say \""That is not valid for ALL YOU CAN EAT\"". I say, check the GroupOn fine print, there are no specifications! I spent $135 in this restaurant last time I was here. It's only $8 off! \n\nThey refuse!\n\nI pay off the drink and walk out. I eat out nearly everyday, and I will not be going back. Perhaps the manager needs some management skills. They would have easily made $500 off me this year. It's not like they didn't need the customers, we were the only table seated as the only other patrons walked out moments after we walked in. \n\n~~~ Previous review. \n\nYou can get nearly any kind of awesome seafood or meat all unlimited for like $25! Oh Gosh! I love it. They actually comped a drink for me because they were out of what I wanted! Now that's great service. \n\nThe only thing they could do is have charcoal grills, they really intensify the flavor and make the meat so much better. That and temperature control (the AC was blasting so much I had to bring in my blanket from the car) are the only reasons I'm not giving them five stars."
3,"A group of 7 of us dined at Bottega on a Saturday night. \n\nOur table wasn't ready when we arrived, so we waited at the bar. As an apology for the wait, we were each given a complimentary glass of wine. A+ on the customer service!\n\nAs an entree, we had calamari, served with lemon.  They were perfectly cooked - the texture was great, but the oil used tasted very mildly burnt. \n\nThe star is the pizza! The margherita and capricciosa were delicious! The crust is thin, crispy on the outside and chewy in the center - amazing. The sauce is simple and clean, and has a rich tomato flavour.  And the cheese .. mmm."
3,Out of Business!
4,Mike is the most honest mechanic in town.  I can always count on them to take the time needed to diagnose any problem my cars have.  After going through multiple mechanics I can honestly say there is no need to look elsewhere.
1,"Was so excited to have a yogis close to home. Love the food! Hard for me to find decent Japanese food but this is yummy (for being fast food). Been here 4 times. Terrible customer service. I guess being welcoming is not a high priority. Also, this location will not let you use yogis gift certificates. They say because they are a franchise. Hmmm...."
1,The salsa and the fact it's a neat old building (on the outside) is the only reason it gets 2 stars. Tamales' were drenched in a red sauce and tortilla soup was luke warm and mediocre at best. Chips were cold and hard not warm and crispy. Overpriced for the quality of meal. Real disappointment when there's better Mexican food in Indianapolis!
4,"I love both locations equally. Such a delicious cafe caramel. I also really love their tea selections. The baristas are always friendly, and there's always a place to sit. What more can you ask for? :)"
0,"My family and I ate lunch here for the first and last time. The beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup. The burros were alright but I've had much better. I hope that the AC was broken and that it's not always that hot inside. The service was pretty bad to, really slow. I'm giving them one star because the rice was good. I'd say find someplace else to eat."
0,"Totally gone down the tube. Way overpriced for food out of a box. Deserts are dry, old and inedible. Meat is like boot leather. The oysters stunk of dead fish. Plus just like the Paradise Buffet at Freemont, they were stuck to the shell. Very old.\n   Wait staff was as rude as they come. Wanted a 20% gratuity for my party of 8. This is a BUFFET dang it. WE get our OWN FOOD. Then they seated us 4 to a table across the room from each other. The buffet had 15 people in it. They did this out of spite. Stay away."
0,"No. Just, no. I can't speak for the quality of the teacher because I couldn't hear how she interacted with my 2.5 year old. WHY couldn't I hear her you ask? Because I was behind glass AWAY from her when she hadn't ever had a swim lesson before! I didn't even get to take her in and meet the teacher. The teacher knew NOTHING about her but her name and I didn't even get to tell her about her anxiety. She had her doing things she had never heard of and she was terrified."
3,"Very clean and modern, safe area.  Pleasant front desk staff, called me after check-in to make sure all was ok.  Detached sitting area, fridge, spacious, big TV.\nNegatives:  Strange thermostat, hard to figure out, and the usual lame Arabica Hyatt in room coffee.\nNot on older car GPS software, as it is a newer hotel, so beware if you are driving and have an older car, can be tricky to get to unless you know where you are going.\nWhen I woke at 7AM on a Sunday it was very quiet and I was surprized at how peaceful it was, unlike weekend Embassy Suites, but then very shortly thereafter I heard kids running up and down the hall and mirthfully screaming in Spanish.  There was a congregation of seven people loudly chatting, also in Spanish,  in the hall who seemed to deliberately get even louder when I stuck my head out to see what the commotion was about.  I suppose I cannot blame the hotel for the rudeness of its family-oriented clientele, however, as this is a universal problem in cheaper hotels with large rooms and extra sleeping areas.  Perhaps a check-in written discrete request to guests asking them to respect quiet hours would be in order? ( I know, wishful thinking)."
3,"I came here for a friends benefit for his son.  No more details need to be explained but it was for a great cause.  This place opened its doors, offered its people and singers/bands performed.  For the cause, I am glad I came and saw this place.  I have never been to the arts district for a nighttime experience/bars!  \n\nIt was hard to find because the link to the yelp map does take you to the wrong location.  Once getting to the right location it is pretty much on the down low the lighting in the sign only light half of the sign and there are no signs around the door.  Little shady looking, but after walking in wow.  Nicely decorated in hip decor lighting is awesome for the nighttime experience and the staff is nice.  \n\nPrices are middle ground and the acoustics are good even though we were sitting on the other side of the bar from the bands.\n\nDefinitely a do over!"
1,"Oh, Athenian Express. You were so promising, alluring, and tempting when I walked in the door and yet, so disappointing.\n\nThe bad:\n- Awful gyro meat. This tastes like the gyro meat at Crave sandwiches, which we all know isn't real gyro meat. \n- THREE slices of gyro meat. THREE. I took a picture to prove that it literally only came with three slices. Whichever reviewer said that their sandwiches were bigger than a Kronos lied and lied mercilessly. Seriously, who gives three slices of meat?\n- The sauce was mediocre. It's homemade, but that doesn't mean it has to be mediocre. \n- Fries aren't anything special. They taste like fries that come in a bag, no special seasoning or anything. \n- Cubs fans. Enough said. \n\nThe good:\n- I ordered fries, which I got, but they also gave me fruit. I don't know why, but this saved the review from being one star because the fruit salad had mango AND orange in addition to melons and strawberries.\n- Fast service. Damn fast. Maybe too fast since they gave me so little meat.\n\nOverall:\nI was so excited to go here because I only get gyros on a special occasion. Well hot damn, I won't go back. I'm going to stick to George's Famous Gyros on McKellips in Tempe where not only are they not Cubs fans but they use real gyro meat."
4,"Living in Vegas you don't always seem to find the best of the best when it comes to people truly caring about the profession they've chosen.  This is certainly NOT the case when it comes to Willis from Joshua Ian Photography !!  I have used his services twice in the past and not only have I been thrilled with his expertise, but the photos that I received have impressed guests at my home when browsing through the \""family wall of fame !!\"" Willis is spiritually gifted !! It doesn't get any better than that !!  He has a true eye for photography and you will be pleasantly surprised when he can create scenarios for your special event that you've never thought of !!!  Whether it be a wedding, a special birthday, or, in my case, a surprise gift for a very special niece, Willis takes your occasion to a whole new level.  If you are looking for a photographer for ANY special event, look no further.  Willis from Joshua Ian Photography is truly the man for your special day !!!"
4,"Great place to hang out with friends or family. The good is great, the atmosphere is relaxing. The best thing on the menu I think is their Tower Burger. I almost always get it. It literally is a tower! Their pizza is good too and is good even when it's not conventional pizza. \n\nTheir coffee bar is great too. They have some excellent brews too.\n\nI highly recommend L.M.!"
1,"Nice location west of Arcadia. That's about the best I can say. We were a party of 4 for dinner on a Sunday night. Restaurant was about half full. We received water shortly after we sat, then waited 10-15 minutes for a server to come to the table and only after we flagged her down. We were hungry and ordered a bottle of wine, salads and main course all at the same time. It took about 30 minutes to get the wine and 40 minutes for the salads (despite multiple requests for a status on our salads). We asked to speak to a manager, and that took another 10-15 minutes. When he did stop by our table, he asked if he could pour some more wine (no thank you, we were pouring our own and were fine), then he walked away. Completely disinterested. Our main courses came about 10 minutes later. Two of us ordered the flat iron steak - one ordered medium and the other medium well. Both came on the \""well\"" side of medium well. Another in our party had the pork special, which was very good. The chicken ordered by our fourth was unremarkable. If I were rating this solely on service alone, it would barely be one star. The rating at two stars is for a nice location and decent (but unremarkable) food.\nI will not be back."
1,"Yelp  must be broken - this was barely edible. \n\nI can't possibly understand how the average ranking is so high for this place.  Honesly, I over-ordered so that I could get a sampling of a few different things.  Even with that shotgun approach I could not find any of the four dishes that was worth eating even half the portion. \n\nIs this really the best Chinese food in town??  It definitely feels like you are in a restaurant in China when you are at a table but.... not when it comes to the food."
4,Outatanding.   Lump crab cales were all crab.  Loves the oysters.  Had swordfish and tasted Sea Bass and all was perfectly done and presentation wonderful.  Just delicious
4,i love the outlets. It has more shopping selections i love.
0,"CUSTOMER BEWARE, this is a horrible outfit.  We took our car there for a regular wash, they left the windows open thru the wash, and broke the electronic holder completely off on a brand new Lexus, that cost over $100 and denied everything even though we had witnesses and a policemen right there.  Since it is a civil matter, we had to take them to court.  The lesson here is avoid unethical businesses, and that makes reviews like this one so much more usefully.   We ran into a previous customer that says this is normal operating procedure, and that he avoids this place, but comes here only for company car.  Not sure what to think but will NEVER come back under any circumstance.  OTHER CUSTOMER BEWARE."
2,3.5 Stars\n\nThe food was better than okay and had me wanting to come back to explore their menu.  The corn beef hash took a minute but was definitely worth the wait.  \n\nWill definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas.
0,"They've changed the menu to Southwestern and have discontinued the tequila specials. Skip it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTasty Gringo style tacos, and amazing drink specials. This is probably that late night place you're looking for if you grew up in LA or San Diego. They make real guac, serve up hefty margaritas, and it's all at only-in-vegas prices. If you're losing and want to party, definitely come here. This is also a great post-club move if you want some grub. The food is freshly prepared and while nothing amazing, stands up as a decent taco joint. They're pretty damn good here and I've grown up with great tacos in Mexico and Tijuana. \n\nRecommended highly for value. A great place to meet up with friends. Hardly an decor or \""vibe\"", the drinks and food do the talking. Bar/Pour service is outstanding.\n\nAt Bally's at the far end of the casino. Just head for the goal line.\n\nTip: on weekends you can get a 5 shot Cuervo (yes) margarita with a pretty cool souvenir glass...for $15.  Yes, five shots. Careful with that, Amigo!"
3,"I love Angelina's pizza. The pastas are pretty good but the pizza is what really stands out here. The prices are reasonable as well. Only thing I would change is the servers/cashiers. Not too friendly in my opinion and kinda come off as the \""we-don't-really-care\"" type. If it wasn't for the service, Angelina's would definitely got the 5-star treatment from me.  The $8.99 pick up special which includes a 16 inch one topping pizza is my type of deal.  Killer pizza always keeps me coming back!"
4,"I'm practically at this spot everyday. I often wonder why people still drink the burned tar that is Starbucks. I love this location because the staff is amazing- Todd and Kevin are the best (we love Limor on the weekends). I'm so glad to see Caribou offer different tea lattes. Love it. They offer so many more options than just coffee- and the prices are reasonable....and not too mention you're not bombarded by buying knick nacks and CD's. The Mocha Latte is excellent and my husband usually goes for the Mint Condition- they offer 3 different choices of chocolates in your beverage (if it calls for it), which is a nice added option. You can mix up different beverages and flavors and I love the different flavors you can get around the holidays as well. Check it out. Drop Starbucks."
1,"Not bad, but definitely needs improvement for a one Michelin star establishment. I know negative reviews are never popular. However I will make a effort to best explain why.\n\nThis review is based on the 9-course prix-fixe menu (the regular menu items which my wife ordered looked better.) The first two dishes started off well enough. The ingredients of the first one were not to my personal taste, but very well executed. This must be acknowledged. The second, the scallop was quite good. Unfortunately, a too big flake of red pepper interrupted the delicacy of the scallop. After the first two dishes (both with a little bit too much red pepper flake), all I could taste in my mouth was red pepper flake. The tip of my tongue was burning (and I'm someone who can easily handle spicy.) And I thought this was french cuisine, not authentic burn-off-your face thai.\n\nThe smoked salmon in the light curry sauce was over-salted and the combination did not mesh well at all. It was essentially a strange juxtaposition of a piece of lox dumped into an mild asian curry, i.e. what I would call bad-asian fusion. To make the dish work, I had to cut up the small piece of salmon and soak in the sauce. Perhaps a strong sauce would have been in order to offset the saltiness of the fish. Or the fish could have been less salted.\n\nThe major disappointment was the quail. Foie Grae was excellent. However it was wrapped in rather tasteless piece of quail. The sauce on it tasted like something from a typical decent vietnamese/french restaurant located in the middle of a suburb. As THE signature dish, it was unacceptable. I have a good idea of how this should taste like, i.e. explode with flavor. But on this night, it just didn't do it. \n\nMy friend with me, who had been to L'Atelier on many past occasions, had a small bite, and he simply was in such a shock that he forgot to demand that the chefs remake this dish and do it properly on my behalf.\n\nBTW, the executive chef was not present on this night. The chef in charge also did not make a presence in the kitchen (the place has a visible kitchen in front) until our meal was nearly over.\n\nIf I were Mr. Robuchon, I would definitely pay this place a visit to ensure that it continues to reflect well on his good reputation. It's my understanding that he hasn't visited this establishment for quite a while and has been busy opening new L'Ateliers throughout the world. I think it shows.\n\nIn closing: again, the food wasn't bad. It just wasn't one star Michelin."
3,"This was probably the first thoughtful Stations casino designed with an artful eye- showcasing elements not usually found in your typical casino.\nBeautiful spanish/mediterranean tile- I love this the most about this casino. The colors are gorgeous. The restaurants: Hooters- ate here once, the shrimp is delish, Oyster Bar- very good- ate here many many times, the Buffet- just ok for me, Ben & Jerry's- yummy combinations, Fatburger (my favorite fast food burger place). The amenities: Amphitheater- saw an all-star Jazz concert featuring Dav Koz and friends; general admission- had a great time here with my co-workers/friends, Cinemas- watched many movies here, the Lounge- small but fun- saw the Spazmatics here. It's a very good casino in the Henderson area with lots to offer."
1,"Do not move here!!! my wife and i were looking for a nice place to live in vegas and i thought this would be the spot... we rented for a year so we could find the right house to buy... Thank god i am only locked in here for 6 more months... it is a section 8 community, so now i pay full price for my house but all my neighbors do not... Its not fair and i have to listen to them fight all the time about drugs and have seen 2 physical fights as well... Security does nothing but tells you to call Metro... Save your time and money and look somewhere else... The golf course has gone downhill too, they give out 3 months of unlimited golf for $69, so that brought all the right crowds here too... There are plenty more communities that are safer than this and do not have section 8... ( section 8 housing in a gated community is a oxymoron... )"
1,"There were many more positions than personnel to fill them.  We encountered an inexperienced clerk who tried to upsell us on everything imaginable.  If we hadn't been hip to the cons we'd have been totally ripped off by all the extra (unneeded) charges.  And yet, we got ripped off anyway by an outrageous fee imposed by Phoenix to pay for their new rental car palace.  Beware!  Rent off-site if you can."
1,"Met a guy named Kortnei on the strip and he told us the ladies could get in free and the guys would have to pay 20 but, there would be free drinks from 10-1130.  We arrived at 10, and were greeted with VIP passes and the ladies were escorted upstairs.  Myself and 4 other male buddies went down stairs with our VIP passes and were told to stand in the General Admission line.  When we showed our passes they laughed and told us we were in the right line, and we were NOT on the guest list!!  Then, we were told that the entry was $30, and we could not get in for 40-45 minutes.  (After the free drinks).  But, the bouncer offered to get us in with a \""Fast Pass\"" for another $20, so it was $50 per person to get in.  We all left disgusted!  Not for the $50, to get in which we gladly would have paid because we were there to party.  It was just the bait and switch, SHADINESS that went down.  I gave 2 stars becuse the resort is nice and we salvaged our night at the Deuce Lounge."
4,"We expected a long wait after we read the reviews before heading over for breakfast on the 4th of July...great service! And great food. Farmer's omelettes, breakfast burrittos and pancakes. We were are really impressed! We look forward to going again. But, please... Don't let the secret out about this gem! LOL"
4,I have been coming here for years and always share this spot with my closest friend. I usually have the James Bond and the Japanese Lasagna as they are a couple of my favorites. I also have had the rolley rice and ask for extra ponzi sauce...yum yum! The screaming orgasm is wonderful as well as the Something Wrong#7. They don't have an all you can eat here which would just put them over the top on my opinion but may put them out of business. They seem to do quite well and are always very busy during lunch. This will continue to be a spot I come to.
1,"I had intended to visit the French restaurant next door, but it was completely packed on a Friday night so I went up the stairs to this Indian restaurant instead.  Wasn't very busy, but there were two large groups having a good time (both had wine, so they brought their own as this is a BYOB place).  \n\nOrdered the combination dinner with dal soup, the soup was rather bland compared to what I've had elsewhere.  Next were some meat rolls with a small salad, and they were either dried out or overcooked, again somewhat bland.  For the main course, the chicken curry was spicy, but not in a pleasant way, just a slow after burn from the long red peppers.  The vegetables looked overcooked, but tasted ok.  The rice pudding for dessert was good, at least.  \n\nEven though i only had water with the meal, this was one of the most expensive dinners during my visit to Montreal.  If you're traveling on to Toronto, save it for the lunch buffet at Dhaba, you won't regret it!  Otherwise, Indian food in Montreal doesn't seem to be that great so read plenty of reviews and choose wisely..."
2,"At midnight the fries are a dollar each and burgers are 3-4 USD. They are really delicious and totally worth the money if you have a late night craving. Although I don't recommend the sweet potato puffs - get the regular fries instead. Oh, and the nachos are just delish!"
0,"This complex used to be called Haven Luxury, but has been taken over by a new management group. When the new management group took over, these apartments went to hell. I have had nothing but issues with these people. They have lost 5 of my packages in the office. When asked about them, they say to contact UPS, FedEx, etc. When said carrier tells you they don't have them and that the package was left at the office, the office staff pretty much says, \""tough sh**\"". There priorities are not in the right place. I renewed my leading agreement 11 months ago. Before I renewed, we were promised a renovated gym and laundry facilities. They said they would be ready within 4 months. Guess what, 11 months later and they just opened up the gym. The staff, for the most part is OK. It's a 50/50 chance that you will get someone who is nice and not a stuck up snob. All in all, I would say look elsewhere for a place to live. The area is nice and I have never had an issue with the folks that live around me. The staff has ruined my experience."
2,"I'd give them high marks for execution.  Everything was cooked properly, served promptly and efficiently.  Not a lot of creativity or soul beyond the menu preparation.  Typical for the Vegas high end joints that cater to people on business.  Like everything on The Strip prices are astronomical - I will never forgive a restaurant that charges $125 for a bottle of wine I can get for $25.\n\nThe hostesses seated everyone close together so it became very noisy even though the restaurant was half-empty.  No place charging these prices should make such mistakes. \n\nGreat place if you're on an expense account.  If it's your own money I would pick a different city."
3,"Just like In & Out Burger,  \""keep it simple and they will come\"".\n\nI though my sandwich was small but I could barely finish it, it was dense with meat.  I got the Cheese Steak and I must say it's close to one of the best I've had.  Next time I will get the Bobbie, look up the website and the menu.\n\nI can't wait to go back......"
4,"Dawn is a great trainer!!, calm fun atmosphere. Always willing to go the extra mile to help with your dog and make everyone in the class feel comfortable. I will recommend them to everyone I meet. I will also be taking my dogs back for further training."
1,"Doesn't compare to Mac's Speed Shop.  My first visit went well, a lazy Sunday afternoon with a couple buddies when they weren't too busy.  The menu looks really good but the pulled pork I ordered didn't stand up to Mac's.  My buddy liked it better than Mac's, but I think he's biased since he lives 2 miles from Midwood Smokehouse (to be honest, I live 2 miles away from Mac's).\n\nMy second visit was a complete disaster.  Originally planned to go to Mac's this past Friday (Jun 24) with 5 out-of-town buddies plus 2 others, and got talked into changing to Midwood Smokehouse (same buddy as above).  \n\nWhile their menu states they may run out of bbq from time to time (never seen a restaurant advertise running out of food before, but whatever), they were out of pulled pork bbq on Friday night at 8:00, and also out of bacon wrapped jalepenos (gotta love the south, they wrap everything in bacon).\n\nI ordered a rack of ribs to compare to Mac's and they tasted like they were cooked in the oven as they had zero smoke flavor.  The bbq sauce didn't help at all, too bland.  The waiter hooked us up with wings since they were out of pork bbq and the wings were supposedly smoked but had zero flavor.  No rub, no sauce, no nothin.  The mac & cheese however was very good (close to Mac's).\n\nI tried my buddy's sausage and it was dry and tasted like cardboard.  Midwood Smokehouse has been open for only 2 months, hopefully they step up their game!"
4,"Uh what?! I'm surprised I haven't Yelped this place yet.\n\nI FREAKIN LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! Everytime I visit Vegas, I have to come here. This is one of the shopping malls in Vegas that have both high end and budget friendly stores while admiring the BEAUTIFUL, DETAILED architecture. \n\nMichael Kors, Louis Vuitton, Juicy Couture, H&M, Victoria Secret, MAC Cosmetics, Bath and Body Works, Tiffany & Co. Ahhh...the wonderful list goes on. =)\n\nAnd my 100th review is for the Forum Shops....=) it's only quite fitting since Nick and I both LOVEEEEEEE Caesar Palace's Forum Shops."
0,"Used to be my hobby store of choice.  I bought several RC cars and parts from them.  I have also referred people there to buy drones and RC cars.  I now cannot recommend Hobby Action.  Must be under a lot of pressure these days.  Customer service is now nonexistent and if you are a novice forget about it..  Yes, they have a lot of parts but their customer service is horrible.  Spoke to the owner about it today and his favorite word is policy and he was raising his voice at me.  Not customer friendly..  I walked out and will never be back.  Several other stores understand how to treat a loyal customer."
0,"I usually give fast food employees the benefit of the doubt, maybe in part because I've worked in fast food before, but the service at this location is exceptionally bad as far as how long it takes the employees to get me my food when I'm the only one waiting there for anything. I always seem to be standing around for a good 10 minutes while they don't quite do their jobs. I won't go back."
2,"I got there at 6:30, so there wasn't a line to get in.  When we left around 8, the line was long. I would say it looked like people would have to wait an hour to get in.  Not sure if it was because we went early, but the oysters and sushi tasted like it was sitting there for a while.  So I don't recommend that.  The chicken and waffles is a must.  The meats look delicious, but tasted a bit dry and too dry for me.  The desserts look great and are showcased so.  The gelato is nothing to rave about but the crepes are good.  I think you can have dinner just trying one of each dessert!   Overall, for $55pp, it's not bad.  I think because we went early, the food didn't move as fast, so a lot was sitting around, but food should be consistent no matter when you go right?"
0,"I want to thank Mike (Manager) at Famous Dave's at the Peoria Arizona location. I was part of a large group we have had our local dive club meeting there for the last 5-6 months. Mike was so nice as to tell us that he didn't need our business and we could go elsewhere to have our meeting! We found a great place called the \""Salty Senorita\"" awesome place! Thanks to Jordan and her crew!! We had a great meeting.. Thanks again to Mike"
3,"A little overpriced for the quality. The filet mignon was not as tender as anyone in my party would have liked. Also, the truffle butter as a topping for the steak was an extra $12. It's a beautiful restaurant, great and friendly service."
3,A great place for all appetites.  With a full bar for the adult eaters.
4,Great large chopped salad and toasted ravioli
0,"Dreadful!  Went there Saturday night with a Travelzoo coupon that apparently identified us as unwelcome guests.  They sat us at the worst table ever & refused to move us even though we asked them to & there were other tables available.  We were in the middle of traffic & the table was so small that we had to put things on the floor to fit our food. The food was fair, the service was fair & the margaritas were quite tasty but I thought overpriced at $12.  The kicker was when they added an 18% tip for a party of two with no notification. We usually tip a minimum of 20% & found this insulting & a little underhanded.  We are locals & we will not be returning & will not be recommending this place."
4,"Great local pub with live entertainment every weekend. They have a handle that rotates local seasonal beers and they have a unique selection of bottled micro brews. Something for everyone; music, darts, pool table, drinking songs and pretty amazing bartenders. They say no cover ever but on St. Patrick's Day they do take a donation for the Susan G. Komen Foundation. It's a great cause and who doesn't want to support Breast Cancer research? You gotta love a Pub that gives back to the community. The bar slogan is true: \""O'Connors Pub, where you are a stranger only once\"" I highly recommend."
0,"Even thinking about this place gives me a stomach ache.\nWhere to begin, The atmosphere was fine, I liked the cheesy music on the outdated televisions, but thats about it . At first their whole hospital themed gimmick was cute then just got hugely annoying. The waitress was completely unattentive and even rude. There is NO WATER, which you will be begging for after a bite of their sodium packed but tasteless food. After a bite of their soggy flavorless food and too thick and rich chocolate shake I was ready to leave. I am a HUGE fan of anything that tacky and greasy food. But all their butter filled ingredients were all gratitious and adds nothing to the flavor of  the food. I have a stomach of steel and this place left me with an upset stomach. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"This was a great find, thanks to my friend & yelp! It is a bit pricey but worth it if you're looking for amazing quality and flavor and great service! I had the pork tenderloin, which I never get since it always comes out dry but this was cooked perfectly, med rare and so so much flavor. \n\nTry Mesa Grill, you won't regret it!"
4,"From the moment we walked into Local Bistro, we knew we were going to have a great night. There is an energy in the restaurant that makes one feel at home. The menu is varied and each item we tried was wonderful. A great deal of thought has gone into to the Italian inspired dishes. The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. One must splurge for the Drunken Bread appetizer. It is worth the calories!! It consists of a very thick slice of Italian bread that has been covered in a wine and gruyere sauce and baked. Amazing!  Other winners were the seafood linguini and veal chop. The pizzas also looked delicious.  Desserts were wonderful, too. Two home made ice cream sandwiches with sides of fudge and caramel dipping sauce was a home run.\nA very friendly establishment that we will go back to on a regular basis."
1,"Clever in charging a lot of underwhelming flavors is what I got from my visit.  The crowd is downtown hippsters, who want to be seen. The bar and the drinks were probably the best part of my dining experience.  Staff friendly and helpful.   I watched one of the owners on 3TV mentioned it's not an Asian fusion place..however, the decor is very Asian not the cooks! Very confusing. Regardless Clever Koi is Asian \""inspired\"" however the dishes are not very flavorful, over priced and need salt and other spices.   The ramen was $13 for a little bowl.  The broth is the key.    It tasted like beef broth with a little bit of soy, very tasteless and I would not go again for it.  Kimchi Fried Rice...didn't taste like Kimchi.  The turkey leg..meh.  The buns were the only thing that was \""good\""  I would only go for the buns and the drinks.  Keep working on your flavors and regardless if it's something new and out of the box, it needs to be tasty and Clever Koi isn't there yet."
1,Clam chowder is too salty. Crab sandwich had a little bit funny taste. Hopefully the salads are better.  I'll come back and try again in a month or so.
3,"Outstanding. This place has a ton of variety! We tried both Breakfast (if you hit it right you get lunch stuff too!) and Dinner. Both were fantastic. \n\nDinner had an excellent mix of of cuisine types, tons and tons of delicious seafood...and all of the meat was great! I will agree with another reviewer...the Kobe was a little tough, but shit give it a shot anyway.  I mean it is a buffet at the Bellagio!!"
3,"I keep wanting to call this place Anne of Green Gables...it just fits and if you ever saw that movie or read those books you would see how the two paralell..\n\n\nThis place was just so....GREEN!  It was so beautiful and walking past the dairy farm sealed the deal for me on the whole experience.  There are so many different trails/loops so you can just wander around for hours if you so choose.  The walking bridge, the huge lakes, creeks, trails, etc.  It is just perfect for walking/hiking, bike riding, taking the dogs for a run, etc. \n\nIt is simply peaceful and beautiful here.  I will definitely be back over and over!"
3,"I come here every Thursday to bowl with friends. I am not on a league or anything, just some guys tossing balls down the lane.\n\nThe staff is cool (they better be cool since we come every week AND bring people with us). \n\nThe bar is fairly decent and so is the kitchen. The lanes are nice.\n\nThe Bad:\nI like to consider myself somewhat serious. I am not the best bowler by any means. However, since this location is close to ASU it seems to attract the jock-straps who think it is cool to shot-put a 6lb ball half way down the lane at 35mph. I cannot stand this. Not only does it fawk up my concentration but it damages the lanes. Besides, it makes you look like a douche (well maybe not to your plastic girlfriend).\n\nOverall, permitting I can get in a lane far away from the McDouches, I have a good time... alone or with a party."
1,"This is very simple, no back story needed...\n\nBar service- AWFUL.  My friends and I were treated so rudely by not 1 but 3 bartenders.    It was so bad, I wish they could get negative stars.\n\nFood- AMAZING.  The best pizza in Arizona.  \n\nTerrible service= terrible review.\n\nThe Gilbert location is 1,000 times better."
4,"I had to find something to do with my time as I anxiously waited for little Leela wonder puppy to reach the 12 weeks of age required before I could bring her home from the breeder. And since I had already purchased basically every product she could ever need or want, I decided to search for the perfect vet. I researched and interviewed quite a few places before settling on Animal Care Hospital. The fact that it is so close to me was definitely a factor, but I was impressed with this office regardless of location. I wanted to make sure the vet I chose would be a good fit for my Yorkshire Terrier, so I had plenty of questions to ask and Dr. Bishop graciously answered them all. \n\nAnimal Care Hospital has three practicing DVM's on staff, as well as 4 certified veterinary technicians. All 3 vets are members of the AVMA, AAHA, AzVMA and other organizations. Dr. Bishop is the Hospital Director who started the practice in 1973, Dr. Halver has been there since 1981 and Dr. Temple has been here since 2006. They use isofluorane gas anesthesia, which is the safest anesthesia, especially for toy breeds. They also have extensive monitoring equipment is in place during surgery, including EKG, pulse oximeters, respiratory rate, CO2 monitors and equipment to maintain core body temperature. Since almost every dog will be put under at least once to be fixed, it is good to know that they monitor vitals so closely. \n\nFor routine appointments, they schedule a full 30 minutes. Many of the vet offices I spoke to scheduled as few as 10 minutes, or maybe 15, not enough time in my opinion to really get acquainted with me or my dog, or to ask any questions or share concerns. This may seem silly, but the amount of time the vet spends with each animal can make a big difference in their health. \n\nThe vet I saw , Dr. Temple, was flexible. When I asked to deviate from the standard puppy vaccination plan and follow the veterinary protocol recommended by my breeder (a yorkie lover with 20 years experience breeding show and pet yorkies), she was accommodating and even excused herself to go print some info to re-familiarize herself with this particular protocol and permanently place it in Leela's file."
2,"Coming from San Diego, I am very familiar with Rubio's.  Consistent quality and the best fish tacos from a chain.\n\nThey now have mango quacomole which is essentially regular guacomole with a topping of mango salsa.  The salsa is very good and they will give you some on the side without the guac if you ask (for a small fee of course).\n\nI love the fish tacos and the carne asada burrito.  \n\nBecause it is a chain, you don't have the diverse menu choices the more authentic mexican restaurants do but you get good quality.\n\nI am only disappointed with their specials like lobster burrito that come and go.  They lack the proper flavors and when you like something, it disappears for a long time.\n\nStill, for consistent quality and flavor, Rubio's delivers."
3,"My Uncle wanted to stop in here to look for something so I killed some time looking at shoes as I was in the market for new shoes. The lady helping me seemed to really know her stuff and was great in helping me try on different pairs. At the end of the day, I wound up walking out with a new pair of shoes. Prices were reasonable. The place sells all sorts of outdoor gear for hiking, camping, shooting, kayaking, etc. Great customer service and only wish we had one back home."
2,"Been here a few times and can only rate it as OK. The service has always been good and the food on the mediocre side. The best I have had are the noodle dishes but if you are a sushi fan you will be let down. Sure, if you are looking to do some serious drinking and need some sushi to chase your saki then this is a fun place. But for serious sushi others in the valley are going to be worth the drive. Read Roka Akor."
0,"We chose Hooters instead of Buffalo Wild Wings because we were with a friend who is from Ireland and had never been to a Hooters. It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive, when we were seated, there was less than 10 parties in the whole restaurant. We asked the server to send the manager over and he blamed the slowness on the kitchen getting slammed because there was an event nearby, but we had arrived before \""the kitchen was slammed\"". He said he would look at our checks and get back to us, he never returned to our table. Our server came back and asked if everything had been taken care of and we said the manager never came back, she finally was able to get our checks. The manager did give us a discount off of our check, but I was overall disappointed in the whole experience and felt bad for our visiting friend who's first impression of Hooters was terrible."
1,"this place is just okay....their renovation from Aladdin to ph seems half assed. the place is definitely marketed/pushed onto the young. they have tons of stuff going for that crowd. they have peepshow starring holly madison....which i enjoyed very much! i was kind of pissed off when i made my original review (coming from their spa experience). I do have to say i did enjoy myself here, but wasn't impressed as the higher quality hotels i have stayed at. Though they get huge points for their buffet...it is definitely one of the best i have had! I doubt I would stay here again...especially since construction is going on through las vegas blvd and this place is in the heart of it. my sister (a local) went through hell to pick me up for lunch....so that definitely sucked. my hubby and i didn't drive anywhere for fear of the mess that awaits us outside. good points were the buffet we got comped for, the coupon book, and the free bottle of booze a night promo dealie they have ( i don't drink...but chose stuff for my sister and parents). the staff here is not so great here as well...the service is not comparable to other hotels and one experience with one hotel employee kind of annoyed me. in all....an ok hotel...but nothing great or grand....there are sooo many nicer places to stay than here. it was hilarious to see all the plastered people stumble about the casino with their free booze in tow. their buffet is a must try!!!"
0,Took 28 minutes to get a buffalo chicken\nSandwich. Awful service. Highly don't recommend spending your hard earned dollars at this dump.
1,"Doesn't compare with the other Max's restaurants I have been to. Mid-week and the food tasted refrigerated and been in the freezer for weeks. Filipino food is meant to be very tasty and rich, not americanized and bland. Even my non-Filipino guests who have no idea how accurate the dishes should taste , were not impressed. Hope they listen to the feedbacks here , as I have been eating these dishes all my life and I know how good they should taste. Ambiance, location , parking and decor is great, but we came for great tasting food."
0,"I enjoy finding good \""hole-in- the-walls\"" and was out in Apache Junction on a Friday  evening a couple of weeks back and needed to find somewhere to eat. Turned to my faithful Yelp, but was let down this time around.  This is just a just a hole. Worst meal that I'v had in a very, very long time. \nRead a number of favorable reviews and went with the \""specialty of the house\"" -  fried chicken.  Yes, chicken was fried. Can't say much more. On a scale of 1 through 10, I would give them a 1. Chicken smelt a little ripe and they were the smallest chicken pieces I have seen coming out of a restaurant kitchen. \nThis place is a rural bar/saloon at best, and i think that it gets its faithful flowing from the  local folks as there is nothing else close by."
4,"Had breakfast here today and the food was delicious. I had french toast and it was very tasty. The orange juice was very good and not watered down like some restaurant orange juice can be. The only slight issue was that the \""child's\"" portion of french toast was exactly the same as the adult's portion of french toast. My child couldn't finish all of it so it had to be wasted due to us not being close to home. They do not have apple juice only \""unfiltered apple juice\"" that they call apple cider. The bathrooms were very clean. They serve Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch. They don't serve dinner."
4,"This stuff is as close as it comes to what you find in Belgium. For your first time, I would recommend getting it plain to taste all the sugary flavors. My favorite is the 'Antwerp\"" with the Speculoos ice cream! Gaaaah, I've already been there three times, it's a wonderful addiction! The bossman was super cool, laid back and throughly answered my questions while carrying casual conversation with me.\n\nTheir interior is SOOOOOO much better than what Dozen's made it out to be. Their menu board is an adorable train station-like departure/arrival board. They also have a cute vintage clock and an awesome divided map of Belgian. I love the stools and wall tables, nice and quaint. This place is meant to pick up a waffle, mingle for a little bit, then be on your way. It is NOT A RESTAURANT, so don't expect there to be multiple tables and lots of space to your leisure. Perhaps they will have outdoor seating when the temperatures rise, but you have to pay the city that. It has a similar feel to La Gourmandine bakery where in France they take their viennoiseries and leave. \n\nSo so pleased that this popped up in Squirrel Hill. Don't think it's kosher, though."
4,"Walked in at 3:30PM on Friday to see if they could fix a failed network component external power supply that appeared to have bad capacitors.\n\nAfter the gentleman at the ERC front desk popped the cover open and looked at what they were dealing with I was quoted a reasonable price for them to try to fix it and asked if I wanted to leave it with them or wait. I decided to wait.\n\nERC fixed the power supply by replacing capacitors and had me back out the door in about 25 minutes on a Friday. I was able to get back to my office in time to install the repaired power supply on the network device without any interruption to the start of my weekend.\n\nI will definitely be giving ERC my business for these types of repairs in the future. If they can fix it it's cheaper, faster and easier than used/refurb parts from eBay or unknown internet vendors and hoping the item is as described."
1,Started going to this place because it was so close to my house. I always get my eyebrows threaded but this place makes it unbelievably painful. I think its the type of thread they use. Also I went to the new girl and she messed up my eyebrows and never even apologized and when i asked for the more experienced girl to fix it she had a total attitude. The ustomer service sucks and it hurts wayyyy more than it should.
3,"They have the marriage process boiled down to a concentrated couple of hours. We were in and out and on to the night life in no time. Best part was for a little extra all of our family was able to view the ceremony live via webcam.\n\nThe chapel we were married in was very ...... Vegas. Hot colors, tacky decor, and a hand painted mural as our backdrop. Everyone there is helpful and the whole operation runs like a guided tour of the museum of marriage. You are escorted to each checkpoint via your choice of limo or pink cadillac. \n\nThe only awkward moment was being hit up for a 'donation/tip' by the priest."
2,"So I was reading an online discussion board about the best sandwiches in Phoenix and this place was suggested a few times.  I figured since it was pretty close to my hotel I'd give it a try for dinner one night.  I ordered a Veggie New Yorker.  My first mistake was ordering it on plain sourdough bread...you need a heavy duty roll to stand up to the sauce and the cole slaw they put on there.  I thought my sandwich was pretty tasty, but it wasn't the type of sandwich I'd want to have all the time.  I got potato salad as my side and it was really bland, I wouldn't order it again.  I highly doubt these are the best sandwiches in Phoenix but at least there were a lot of options to choose from...the guy in front of me actually ordered a whole turkey leg!"
4,"We got seated by our host and the first thing that I recognized was that we were sitting at Burt Reynolds table. As I looked around, all the other tables were marked with famous actors' names. Whenever a certain actor comes into the restaurant to eat, they get to eat at their table. It's pretty neat. Clint Eastwood's table was right across from ours, so I went over there and sat down. It sounds weird, but it was kind of cool to be sitting at Clint Eastwood's table and where he had sat and dined.\n\nThe restaurant has an old fashioned feel to it. It has wood paneling and the lights are dimmed down with Sinatra playing in the background. All the staff were wearing tuxedo's. Don't worry though, I ate in t-shirt and shorts. I felt a little out of place.\n\nThe first thing that really impressed me was that when we ordered their famous Caesar salad, the waiter mixed the dressing and lettuce right in front of us. It was one of the best salads that I've had in a long time.\n\nIf you love prime rib, this is the place to go! The Golden Steer is famous for it and they do not disappoint. When I cut through the steak, it felt like butter. The steak was cooked perfectly and I can say without a doubt, that it was the best prime rib that I've ever had.\n\nCoupled with the history and the outstanding food, I can't think of better dining experiences. Every time someone asks me for a dining suggestion in Vegas, I always mention this restaurant. It is a little out of the way, but it is the perfect getaway to the hustle and bustle of the strip."
3,"summing this place up: minimal decor, happy staff, chill drinks, friendly crowd = good vibes."
4,"Camp Bow Wow is amazing. Period. Their facility is huge and clean and their staff - their staff is AWESOME! They are attentive to the dogs, playing with them and taking good care of them. Each of the play area also has a camera you can pull up and watch your pup play - because let's face it even though you're on vacation you miss your furbabies. They offer half days and whole days, longer stays and training. You can bring your own food and they follow all your special instructions for your pets. You get a cute little report card at the end of your dog's visit there - complete with a picture! It is such a relief to know our dogs are cared for when we need to go out of town. I would highly recommend Camp Bow Wow to any dog lover."
1,"The hotel feels old in general. It has this heavy perfume which we didn't care about, but can probably get annoying.\nNo WIFI, no coffee machine in the room. Not a big deal unless you're traveling with a baby and you're forced to spend $2.50 at Starbucks each time you need a cup of warm milk.\n\nWe didn't purchase early check-in, so we left our luggage at the bell desk. When we came back, we had to wait 15 min for the guy to get our bags out of the room, because he was eating a sandwich. He later explicitly complained about us not tipping him.\n\nThe TV reset its volume every night, and lowering it with the remote just made it jump to max, then go down very slowly. Also it was difficult to find real TV channels among all the hotel's self-advertising crap (which includes messages on the room phone)\nThe beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Nothing special, although the slanted windows and the Egyptian themed furniture were cool.\n\nSecurity was extremely annoying about having the baby in the casino. We never had the baby near us while playing, and still we got warned.\n\nThe restaurants at the Luxor have pretty low ratings on Yelp, so we only tried Backstage Deli, which was quite disappointing.\n\nThe monorail seems like it was made to confuse people. It only stops at the Luxor when going north, which means it's faster to walk from the Excalibur and to the Mandalay.\n\nGood value for the price, but I don't think I'm booking this hotel again."
4,Grandioses Pub zum Versaggen oder Vorgl\u00fchen. Wer meint nur einen Nachmittagsbesuch der Empfehlung wegen zu machen bleibt garantiert kleben oder kommt wieder. Top gelegen. Kneipenstyle ohne schnick schnack. Riesen Bier- und Whiskeyauswahl. Whiskey stilecht in passenden Gl\u00e4sern mit einem Wassertr\u00f6gchen.
0,"Let me just say I was warned about the mediocre hair styles, but my own experience solely with customer service guarantee's that I'll never try again.\n\nConvenient - yes\nPrices - reasonable\nCustomer service - HORRID\n\nI called to make an appointment, same day (the latest one available) at 6:15. \n**First off just know when you're calling, you're not getting the salon you're getting some call center that makes appointments for you.** \n\nSO, I knew I wouldn't make it there til about 6:25 because of my class schedule, so I decided to pop by and let them know I'd be a little late.  The receptionists reaction, was almost like \""how dare you\"", and told me they closed promptly at 7 since they need the full 45 minutes.  My response to this was \""so you just put down all styling tools and leave at 7?\"" ... no.  She informed me that she couldn't CHANGE the time of the appointment, but she'll put a note in letting the stylist know.\n\nA few hours go by and I get a call from the salon. \n \""Hi this is [soandso] and I see that you can't make it here til 6:30, so did you want to reschedule?\""  \nNo I want a style tonight for a reason, you dumb broad... \nand again reiterated my question of them just stopping what they're doing at 7 at the same time my mind is racking at why is this SUCHHHHH a big deal??? \n\nThe phone call lasted about 3 minutes of me asking a question and her just repeating that they close at 7. Was a talking to a robot??\nI was pissed, so I canceled and hung up.\n\nMy overall impression is that a fiery hair dragon comes at 7:01PM and if anyone is still working it will breathe fire destroying everything in site and that's scary."
4,Two type of services they offer... Full service (interior and exterior) and exterior washing.  First visit and impress with service. Car is extremely clean with a extra fee to clean bugs out for $5.00 which is fine with me.. Will definitely come back to get my car clean again.. Thanks guys for the awesome job..
0,"Meh...Blah...Robin, don't ever take me to the bat cave again!\n\nThis was the worst New Mexican food and margaritas we ever had! I never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it, but their house margarita just didn't taste right. We got chips and salsa, which you have to pay for, and was told which salsa was mild and which was hot. They must have forgotten the chiles as neither was hot. \n\nWe then asked our waiter about some items on the menu and his response was \""it's popular\"". We then asked what he would recommend and he said \""anything with sauce and cheese on it to cover it up\"". Wow...we looked at each other thinking \""is the food so nasty that we need cheese and sauce to get through it?\"" We decided to split the Blue Corn Enchiladas and the 1/2 Rotisserie Spicy Citrus Chicken. I don't know how to explain it but the enchiladas were tough and the green chile was tasteless. The chicken sounded like it should be spicy with habanero and guajillo chiles. It tasted more like it was smothered in BBQ sauce. It came with green chile mac n' cheese which was tasteless and the jicama slaw, well the jicama was okay but the cabbage was bitter and the dressing did not help it at all. \n\nThe only reason I gave it 1 star is for the cool atmosphere! Inside it's like a bat cave and the outside patio in nice weather looks relaxing. \n\nUnless we hear some significant changes to the food and drink, I think we'll have to hang out with Superman instead!"
1,"Save your money and your time... your taste buds will thank you.\n\nI'll start with the service.  Pretty lousy actually, even for a Korean place.  I had to actually get up and request soybean paste b/c I couldn't wait any longer.  Crappy service.\n\nThe side dishes lacked flavor and pizazz.  Totally unimpressed.  The BBQ meat lacked flavor and more importantly, tasted BOILED.  I'm not kidding my first impression was Yoshinoya beef bowl (Cali folks will understand this), seriously.  I saw no physical indication of bbq'ing, nor did it taste like it.... the bottom of the iron dish was filled with liquid like they had just removed it from boiling water.  We also got this specialty rice bowl with beef and veggies was only good when smothered in hot sauce.\n\nTotally unimpressed and will not come back."
4,"Yelp reviews led us to this breakfast spot today.  No exaggeration, this was our best meal in Las Vegas.  Incredibly friendly service, fantastic food.  Nothing to look at, but when you dig into the gooey cinnamon roll you won't be able to pay attention to anything but your taste buds.  Holy cow.\nEggs were fluffy and not greasy.  Pancakes were equally fluffy, and flavorful.  Bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly.\nI'm grateful this place is not local to me.  If I lived within 50 miles of this place I'd gain 50 pounds in a week.\nOh, and did I mention all this - two entrees, two drinks and a cinnamon roll made by the Tasty Fairy herself- all for $22.  It was their valentines day special.\nTreat yourself.  Worth the car rental to get here."
4,"Last night I decided to venture out and order pizza from a new place I have never ordered before and after reading all the reviews from Pizza Natali I decided to give this place a chance.When it comes to pizza I very critical and reading the reviews on here helped me make this decision easier. I ordered the pizza through Pizza Natalis delivery website which was very easy to navigate and order from.It took about an hour to receive my pizza but once it was received I could smell the pizza from the box and it was just amazing.I ordered a pepperonia,italian sausage, and black olive baked crispy.It was full of flavor and so delicious I was almost inhaling the pizza it was that good. I highly recommend PIzza Natali over any chained pizzeria in the valley as all the ingredients are fresh and to me well it is what a pizza is supposed to be like."
1,"We made a special request, so maybe we put them out of their element, but I didn't particularly like the dish we got. \n\nMy girlfriend and I weren't hungry enough to have our own dish so we decided to share one. She's vegetarian so we asked for the Beef Fried Rice with the beef on the side. The rice was good but the beef mostly tasteless. Didn't taste seasoned at all. I wonder if that has anything to do with our special request? Or if they rely solely on the rice providing the flavor? I would hope that they also season their meat too.\n\nEh, OK place."
4,"Press start is a gaming center. I was here yesterday and was surprised to hear they have the xbox one and ps4 and all launch titles, which was great cause I was unsure if I should purchase the next gen consoles. I walked in and man the employees are kind and very talkative! Which is good cause they make you feel welcomed!!"
3,"Ben & Jerry's - how can you not be a fan? Creamy ice cream with chunks and swirls of awesome. Super friendly people working the bar too. The guy I had was extremely knowledgeable and not wearing the standard tie dye; I wouldn't be surprised if he's the owner or manager. We tried several flavors before picking one and... I wasn't finding one that hit my yen that day. They were sold out of my top picks. I ended up going with something super chocolatey - even when it's not exactly the flavor I'm in the mood for, B&J's is still super tasty. It's not like I'm not going to eat ice cream just because they're not carrying my favorite. Everyone else sampled and picked their favorites and we ate our ice cream while walking back to our cars parked at the restaurant down the street. Very pleasant end to an evening. :)"
3,"My wife and I had dinner there last night. It was superb. \nDon!t know what people are talking about regarding  nachos and sangria.\nThis is totally good French food. The ambiance, the decor, the food presentation were all in keeping with what a high level restaurant should be. The restaurant was not very busy as it was relatively early evening\nSo the waiter did not rush the servings along enabling us to dine at\nOur own pace. Our prize fixe meal was $47each plus wine, tax, and tip\nThe three course meal consisted of a lovely green salad, the entree was salmon for me that was cooked perfectly served with what appeared to be roasted barley mix and green beans. My wife has a veal chop that she liked but what I thought was a little too rare on the inside although\nWell charred on the outside. Desert was a glorious crime de br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was to die for. \nIn summary we both thought it was a good dining experience and a good value for the price.\nWe would go back again and recommend to friends."
1,"Stopped here on Sunday night with a friend.  I hadn't been to Uno's in more than 15 years.\n\nWe ordered 2 brews and a Numero Uno pizza - classic deep dish with tomatoes, peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni.  Server was friendly and professional - he did a great job of checking in on us throughout the meal.\n\nThe problem was with our pizza - it was ice cold in spots.  My dining pal explained that the pizzas are all kept frozen and reheated to order.  Really?  But it made sense, given the ice crystals that I could still see between the crust and the toppings...\n\nOur server took the pizza back to be \""refired\"" and returned about 10 minutes later.  It still wasn't piping hot, but it was better.\n\nThe pizza was good, but the frozen spots were a bit troubling.  Price was on the high side as well - $19 for a deep dish that barely fed 2 people; brews were more spendy than other places.\n\nInterior is nice, but the bar is quite small.  I'd imagine it would be an uncomfortable place if you were waiting for a table during a busy night."
0,"I'm really confused about all the rave reviews for this place.  We went last night based on a neighbor's recommendation and the yelp reviews. \n\nWe ordered 3 siciliana pizzas, and all three were completely charred black on the bottom.  All had a charred chemical taste to the pizza.  The pizza oven at the back had smoke coming out of it.  I've been to wood oven pizza places before, and never experienced anything like it?\n\nWe asked the staff about this, and the teenage \""chef\"" at the oven rudely stated that that was how the oven made them and nobody else had ever complained.  Whoever owns this restaurant should be ashamed."
0,"Lets see 1st the TV and toilet were broke when i got there , I drove in from LA got there late just wanted to sleep , they were going to send someone up to fix this stuff while i waited. I convinced them into giving me a new room. I  go to my truck to drive to the convention i was doing , and discover my truck was broken into , my gps, sub woofer, skateboard , and everything else that wast bolted down was stolen.. so security in the parking garage was horrible.   I gambled for 5 straight hours on a saturday night and not one person asked me if i wanted a drink .The last day when i checked out I told the guy at the front desk how un happy i was about the gold coast experience , and he looked at me and shrugged ... no offer of anything to make me feel better..  the one star i gave it was based on the fact that i won a little cash ... \nI seriously advise anyone looking for a hotel in vegas to stay clear from this place . I work in the entertainment business and travel all over , and this by far is the most horrible hotel experience I've ever encountered . If you want to have a fun time in vegas ..STAY SOME WHERE ELSE!!!"
1,"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \""dirty\"" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return."
4,"Las Fuentes has the best Mexican food in Surprise! Very nice staff as well. We eat here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. Portions are huge! The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! My favorites are their shrimp Caesar salad, shrimp al mojo de ajo, any burrito and we always enjoy their buffet as well."
0,I sent an email thru the Mastro website to let them know I got food poisoning at one of their restaurants. No response from them yet. I guess the restaurant doesn't care about their customers...
4,"Omma God, I love it here. \n\nI crave crave crave their bibimbap, a big portion of rice and veggies and beef and egg served in a hot stone bowl which crispifies the rice to the most perfect of textures.  In my universe, there is nothing better than hot crunchy rice. \n\nMy boyfriend lived in Korea for a year so he enjoys trying the various Korean restaurants around town for a dose of nostalgia. He misses the food there and I'm not sure anywhere in montreal has nailed it for him, but he did enjoy this place as well.  We got a bottle of Soju to share, which if memory serves correctly was a $15 drop. In Korea they are $1.  \n\nWay over-priced, so I can only afford to go here every few months, but good quality food served by a truly lovely staff."
1,Hopefully the organizers will learn from the feedback they receive from this event.\n\nThe lines were ridiculously long - sometimes 45 minutes up to an hour for a few small bites of food.  \n\nI would be furious if I paid full price.  Thanks to Groupon.  \n\nAn event like this can be pulled off successfully - just look at Uncork'ed which probably has 3 times as many people.   I don't think I ever waited more than 5 minutes for food.  All the lines were in and out with the exception of maybe 2-3 spots.\n\nI hope to attend another Night Market but hopefully they'll learn their lessons and provide a better experience.
3,"Frozen Grasshopper, my first shake EVER.  The presentation of it caught my eye first.  As a waiter who walked by had it on a tray, I just had to ask what it was called.  After contemplating, I order the grasshopper and enjoyed until it got to that melted consistency - then I just gave it to my b/f to finish.  For food, I was having a difficult time deciding (once again), but got the Gold Standard Burger w/ steak cut fries.  A pretty juicy burger that had good flavor.  I was so full when I left! ... full, but satisfied."
1,"Whyyyy.\n\nCome on MGM. I know Excalibur is the cheapest hotel of your properties, but this is kind of embarrassing. When nearly all your food is tough and inedible, it's time to step it up. You know something's off when your staff (who are really nice +1 star) starts apologizing before you even say anything. I mean, I get that you're not aiming for Aria status, but when you're a Hometown Buffet at a Vegas price...\n\nSigh. I love Excalibur, but I do not love your buffet."
3,"I am VERY picky about take-out Chinese/Asian food restaurants, and had completely given them up for many years  However, this place is legit: Clean/well kept, good quality food, decently priced."
2,"Some good experiences and some not so good.  Shop around all the dealers, ask questions on all transactions.  Review hours."
4,"Isaac was prompt, efficient, and most important , his job knowledge.  He took care of our two leaky faucets quickly, and thoroughly explained the work he did.  An invoice was provided along with a parts and labor guarantee.  This is a family run business,\nand I highly recommend that you call them with any plumbing problems."
2,"Stayed here for two nights last weekend, room was small but clean with one exception......a fish hook stuck in the carpet that I had the pleasure of stepping on.  Luckily I reacted fast enough to not have to make the emergency room visit to remove said hook.  I do not blame the hotel for this but regardless it wasn't pleasant.\n\nAll in all a decent stay."
3,"Banana Republic stocks lots of seasonal fruit and veg, much of it from East Lothian. They get their supplies in every day so it's always fresh. They sometimes get some exotic things in just for the kids to try. Dragon Fruit was just one of the strange fruit on offer. Their prices are so reasonable, it don't know how they do it. The shop is always busy, and it's great to see a nice greengrocer display on the high street. The staff are always cheery, even on the coldest day."
4,"We did an ATV tour yesterday and had the most amazing time. The owners/tour guides are the most friendly thoughtful people I have met in a very long time. Our guide kept the speed appropriate for our group, took lots of pictures and videos and even stopped at a gas station on our way home. I would highly recommend using them because they offer the best rates along with the best service. Can't wait to come back and try another sport they provide!"
3,"This place is a diamond in the rough. The neighborhood, not so good. The building, run down and dodgy. The Food, fantastic and delicious. The service, absolutely welcoming (this may be in part to the owners knowing my GF and her family).\n\nWe ended up getting 3 dishes and I wish I could tell you what they were. However, I didn't order and everyone was speaking Cantonese so... We ended up getting a short-rib dish, a fried noodle dish and a beef and rice noodle dish.\n\nThe short ribs were alright, they had a tasty, albeit very strong 5 spice seasoning to them and were a bit on the chewy side but the flavor was good.\n\nThe Fried Noodle dish was very tasty. The noodles were fried separately from the rest of the dish so they retained a crunchiness while eating them, the bok choy and gravy were very complementary of the various meats in the dish.\n\nThe spicy beef and rice noodle dish was ordered with some random greens added. I think they just threw in whatever was fresh. Either way, my brother and GF said they like that the best. The gravy was good and the beef was tasty. My favourite part was the choy sum, crunchy and delicious.\n\nThe place was pretty full when we walked in and got pretty loud with the other two large groups. Once one of the groups left the noise level decreased exponentially and the owner came out and started chatting it up with everyone still dining.\n\nAs stated in other reviews, there are many non-menu items/specials posted to the walls but they are all in Chinese so I will just leave that stuff to question (though they might be fun to try one day)."
4,"Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...\n\nThis vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.\n\nLucy had a nice first visit today. :)"
3,"We decided to take the Nosh food tour as we saw a groupon advertised prior to our trip to Las Vegas. We were skeptical about what go expect on our tour but as food and restaurant lovers we decided to give it a shot and boy are we glad we did. Our guide Joel was very knowledgeable about each location and gave us a great overview of Las Vegas restaurants without being long winded or boring. We stopped at 5 different restaurants within caesars: Beijing noodle house no. 9, Payard's, Old homestead steakhouse, Gordon Ramsay's pub and Slice. We were very much impressed with the quality of the food, the time the managers of each restaurant gave our group to explain highlights of their restaurant and the efficiency of the whole tour. I highly recommend the Nosh food tour to anyone who loves trying new food and restaurants and need a lil bit of a break from the regular Las Vegas scene."
4,"Unique, quirky atmosphere. Laid-back vibes. Good place to relax.\n\nYes, the Bad-Breath-Burger is amazing. As is the West of the Andes sandwich (with tuna thanks very much). If you like seared tuna as much as I do, this is a good option.\n\nGinger beer is highly-recommended. How many places can you even order that? \n\nThe service was quick and sincere.\n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, this would be one of my go-to places."
1,"Seating:  Confusing; the table set up is strange and it's unclear if you should seat yourself or wait to be seated.  They left the table dirty that was next to us the whole time we were there, and it was actually connected to our table.\n\nDrinks:  My wife's mango lassi was completely forgotten (thankfully we weren't charged), and my water was never refilled even though it was empty before I got my main dish.\n\nFood:  Overall very good; bold flavors, great textures, and the prices are extremely reasonable for what you're getting.\n\nService:  This is the doozy.  The server was cold, inattentive, distracted, and careless.  At one point while we were eating we saw a few people walk in and then stand there awkwardly because they were not greeted.  Our server peeked his head out, saw them, and then continued talking to someone in the back.  It blew my mind.  The young girl who brought us our food seemed nice though, and was the only pleasant encounter we had while we were there.  Honestly, my wife and I are both caucasian, and I wouldn't even mention this if I didn't feel like it was part of the reason why they treated us like we weren't even there.\n\nOverall:  A restaurant can serve the best food in the world, but if the service is as bad as what we experienced tonight, it just wouldn't be worth it to go back.  We'll consider ordering takeout, but that's it.  We truly felt unwelcome there from the time we walked in to the time we walked out."
1,"Best thing here was the salsa. Bland run of the mill mexican food. You can get the same thing at filebertos for a lot less. Ordered the beef fajitas. No seasoning, very bland FLAT grilled meat. My fault for assuming \""grilled\"" meant flame not flat. Condiments include an abundance of sizzling onions with some bell pepper mixed in and a few slices of avocado (no guac), beans and rice and 3 tortillas. The hotter salsa was actually pretty good. Good flavor, nice heat.  Maybe there is better selections to try off their menu but the fajitas were terrible.Service was sparse and slow. Just a dissappointing experience all around."
4,I have been using them for years! Wonderful work and great attention to detail.
0,"We drove from Avondale to the Arcadia location, waited over 20 minutes and were bumped when a 5 top a waitress knew came in and asked for her. We were fed some line about how they were on the list, left before their name was called and it's policy to seat people that do that ahead of those that were waiting at the restaurant.  The name she pointed to was a party of 4. Customer service is lacking. Every other restaurant i know of, and have worked for, has the policy that if you're not there when your name is called it is crossed off and you go to the end of the line. The food is good but we don't wait an hour to be treated like that.  We ended up leaving without being seated and going to Taylor's."
0,Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware has the worst customer service ..stay away.
1,My co-worker and I stopped in early for lunch today. Really happy with the food and service.   I gotta say that the stinky wild eyed bum yelling at his imaginary friend coming in and out was alarming.  What is weird is you're promoting him to come in and bathe in the Soft Drink Fountain.  I really wanted a refill and you could not pay me to go near it after seeing him sticking his fingers in where the soda comes out.  Yuck Yuck Yuck
4,"Our second visit. Phenomenal sandwiches and baked goods. I had the Eggplant Grilled Cheese sandwich today - the best sandwich I've had anywhere in months. Wife had the Waffle, Eggs, and Ham sandwich with a rosemary bechamel sauce. Killer. We will be back....often!!"
4,Gas is $.30 cheaper here than in San Diego! Got to love not paying over $4/gallon.
2,"Known at my work as \""the man on the corner\"" the holyrood cafe is the main supplier of breakfast rolls for the work force. It's all pretty standard fare, and fairly standard price. The falafel wrap was surprisingly tasty though. I think I'd give this place 4 stars if they got a decent fridge for their soft drinks. Open fridges suck, frankly. They don't really cool down the drinks, and actually heat up the room their in. \n\nYou can sit in but there's nothing particular to write about in that regard. All in all pretty good but not quite great."
3,"Everybody's got their own opinion of Amelie's, so let me make mine to-the-point:\n\nDecor - love it. Unique, fun, and eclectic. My girlfriend thinks it's adorbs. I like it cuz it doesn't look like every other damn place in town.\n\nSavory food - like it. The sandwiches are AMAZING, as is the quiche. The salad choices are fine, but they don't really do anything that would be considered an entree.\n\nBakery - Also like it. Everything Amelie's does is wonderful. You are *required* to try the chocolate torte sometime before you die. There is no option here. The twice-baked croissant makes me masticate just thinking about it. The tea cakes are om-nom-arrific. The French macarons are excellent. However, Amelie's commits a major cardinal sin here that I simply can't avoid writing about: THEY LEAVE THE FRENCH MACARONS IN THE FRIDGE ALL DAY, MAKING THEM HARD AND CRUNCHY. I mean, seriously, who the FUCK decided this was a good idea?! Have they never had real macarons before?! Now, I know what you're thinking: \""Aubrey, not *everybody* knows how a macaron should taste.\"" That's true, gentle reader, but if you're going to fucking make macarons for people to purchase and consume, you should know how they're stored / kept fresh. Any other way, and you might as well hold your glaring deficiencies out for the world to see. In this case, Amelie's is walking around with a hideous facial birthmark.\n\nCoffee - meh. Ees okay. Not great. The melange riche is burnt-tasting, while the house roast is better, but still thin and bland."
0,The food is great but the service And manager are horrible. She does not know good customer service or mannerism while she is talking. Byebye good food all because of your ill mannered management.
3,"I'm not sure why, but it seems as if all of these \""sister hotels\"" end up falling a little bit short of the original. The Palazzo isn't as good as the Venetian, and similarly, Encore isn't as good as the Wynn. \n\nLet me start off by saying that I'm still a fan of Encore - the rooms are beautiful (5 stars!) and they have all of the fun stuff like XS, the Encore Beach Club, and Surrender. However, there's just something lacking. If you stay at Encore, you have to keep walking over to the Wynn anyway - all of the casual dining options are over there, and they have a larger casino that just feels more upbeat. \n\nI guess the best way to put it is this: Encore is great as an attachment to the Wynn, but it couldn't stand alone as its own hotel and casino. \n\nSide Note: They're good about safety! I lost my room key somewhere in the casino, and the rest of my group had left the hotel to watch a show elsewhere. Because the reservation wasn't under my name, the guy at the front desk wouldn't issue another room key for me. It made sense, so I didn't complain...but damn! I had no choice but to gamble some more. Two hours of roulette later, my friends came back and I was finally able to go back to our room...broke, of course."
4,"Anyone can take a machine to a car, but Steve is  not just a guy with a buffer, he runs a complete operation.   Every car's needs are different.  Mine was an issue of some type of industrial over-spray.\n\nHis follow up was great, as was his concern for my complete satisfaction.  The best thing about Steve is that he's not done until you're happy with the results.  He truly stands behind his work."
0,"My family and I came across this restaurant by accident. We came in with positive attitudes and hoped for a satisfying experience. Unfortunately, we were not prepared for what we encountered. It took about forty five minutes for us to receive our food in this empty restaurant, but I hoped the food would be worth it. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and the chicken was smothered in sauce - being hardly edible. The grilled lemon chicken that two other family members ordered needed to be returned due to it being cold. The grilled pork was satisyingly warm in temperature, but nothing special. The server never officially took our drink order, and never came back to refill our water. This was definitely not a very pleasant experience."
4,"What a terrific meal!  We loved the menu from the pate, to the beef carpaccio, to the scallops, everything was well prepared and tasty. Make sure to order the brussel sprout side, it was amazing!"
2,"Amazing food, horrible waitress, we asked for a teaspoon and she said they don't have any, then brings a teaspoon anyways???? Idiot! She should be fired."
0,"Way to ruin a good thing PTs!  Sitting here 5 min ,\nPlace used to have the best PBR on this side of town.  The renovations are nice.  LED lighting brightens up the bar but looks half ass installed.  Nice pool table area where the restaurant side used to be.  Yep no more good breakfasts with the family.And the very worst! This place used to have the best steak sandwiches in town. Now it's some processed and high amount of preservatives.  Steak was grey !   The corporate monster strikes again."
2,"Good ethnic food in Phoenix, recommended by my local friend.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great lunch specials!!!\n-Koobideh was delicious, very generous portions\n-Great for a quick meal if you let them know you are in a time crunch\n-pitas were soft and fresh\n\nCons:\n\n-Location is kind of weird \n\nVerdict:\n\nWould come back here but probably only when meeting in the area."
0,"The merchandise in this store is usually similar or  the same as Ross, TJ Maxx or Marshalls but it's 20%  more! The customer service is non existent.  I feel lucky if I can get a store employee to say hello. I just came from the store. Woman at the counter didn't say anything when I walked in, Asian guy also working, he walked by me probably 5 times and never said a word.  I was going to buy a wool wrap but when he took the sensor off it he pulled the fabric and made a big hole, he wasn't even going to say anything he just folded it over good thing I saw it! He finished ringing me up and asked me if I wanted a bag for my purchase? Really?f What a novel concept?  Didn't say thank you, good bye just mumble and grunted a few unrecognizable words?  Next time going to drive the 4 miles to TJ Maxx when I'm in the mood to spend money on something I don't need$$$$$$$$$"
1,"Pei Wei, why oh why did you think it would be smart of change your menu and the look of your original concept?  I personally think it was a bad move!  I hate that there are not many of the original items on the menu at this new, remodel.  \n\nI had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland!  I also miss the separate line there use to be for people who called in or ordered online.  I probably won't be coming back to this location.  If I need to I will find another location that has the old items because those items are what made Pei Wei one of my favorites!"
2,"Legendary Pittsburgh restaurant/nightspot, past its prime.  Interior was last updated during the era of Drakkar Noir and mousse, is now threadbare and chintzy, in a style that a few years from now will be considered edgy, cool and retro.  Restaurant itself is located in the upper lobby of a glass and steel building housing Mellon Bank and the local offices of Jones Day; would've been a hot prom date destination for a rich kid in a John Hughes movie. Service is inattentive and lackadaisical. I ordered a glass of wine that was tantalizingly described as 'unknown' on the menu. Wine by the glass is frequently a burn, since you never know how long ago the bottle was opened, but at a place which boasts of its carefully curated wine list, it's an enticing dare. Unfortunately, it turned out to be limp and shy, something which my waiter should've warned me off of. Plate came out hot, meaning my order had been sitting around as forgotten as my meal is now.  A chicken something, nothing memorable.\n\nIt's too bad, because this place obviously has an interesting past and still has genuine character, and the staff all seem to have been around a while.  It seems like a place you could warm to (and vice versa) if you lived in town and were a regular, and if you're just visiting it's definitely worth a look if you're into local history, or a serious cosplaying late 80s fetishist. But if you're not any of those things, you'll probably be happier eating elsewhere."
3,"I stopped by this location after having tried a previous Black Bear Diner in Tulare, CA while traveling.\n\nThe food here is good.  While reading the about the history of the Black Bear Diner on the menu, it mentioned the original establishment was set up to offer generous portions of home-style, comfort food at affordable prices.  The restaurant does it well.  The food isn't world class, or the best I ever ate but so far I've enjoyed all the dishes I've had while eating at this particular chain.  They give you large portions and the dishes are relatively inexpensive.  This is a good place to go if you're looking to have a good full meal without breaking the bank.  I came with a group, and everybody was satisfied after dining here.\n\nThe menu seems to be consistent between all of the Black Bear Diners I've been too.  I didn't notice any local food or deals.  Even though we came for lunch at about 2pm, the waiter informed us that they were still serving breakfast!  We also asked if they served the dinner portions of the menu at this time, and she said yes.  However, she stated that some of the sides wouldn't be available at this time such as the baked potatoes until after 4pm.  I suppose depending on the time you visit here, it may limit the menu selection you have to choose from.\n\nI tried the Mickey's Chicken Pot Pie.  This dish comes with your choice of a side dish.  I had the Vegetable of the Day which was sauteed vegetables.  It was a mixture of a carrots, yellow squash and zucchini.  Unlike the dinner specials on the menu, this dish doesn't come with soup or salad.  The Pot Pie comes in a medium sized ramekin bowl.  The filling is spooned into the bowl, there is no bottom layer of crust to the \""pie\"" just the top layer.  The top came out browned and flaky.  The filling itself was quite good.  It had large chunks of chicken.  There was a large amount of peas in this pot pie.  I happen to like peas, so this doesn't bother me.  However, I'm not sure if it was normal for there to be this many peas in the pot pie, or if I just happened to get a scooping with a lot of peas.  So for those who aren't that big of a fan of peas take note!\n\nIn addition, many of the dish come with corn bread muffins.  My part and I ordered extra corn bread as a side to go with our meal.  There's nothing special about the corn bread.  It tasted great and they were served to us piping hot out of the oven.  I happen to think they tasted better after they cooled down a little bit and had a chance to solidify.  They also don't seem to crumble and fall apart as much as the  freshly baked hot ones.\n\nOverall, I definitely like this chain and would visit them again."
4,"I go here 3 or 4 times a week to get my all natural healthy foods.  The staff always remembers me and treats me so well.  The biggest issue at grocery stores is when there is a line of people and the staff doesnt open another lane, drives me nuts!!!  At this store, you will never see more than 3 people in line.\n\nTheir prices are great and the quality of produce is always on point.  Go Bashas"
2,"Ask anyone in town who is a local where to go eat steak, and invariably this place comes up. Walk in the place, and you may have to check to see if you are in the right place. When I first walked into place back in 2005, I was miffed as one side of the place is the dive-st looking bar, and the other is the steakhouse. We turned around and walked out, but after hearing for years how good this place is, I had to go back. \n\nGo here if the steak is important, and the aesthetics are not. If you are looking for a much nicer LOOKING place, then go to Delmonico's, not far away. Everyone I ate with at the Tornado loved their meal (2 steaks, one fish), as did I. Champagne Dan, bartender extraordinaire and food lover to the max (@ the Concourse Hotel - Shout Out to CHAMPAGNE!) recommended either the Venison, or the Flank steak, which he claimed is the owner's favorite. I got the venison, accompanied with a side of hash browns, which may sound strange, but they were damn good and crispy. Haven't eaten much deer in my day, but it was pretty good. \n\nBottom line - if you want steak, here is your place."
0,"Staying at the Gold Coast for a conference this weekend. Went downstairs for a late night munchie. Shelby was speaking to a couple on the short side of the bar so I stood on that side to order figuring she'd obviously welcome me when she was done. I looked over at her a few times so she'd know I was waiting, she never even looked at me though I know she had to at least see me out of her periphery. When she was done chatting she walked away down the long right side of the bar, never even came over to me. 3 gentlemen sat down at the long left side, she walked right up to them all smiles and started helping them. I sat there and stared at her, we can all feel when we're being stared at and we look. Nope not her. Finally another bartender who was going into a cooler looked at me, smiled and asked if I was being helped. Thank you Ashley!!!!! The whole time I was standing there, Shelby never once made eye contact or anything. There were a couple male bartenders who came in after I'd gotten help, they even made the polite eye contact and smiled in acknowledgement of my presence. After I got my item I asked Ashley for the other tenders name and told her what happened. If you look gay (I'm a butch dyke) and you come to this Friday's don't plan on even being acknowledged if Shelby is working, she OBVIOUSLY has serious gay issues. I'll be taking the rest of my dining off site this weekend. The Gold Coast lost it all because of this bartender. A fair number of the people that are with this conference are LGBTQ."
4,"I loooovvee this place. Its so nice and its cheap, but the best part its that the sushi is good! Everyone is always friendly and its a great hangout spot"
2,The food was decent so they lose a star there.  We tried the chicken which had good flavor but was a bit dry.  The BBQ sandwich was much the same.  The ribs were killer though.  And the insane amount of side they have is awesome.  All 4 sides we tried were really tasty.\n\nThey lose another star because we sat and watched person after person that ordered after us get their togo orders before they even bothered to tell us they messed up on our order.  Their saving grace was the gentleman that work the register there telling us he was sorry and gave us a free dish.\n\nI will try this place again hoping it was a fluke.
0,"Take a minute to brainstorm everything you hate about Walmart.  Every generic , stereotypical thought you can come up with about this corporation.  Go ahead, I'll wait a little longer...\n\nThis Walmart embodies every single one of those stereotypes.  There is nothing good I can say about this place.  Ok, maybe one good thing: the people watching here is top notch.  Especially on a Friday night (or the 1st of the month).\n\nI have been to this Walmart 3 times.  I refuse to ever go again.  It is seriously that bad.  This is no exaggeration.  You have been warned."
2,I finally got a chance to try out Maki Taco at the Food Truck Rally in Noda.  I met up with a few friends to find out what the big deal was about these food trucks.  I ordered the Spicy Crab Tacos w/ avocado and the Shrimp Hibachi. The food was delicious but I wanted more for the price I paid.  Call me cheap but 2 tacos for $8.50 was kinda pricey to me.  I ordered the Shrimp Hibachi for my daughter and it was $9.50.  It was definitely a kids meal size but a grown up price.  The shrimp were small but overall it was delicious.  I was still hungry after devouring my tacos. LOL.  The wait wasn't long and the service was friendly.  I would consider coming back and trying other things on their menu.
2,"For our weekly pizza delivery, we decided to try something new and got Manolo's.\n\nWe opted for the largest size thin crust with half pepperoni and half sausage. We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.\n\nThe pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.\n\nFeedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.\n\nI have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.\n\nOverall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.\n\nI'll be back!"
1,"The most prominent flavor in the food here is the produce, which is fine when you're using high quality produce, but I ordered Pad Thai and expected to taste at least SOME peanut sauce. The Udon noodles were extremely overcooked, soggy, and watery. The best thing I had was the Thai iced tea, but even that wasn't worth the $3.95 price tag. Lunch was about $30 total for two people and two iced teas-- not worth it."
1,"I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.\n\nIts not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?\n\nAs stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. \""I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes\"". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them. \n\nFOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure."
4,"This place is BOMB. For $5, I got the best burger I have ever had, some delicious and perfectly seasoned fries, and a drink. How do you beat that? And the guy behind the counter (Brandon) is really energetic and nice. You need anything, just let him know and he takes care of you. The first time my friend and I went in there, he asked if we had been before, we answered no, and he gave us the whole meal for $3 and thanked us for coming in. I was already sold and I hadn't even tasted the food.\n\nThe place is also real quaint - total hole in the wall/dive with a really cool patio out in the back. There is literally no reason for anyone in the Phoenix area to have not tried this place and had it completely change their life.\n\nThat's about it."
0,"Horrible Valentines Day experience!! I booked a \""Celebrity Spa Suite\"" over 2 weeks before the day. We got there right at check in time (3:00pm) and waited 45 min JUST to get up to the counter! These lines weren't long by the way. I get up there to find out they don't have my room or \""any king beds in the whole hotel!\"" They offered me a \""Bungalow Queen\"" which is certainly a downgrade! It's Valentines Day I want a king! I was told its not a downgrade because it's still a suite. Pssh... That just means a couch in a sitting area apparently, and wonky lights.  Manager ended up giving us a food and beverage credit which we made sure to use ALL of! \n\nDon't make a reservation here... They might not have it when you get there!"
1,"The manager, a man, was very kind. The staff could not accommodate a simple v design for my nails saying they could only do it in gel.  That it would take too much time... after I had already made an appointment and was 30 min early. The nail tech didn't speak to me at all. Very cold and aluff  feeling. The work was good, but I asked on the phone to have nail art. Not impressed at all! Not happy at all. I was referred to bond first,  and I should have gone there."
1,"I had very high expectations for Frijoles, and I think with a few changes they could turn things around.\n\nThe positives first.\nVery clean and well decorated\nTacos had a layer of cheese that was a nice idea and tasted delicious\nGreat Guacamole\nGood salsa\nFor some reason the fountain coke was really good\nVery friendly staff\n\nDown sides\nHard to figure out how to order, looks like a Chipolte when you walk in but you order at the opposite side where the register is.\nNo pictures to see what the food will look like.\nSneeze guard at head level makes it hard to communicate to staff.  (health dept thing not the restaurants' choice I'm sure.)\nVery loud in dining room\nChips were passable but way too salty.  Possibly try less salt and a finer grain like popcorn salt since a little goes a long way.\nExpensive for the portion size.\nCarne tasted washed out like it was sitting in a pan and lost its caramelization.  Maybe I should order fresh off the grill next time?\nOver all I have high hopes for Frijoles and think they could do very well with a few changes.  Good luck guys!"
2,"I have very mixed feelings about the Mirage. Some things were great, others just OK, while some things sucked ass.\n\nFirst the good: The renovated rooms are very nice. Flat screen TV's plus all kinds of ports for computers, video games, and an Ipod dock. Lots of granite , very comfortable chairs, all around a tasteful, comfortable room.  Also the air-conditioning was quiet and very cool. The only complaints about the room were the cheap plastic toilet seat that wouldn't fucking stay up when I was urinating, and the shower/tub combo seemed claustrophobic and I couldn't help but get the entire floor wet when bathing. \n\nThe buffet was also very good, and laid out well, no bottlenecks of people standing holding their plates impatiently waiting for food (hear me Paris?) The asian items were my favorite along with huge cold crab legs. Japonais restaurant was excellent. Though expensive, the service was amazing and every single item was yummy.  \n\nI did have good luck in the casino on the slots, despite Mirage's reputation for having a tight casino.  I played ALIEN slots and won like $150 in a matter of seconds when I hit a bonus round and blew the alien out of the airlock.  I screamed out loud I was so happy.  I never ever win anything. That made my fucking day!!\n\nNow for what was bad:  Caribe Cafe--this place sucked big steaming brown loafs! The service was atrocious, the menu very limited and expensive, and the food was dog shit. All big strip casino's have a diner/coffee shop usually open 24hrs, but this place was awful in every way, even the coffee sucked!  Downscale, older places i have stayed at such the Imperial Palace, or Tropicana had better  coffee shops.  \n\nThere also seemed to be a lot of small technical problems which were frequent.  The card keys were stubborn and had to be inserted repeatedly EVERY SINGLE TIME I entered the room.  When I contacted the front desk they talked down to me like i had in IQ of ten.  Scripted, condescending answers and questions--\""Did you insert the card right? Make sure the strip is facing this way, etc. etc\"" I also had problems with my MGM-Mirage players card having to get a new card TWICE within a four day visit. Each time the ignorant, inept employee gave me a totally different (wrong) explanation on why my card kept malfunctioning.  I hate it when places of business refuse to honestly answer questions and give scripted or made up bullshit answers.  The final demonstration of incompetence was on my final day in Vegas when I had a slot machine voucher I wanted to cash in.  The computers were down and it was impossible to cash in the voucher, even by going to a live teller instead of a machine.  Thankfully the voucher was only for $7.67 but still...\n\nThe only time the hotel incompetence worked in my favor was the mini bar in the room.  Me and my friends had some of the tiny liquor bottles in the mini bar and should have been been charged approximately $36.  Well, it's been over a month and no charge on my card!  Woohoo! I shoulda drank more;)\n\nSo, would I stay at the Mirage again? Probably not. Despite the reasonable rate of $77 a night and the nicely updated room and excellent location, there was just too much spotty service and general hotel incompetence to make me wanna risk it."
0,"My girl friend and I ate here for lunch one day and sat in the bar area, at a booth. They took over 10 minutes to bring our drinks and then this bartender named Jonathon came over to take our orders. Jonathon was SO ANNOYING. He kept cracking jokes and offering appetizers, side salads, desserts... things we just weren't interested in ordering. He recommended a dish for me, I ended up not liking it and when he asked I told him I didn't care much for it, and he just shrugged and walked away. He seemed to ignore us for the rest of the meal. It was awkward and I won't go back simply bc I don't ever want to have Jonathon as my server."
2,"Braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel.  Very nicely decorated with good service but the food is a bit overpriced for what you pay.  We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since it's conveniently located inside the hotel.\n\nThe breakfast buffet here is $15/person and does not quite worth its value.  It's basically $15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items (eggs, bacon).  Lunch/dinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches.  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown, expect the typical American grill.  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless you're looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurant."
0,Decent food.  Comparable to Panera Bread.  Terrible service. Extremely expensive ($40 for three sandwiches and three drinks).  Unkind staff.  Impolite.
2,"Five of us went to Bryan's for dinner.  The table agreed the brisket was by far the best thing any of us had.  It wasn't dry as one of the other reviewers mentioned, but it was incredibly tender.  The brisket is the only reason we gave it three stars.  \n\nI know barbecue can be pretty personal on preference but none of us liked the pulled pork at all.  We ended up throwing it away!  The beans were a bit spicy (which I liked others did not).  The coleslaw was average as was the chili.  I am told the ribs were also fine but not great, so really other than the brisket there wasn't much to rave about."
2,"Pink Taco...clever name guys.  I visited this restaurant located in the Hard Rock Hotel on the last evening of my visit.  I ordered the fish taco plate which came out incredibly fast!  It seemed like the food was on our table within minutes of actually ordering it.  \n\nMy hypothesis is that they have figured out how to manipulate the time-space continuum and are using this knowledge to gain that much needed edge in the restaurant business.  I could be wrong.\n\nBut, I digress; my girlfriend had come here before and loved their chili relleno.  So much so that she got it again!  Being from San Diego, it will be hard to please my appetite for Mexican, but Pink Taco made a valiant attempt.  I would not feel right giving this place a 4-star rating just because my dish would not hold up to some of the spots I'm used to in SD.  \n\nI would recommend it to anyone visiting the Hard Rock."
3,"I have been to this Sam's Club twice since moving to the Las Vegas area and have gotten gas here once. \n\nThere was a little wait for the gas but hey, the prices are cheaper than the competition so everybody and their momma are here filling up their tanks. \n\nThe Sam's was average. Nothing stood out so 4 Starz for not being dirty or the people being unusually  impolite. Can't ask for too much more than that."
4,"I have promoted shows out of this venue, checked out some of my favorite local bands here, and spent my last birthday here. The owner has always been very hospitable and professional. The security staff is very professional and the bar tenders are always pouring amazing drinks. Needless to say I love this bar anyone who is a fan of live music at intimate venues should like the bar's facebook page for regular updates on upcoming shows."
0,"How Disappointing. A \""French Bakery\"" that makes awful croissants. One would think they would make the best ones in town. My advice for the best croissant in the area, go to The Fresh Market. (And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market.)\nAlthough the product comes in frozen (I know, I know) at TFM, when they are baked just right, they are excellent. Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and I'm happy...\nI did try some pastries at Amelie's but nothing to write home about. I tried a baguette and it was edible. I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen. \nNot worth the drive from Cornelius."
1,"The $8 falafel sandwich was good with green cabbage and hummus, made a filling lunch on the go.  But aside from the sandwiches, everything here is wayyyyyy too pricey.  I paid $9 for beef cigars, and it was four tiny rolls of beef fried in flaky dough.  Put together, they're like one egg roll's worth of food.  I literally laughed out loud when I opened the container and saw how little that $9 bought.  :-("
1,"This place was a big disappointment. The menu looked fantastic and the food was good, so why the bad review? First off is portion size. I ordered an \""entree,\"" which was the Kobe Beef Flat Iron. I'm not much of a fish eater, but my wife is. Anyway, my entree come out and it looked more like an appetizer with a splat of potato pur\u00e9e. I'm a high metabolism carnivore and this was a huge disappointment for me, especially at $48!\n\nMy wife got two sushi rolls. She liked them, but again, they were extremely expensive. We spent about $130 and were hungry about 3 hours later. \n\nThe service was extremely slow, which is frustrating when your hungry and in vegas."
4,"Gene and your staff, I want to thank you for the service you provided my automobile.  Today I went for an emissions test and passed thanks to you and your team for fixing the issues that needed addressing after I had failed 3 areas the first time I went. The team at Gene's was very friendly and trustworthy.  I am new to Arizona and don't have a mechanic and now I do.  I found them on Yelp after I saw endless positive reviews and gave them a shot.  The endless 5 star reviews are correct because I witnessed it first hand this week as I was facing an emissions nightmare that was addressed and fixed by Gene and his crew,  Will see you again soon and thanks again."
2,"Tricky Tricky Mr. Puck...\n\nI stopped by to eat with some friends while staying at the MGM Grand. It is one of the more visually pleasing restaurants in the hotel. But Ah! Don't be fooled by the fancy shmancy set up.  \nThe design/layout is what lures you in, but the food and service don't coincide with the \""ooh lala\"" look and feel of the restaurant.\n\nRoasted Chicken Pizza (Roasted Chicken, House BBQ Sauce, Corn, Pasilla Peppers, Red Onions, Cilantro):\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H5RWZB8RrQoK6RevxxDAzw&userid=B8CqppjOne8X4RSJ5KYOvQ\n*I thought this pizza was good, but it wasn't above average. The crust was too hard for my taste and the BBQ sauce was overwhelming after awhile. I can usually fit about 3 (or 4 or even 5 on a good day) slices of pizza in my belly but I got tired after 1 and 1/2. That is so not like me. Even my boyfriend said, \""You don't want anymore?\"" with a surprised look on his face. lol He knows I love me some pizza pie!\n\nApple PIe (Oatmeal Crumble, Cinnamon Ice Cream, Caramel Sauce):\n*The oatmeal crumble was a nice touch, but I didn't love the crust or the apple filling. I've had better. The cinnamon ice cream was good.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qSKv1xTclyWYmPZo2iylKg&userid=B8CqppjOne8X4RSJ5KYOvQ\n\nThe service is what really ruined the experience for me. We spent a lot of time waiting, especially for the food and for the check at the end of the meal. Our waitress wasn't very friendly either. It bothers me when waiters or waitresses just take their time dilly dallying like the rest of us don't have things to do. I needed to get ready for the David Copperfield show dammit! lol \n\nOverall, not the best but it's okay."
1,"Was it just me?  I tried two different beers here and they both were bitter.  The one that was supposed to taste like Blue Moon didn't.  \nThis place seems to have a few locations, so someone is drinking this beer; but, as a beer lover, it won't be me unless they prove to me that they have one beer that is not so bitter.  I'm not into the beer bite thang at all.\nYes, I realize some people just loooove their garlic fries, but, for me, the smell was so overwhelming it was making me sick..and they weren't even my fries but my friends.  I tried pushing them so far from my nose as possible...just sickening to me.  \nNow to the food:  I ordered the pork sliders as an appetizer.  The pork was ok but the buns were kinda hard like they had sat out for an hour with no cover.  Huh?  That never happens at a restaurant and my friend (another good cook) had the same.\nThe service was fine, the location is great, the waiters were friendly...but I just don't like their beer or food all that much.  \nUnfortunately, Gordon, I have to give you a \""meh\"" and 2 stars.  I do so much want to love you but sometimes it just doesn't happen....sigh.\nReminds me of different guys who looked great on paper but I just could...not...get...into........yeah, been there, done that."
4,"Super yummy!  I have only had their lunches but I hear breakfast is amazing.  I recommend the turkey jalapeno press, the Biltmore Club chicken sandwhich or the chorizo burger.  Their salads are also lovely."
3,"I'm surprised this only has a 3-star average. I thought the food was great. We went for dinner, and they brought us pretzel breadsticks and seeded bread to start. I got the steak with onion marmalade  and he got the chicken. Both were delicious and well done. The fingerling potato side wasn't so good though, and overpriced at $12. The decor is cute but the outfits they make the servers wear is god awful--skintight newspaper print rubber? No one looks good in that, and it certainly isn't appetizing."
2,"Roasting Company to me is like a Boston Market substitute (gasp!!!).  It's not that it's not good, but I just like Boston's chicken a little better because it's seasoned a little better.  But since Roasting Co. is close to work, it is a nice alternative when I plain refuse to go to yet another fast food joint.  \n\nThe food is fast, consistently decent and relatively cheap.  I normally get the quarter dark, but today I decided to get a half dark (which is only $1.53 more) and now I have leftover for another meal... much more economical :)  Seasoned corn was a little disappointing for it's not seasoned much.  Squash casserole was ok, not super cheesy so I feel like I was being semi-healthy.  Overall the veggies were both little too blend for my taste.  \n\nIt's a solid place for lunch, especially they have a few outdoor tables so we can also get a dose of Vitamin D on a sunny day."
3,"Big chains are important to submit reviews for.\nEven though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.\n\nThis Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.  \n\nFood is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.  \nThere seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc. \nThey do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what. \n\nBreakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.\n\nI can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.\n\nInside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.  \n\nYou kids get the hell off my lawn."
2,"First time I went it was really good, but the second time it wasn't and customer service was really bad and they overcharged us.....what's up with that?"
4,"Best pancakes EVER! Enough said. Can't vouch for anything else though...so you're on your own. \n\nSeriously, if you find yourself in Las Vegas with a car or money in your pocket for a 4 mile taxi ride (against traffic so it's only about 10 minutes), then make sure to visit BabyStacks Cafe #2. It is well worth the visit and a good break from all the nasty cafe food on the strip!!!"
4,5 star worthy. I'd give it 6 stars if Yelp would let me. It's all about the hot signature sandwiches here. All sandwiches are made to order making them fresh out of the oven. Fresh ingredients (make sure to add bacon)  served up on a nicely toasted Artisan baked loaf and topped with unique sauces and spreads. Try the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (my favorites!)
1,"This place is beyond overrated.  I don't want to knock the service because that was very good (though I feel we were somewhat pushed to order more than was needed) but seriously, what a scam.  One dish was just bad. Pasta was fair and the fish was good but way to expensive (and why not bring the potatoes after they filet the fish so they are at least warm).  Bartolotta was too busy kissing the ass of the people who bought white truffles for 90 bucks a piece, and hanging with the truffle reps to care about what was going on in the kitchen. I wanted to say something to him but ultimately decided against it but am now regretting it.  I usually use Yelp to write about good meals that I've had.  Enough people complain about bad meals.  This was one situation that I felt I needed to share about."
1,"Corporate,  are you listening??  Although I admit, I love your product, what the hell is going on in this store? \nWhile I was waiting (26 minutes) for my order for two, THREE different customers came back in to say their order was wrong or incomplete.  Laura, your counter lady, handled it as best she could (2 stars are for her only)   I believe all the orders originally were through the drive thru. I have been to this store many times and have only gotten lucky to have a good experience two or three times. \nI refuse to go to the drive thru anymore, the order is either wrong or the chicken is extremely small. At 5 in the evening, you should not be out of ANYTHING, especially your most popular chicken choices. \n\nThis location is run worse than the VA. Heads must roll; it's the only way to get right with us. \n\nPs. Please keep Laura. She's full of personality and quick."
1,"I remember in elementary school I had a friend of mine who regaled me with wild stories of how excellent the buffet was at the Rio. Flash forward some 20 years later, and we're visiting a friend from Vegas who can't wait to take my girlfriend and I to this place. SURE! I sez.\n\nWhat I found was that the Rio buffet was like every other buffet I've ever been at in my life. There's a lot of food, but there's a lot of mediocre food. There's an Asian section that tastes like every take-out place you've ever had, with greasy duck, glaze-saturated pork, dry satay chicken skewers, and sushi with tough seaweed. There's a meat section with cut sirloin steak with absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance, not flavor. There's a seafood station, which beyond the unlimited crab legs, is filled with fried foods, not fresh foods.\n\nA few positives: great pie, good ham, half-decent Chinese siu mai.\n\nWe got in for about half the usual price ($16 as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of $32). Even at fire-sale prices, it still wasn't enough to get me to go back. Maybe this was a three-star place, but after hearing so many people in my life talk up the magic and wizardry of Vegas buffets, I was left especially disappointed.\n\nSo, here's my advice: is a buffet a personal challenge to you to stuff your face with four plates of food, or do you want to just have a decent dinner? I'm the second kind of person, so next time I'd recommend to do as I do, and put that $30 towards one of the many, many, many exceptional restaurants on the strip that are competing on the basis of quality, not quantity. And guess what? You'll still get a filling, delicious meal!"
2,its walmart...nothing else to say
2,"Realizing I wrote a review for Magic Wok under Teriyaki Kitchen, I wanted to say a few quick words about this place before my accidental review is read by too many people.\n\nThis is an old-school place. The food is pretty good, the prices decent, and it is close by. It is the sort of place that I can see using for carry-out from time to time. Service was decent, and it is a clean place, though nothing fancy.\n\nI had Sukiyaki, and it was okay. My wife, however, had the katsu chicken and it was really great. I plan to go back and try some of their other dishes and update the review as quickly as possible."
1,"Roller coaster is the only real reason to come here.  Other rides are just ok, and the miniature golf is actually decent as well.  Arcade has a lot to choose from as well.\n\nProblem is that this place is unsafe.  There's gang-types all around you, including the parking lot.  Will I get shot?  Does he have a gun?  And to top it off, you're looking at $20+ to have a good time here, and they sandwich you between the option of getting the all you can ride option, or pay per ride (both seem like too much $ for what you get)."
2,"I would have paid ten dollars more per entree if it would have been a little bit better. The duck was excellent but my husband's lamb was kind of disappointing.  The server got a little snooty when we ordered water instead of drinks.  Don't get me wrong-- the duck reallywas tastey, but it looked like the best meal there."
1,"Slow service. A lot of people who were waiting before us left cause they were so slow, AND there were empty tables. Got seated and waited a good 30 min for our food.\n\nBurgers were good, I got the oxtail chili cheese fries. So not worth it, barely any oxtail, it was more like beans, cheese, and fries. Overall, stick to the burgers."
2,"Nice place, and nice sweet pastries, coffee, tea and scones.\n\nMore trendy/updated than classic.\n\nBeen here twice, but i rather prefer Peters Yard"
2,"This fast food restaurant is located in the food court of the Galleria Mall.  \nWe both enjoyed our gyros, but our piece of baklava was drier than a bone."
0,Needed something cheap and quick to eat.. decided on this and it was a bad decision. It looks like Panda Express but tastes nothing compared to it. Had a funky sour taste. \n\nNot a fan.
0,"First and last time going to this place. I got there at 12pm ordered a jerk chicken sandwich and a salad for my wife. At 12:40pm the manager comes and tells me its going to be a few minutes more. To which I replied \""What\"" you mean to tell me it takes u 40 minutes to make a salad and a sandwich. And the place was not even full of people. Bad service do not recommend going there."
3,"I can't go bowling anywhere else...before midnight. \n\nSunday through Thursday, after midnight, each game is only $1.00! My hubby and I bowl regularly and once we discovered that bowling here was a buck after midnight, we made it a ritual to go at least once a week. Other than the fact that the lady who rings us up is kinda weird and doesn't listen to you, and you get stuck by either really annoying people or those \""young un's\"" on dates that have nowhere to go, so they go bowling and suck face after every frame,  the place is okay.\n\nI love that there's no smoking in the bowling area. That doesn't stop people from trying, but generally, it's nice to bowl without running the risk of developing emphysema. \n\nBowl after 1am and there are a few regulars, people on dates, some even bringing their kids and bowl while they entertain their dates at the bar (yes, this happens and it shocks me every time), and then the bar closes. \n\nBowl after 2am and you basically have the place to yourself...and the weird lady behind the counter who put the TV on behind her on and watched Criminal Minds or Law and Order SVU if it's on. \n\nBowl after 3am and you really are by yourself and the weird lady with no personality. Maybe a security guard or custodian. And by then, you are now bowling a 45 and need to go home. \n\nI love this place. But I REFUSE to give it a 5 because of the weird lady with no personality to never listens. We ask every single time, \""Can we have a lane far from everyone?\"" She says, \""Okay,\"" but never does it. \n\n**Plus its 8 minutes away from my house. 6 if I hit all the greens! :D"
2,"It wasn't horrible and it wasn't mind-blowing. Average burger with steep prices (well, you are in Vegas). We were really hungry and on our way to the Secret Garden at the Mirage. Limited combo options, if you choose a special burger then the price of the friesa and drink skyrocket the bill. The milkshake was dense and tasty, but half the cup was frosting (which I don't really care for). Simple and clean presentation. The server was timely and attentive. She didn't hover too much or ignore us. I liked the house pickles (mild brine). Honestly, for the price, I would have rather paid for a restaurant experience at a Master Chef restaurant or something."
2,"Considered one of the most kid friendly spots in Vegas, we decided to enjoy spring break here with our 7 year old daughter and 14 year old son. The beach is awesome BUT you have to get in line 10-15 minutes before 9am to ensure you get a spot on the beach - for a hotel this size, the beach doesn't seem to be big enough to accommodate half the guests at any given time. Several heated conversations on the beach about chairs and what not. Luckily, we were there bright and early every day and got a spot! The beach has a small, fast food style cafe that serves sandwiches, chicken fingers, hot dogs, burgers and some breakfast foods. Also has a sit down grill type restaurant - nachos, burgers, chicken fingers all of which looked amazing but tasted awful :( stick with the chicken fingers - can't go wrong. The elevators were a problem, frequent LONG waits in lines to get up and down to and from the hotel room, that was beyond annoying! It felt like you had hit the jackpot on the rare occasion you didn't have to wait several minutes for an elevator. The checkout line was ridiculous but they did offer free bottled waters to offset the inconvenience of the wait :) \nThe room was a little less than spotless, the bed skirts were filthy. One time when we got back to the room the bed was made but the comforter was rolled up on the floor in a ball (huh???) like housekeeping was called to an emergency in mid clean up. Our room never had that just cleaned feel to it. The bathroom was cool, the TV in the bathroom was a bonus. \nAll and all - I'd stay here again with the kids but elsewhere if it were just the hubby and I. Very kid friendly!"
3,"Amina has moved over to Snapdragon, so that's the spot.  Losing a star because a star left...."
1,"This is my fourth time staying at the hotel and I must say that the quality of service, venue up keep, and overall hotel experience is NOT what it used to be. We pay way too much money to stay here for it NOT to be up to par!!!"
0,"I went to this place when it first opened and many times thereafter. I also enjoyed some of the best Irish food to be had in Vegas at Wooloughan.  I went back a few days ago and what a surprise, remember this is supposed to be an Irish Pub, but it was and is no longer such a place. The new place has the same decor but that is where it stops, \n     The menu had a total of 5 Irish dishes on it. The rest were plain bar food, hot dogs,hamburgers, and stuff like that. I ordered potato soup leek soup and got a thin soup with TexasToast !. Asked for soda bread and was told they don't serve that any more.  I ordered corned beef and cabbage and got chopped cabbage,fried in bacon grease and sliced deli corned beef that was over cooked. It WAS AWFUL. \n     If you want Irish food, DO NOT GO HERE."
0,"I am embarrassed to say how much I paid this company for nothing - thousands and thousands of dollars. Reports were terribly late, my reps cared nothing about me or my company and the customer service was abysmal. Additionally, they charged my company for 2 months of service after I cancelled, then acted like I was crazy when I very kindly & calmly asked them to remove the charges worth over $5000 - they acted like I was crazy. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone or any business. Shady and concerned only about THEIR bottom line, not the growth of YOUR business."
1,"Went to Nofo with a group of friends on a Thursday night before we headed to a concert at The Visulite.  This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit there.  Until then I had always had a positive experience.  Good food, nice atmosphere, good service.  But during our last visit we had a less-than-stellar experience.  We waited for close to 15 minutes before someone came to get our drink orders.  We then waited another 20 minutes for them to take our food orders.  We were there almost and hour and a half before our food arrived. By then we had to scarf down our food in order to make it to our show. \n\nI think the most frustrating part of the experience is that they didn't seem to be particularly busy and seemed well staffed.  In addition, we had to plead with our waitstaff to get another drink.  We payed our bill and rushed to our show.  \n\nTypically, you would think that 2 hours is plenty of time to have a drink, eat and make it out with time to spare.  I can't say I really got a chance to enjoy the food.\n\nI'll probably give them another chance because everyone has their off days but they won't be my first choice next time we head to The Visulite."
3,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today to get deluxe pedicures! We both have jobs where we are on our feet all day and good pedis are a must for us. The salon is nice and very clean. The staff is friendly but a little forgetful. This place would have gotten five stars but there were a couples of problems. First off make an appt here! They were so busy! My boyfriend and I sat with our feet in the water for an hour before they started our pedis! Sitting and soaking for 20 mins is ideal for me but an hour!? Even I was getting bored and impatient! Second, they were rather overwhelmed and over filled my boyfriends pedi bowl soaking our shoes and my purse on the floor! And then they didn't bother to clean up the water! And lastly even though my bf and I both got deluxe pedis they did not do the same things for both of us. I don't know if they just customize the service depending on your needs or what but it really just seemed like my bf's nail girl skipped his salt scrub and mine skipped my leg massage. Overall, it was a good pedi. Our toenails look perfect, clean and shaped. Our feet are soft and smooth, that cheese grater really worked! I was nervous about it, but it was not uncomfortably and my feet really needed it. Okay selection of polish but I think I will bring my own next time if I want a specific color. We will be back but next time with appts."
3,"Took my father here for his birthday and it was quite the experience.  L'atelier is famous for its open kitchen.  They give their guests the option of sitting at the bar where they can overlook the open kitchen and watch all the chefs cooking their food.  My father and I each ordered the Discovery Menu for $168.  Seems a little pricey for a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but hey...it is JR.\n\nThe Discovery Menu consisted of 10 courses (including coffee).  There was a lot of foie gras in the menu that evening and my cholesterol level felt like it was going to rocket out of the building after the meal.  But the foie gras was cooked very well and full of flavor.  I was very impressed with the Langoustine carpaccio.  It was my first time having Langoustine and I really enjoyed it with the combination of spices.  The Dover sole filet wasn't anything too special though.\n\nWe also shared an order of the le'burger, L'atelier's signature burger.  It consisted of a kobe beef patty with foie gras and WOW was that delicious.  The best burger I have ever had, I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who visits L'atelier.\n\nThe service was also very good and attentive here.  Always making sure we didn't have an empty glass of water and the waiters are were very willing to make small talk.  Seeing that it was my father's birthday, at the end of the meal they presented us with a selection of 6 different kinds of dessert cakes, all of which were delicious.\n\nThe price is what stopped me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, but my father and I still enjoyed our meal very much."
4,"We had dinner in this restaurant . Everything was awesome! Customer service, food, life music and good Italian vine.I suggest you reserve table before coming. Very nice place!"
4,"Brunch here was one of the most amazing meals of my life! It was SO incredible! \n\nOur waiter was the sweetest guy and I loved starting the meal with a bloody mary prepared for me table side :) The waiter used all of the perfect ingredients and even muddled the garlic in the bottom of the glass! I ended up adding a little bit of A1 to make this the best bloody mary ever. \n\nFor food, the waiter gave great suggestions. The croque monsieur was insanely delicious and came with perfect french fries. The waiter brought out their homemade mayonnaise with truffles for french-fry dipping and it was perfect too. \n\nThe crab eggs benedict was also insane. I usually don't like hollandaise sauce but this hollandaise was delicious. The crab meat was so succulent and perfect.\n\nThen, there was the special mac and cheese with blue cheese, truffles, and more. It was so rich and perfect! \n\nThe restaurant is super classy and the sexy paintings on the wall are pretty cool too.\n\nI cannot wait to come back here and expect to visit during every future Vegas trip (which I expect will be a lot of trips! ;) )\n\nThank you Morels for being UNBELIEVABLE!!!"
2,"Went to Rufus on the Thursday night before the August long weekend - it had been recommended to us by a local Montrealer. At first the girl who greeted us could not find out reservation for 8. The bartender stepped in to help us... and we were seated. It took about 20 mins for our server (the original girl) to take our drink order and we should have assessed that that was a good indication of the poor service that would follow. \n\nI don't know if it was because we are anglo (and this area of town - Little Burgundy/Grifftintown is predominantly franco) but she was slow to help us, rude and kept ignoring our requests for drinks...water...napkins..etc. At one point my husband walked up to her in the restaurant and asked politely if she could come over as we all wanted to order more drinks - at which point, she proceeded to have a 10-15 min conversation with some guys sitting at the bar! I was in awe. \n\nI must say though - the food was very yummy. It seems that they change their menu periodically - when we went, it was a take on Japanese street food. The soba noodles were extremely flavourful,...agedashi tofu - YUM..and who doesn't love dumplings? \n\nCocktails were pricey - $14 range. I ordered a margarita and it was straight up but NOT over ice...\n\nThe decor leaves much to the imagination...let's just say it looks better under candlelight."
2,"The hotel is in a good location, and the public spaces are great - beautiful lobby and trendy rooftop bar. No complaints about check-in or out, but housekeeping staff was pushy. I had to repeatedly ask them to go away as I had decided to work from my room one morning, despite the do not disturb sign I'd hung. The rooms are very small and old. There's no bureau or any drawer space, the room and bathroom are cramped. Room seemed clean, although the bathroom was a little moldy. Plumbing is pretty weak and there was no tub, only a small shower."
3,"Another stop on our aquariums on the Strip tour. \n\nThe way the Shark Reef is decorated is quite nice actually. We didn't use the audio self-guided tour because we're lazy like that. I'm sure it was informative.\n\nThere's more than just sharks. There's also some interesting fish (like piranhas) and reptiles. It's not the best exhibit we've ever been to, but it was pretty fun for us. We like aquariums and the like. \n\nIt gets really crowded at the shark exhibit but presumably that's what everyone's there for."
0,Good but weird waitresses put labels on ur bottles of orange juice quit smelling my cup to see if it has alcohol in it
0,Omg!! No Napkins!!! Unacceptable!!!  Shift manager should have asked one of her employees to go out to the dollar store & buy napkins for customers. Instead of asking her employees to apologize  for the inconvenience. No one had Napkins! Employees were unhappy customers left upset. I will not return to this Dunkin donuts!! Buy Napkins!! That's what petty cash is for. Not great managerial skills disappointed!!!
3,great burgers!
3,"Being that I was staying at the Monte Carlo hotel, I thought it was convenient that the hotel has this awesome lounge. Not only does it have plenty of space for you to sit with your significant other or a few friends, it is also open 24 hours a day so your party self can get some drinks in throughout the day. I don't judge!! The place isn't poppin but it def has a nice vibe to it. It's not overly crowded and it has great music playing. I made a quick stop here for just a quick drink and my bartender was fun and outgoing. The lounge is clean and prices are also really decent so I would recommend you stop by here especially if your home for the weekend is the Monte Carlo hotel."
1,Very disappointing.  Great food but absolutely glacial service and microscopic portions. My waiter would disappear for 15 min at a time on at least four occasions. Dinner took twice as long as it should have.  I had to go eat a real dinner after this disaster because I was still so hungry. But what little they did serve me was excellent. So this is another case of the front of house failing the back of house. Management needs to apologize to the chefs. When I let the matre d know how disappointed I was he said he was sorry. Not as sorry as I was picking this dog for my last dinner In town (second to last because I had to go get food after this starvathon)
2,Have been there a couple of times. Food is good. Service is always slow. Last time we were there my husbands salad had an ant crawling around. I was very disappointed that no one came over to apologize nor did they offer to discount or comp it. Not cool.
1,"In sixth grade my BFF had her birthday party at the Luxor. Back then this pyramid was the hottest thing on the Strip and thanks to her parents renting us girls a room we had tons of fun jumping on the beds.\n\nSo it was with some nostalgia that I returned here this past weekend after getting a room for $66 on Priceline. Following a long flight from New York (that was delayed over three hours) all I wanted was a shower and a nap. But that was not to be at the Luxor, at least not very quickly. A long line loomed at check-in which I found only after being accosted by employees trying to get me to buy show tickets. Their opening line \""Where are you from?!\"" left me nonplussed.\n\nOnce I finally had a room key in hand I trudged up to my room only to find it either occupied or unclean - possibly both. The bed was unmade and it wasn't clear if someone was still in it. And a half full cocktail sat on the desk.\n\nI quickly closed the door.\n\nI was then treated to another journey downstairs on the impossibly slow elevators to fetch keys to a new room. At long last I made it to my room in the tower. This was apparently an upgrade.\n\nAll told, staying at the Luxor is not an experience I'd like to have again soon. But if you're simply looking for a decently clean place to crash in between trips to da club and/or the slots, it's passable."
3,"Did the Groupon thing with no problems.  Had an early dinner on a Friday night... the place was eerily quiet.  It's in a basement.  My husband kept suggesting that it used to be a morgue (too much Ghost Adventures, clearly).  The decor is straight out of a nursing home (seriously, it is pretty creepy - pink cushions and fake mirrors?  ick).  \n\nLuckily we were there for the food, which we definitely enjoyed.  The zucchini strips were a bit too thin, and I thought there would be some shellfish options with the Groupon deal, but oh well.  What we got was good.  The tiramisu was homemade and delicious.  The pasta sauces were good (maybe a little salty).  I don't know if we'll be back, but it was an overall enjoyable meal (excluding the potential ghosts, heinous decor, and total deadness on a Friday)."
3,Great place on Tuesday for cheap tacos and beers.  The outdoor patio is awesome when the weather is nice.
4,Dr. Gundermen is the man! He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%. You get a nice massage before the adjustment. You get asked questions. Get to ask questions too. Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.  Very friendly and affordable. They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people. These guys rule. As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.
2,"Who doesn't love \""date night\"" with their daughter?  Not this guy...but...this guy doesn't exactly find \""mall dates\"" as his idea of fun.\n\nBuild-A-Bear Workshop was a nice stop on our tour of the mall.  A white bear covered in hearts...a fairy princess outfit and Hello Kitty undies to boot.  My daughter absolutely loved the whole process.  We even got to kiss to little hearts and put them in her bear, \""Ella Heart's\"" belly.\n\nMy daughter enjoyed the experience so much, my son insisted on getting his own on our \""hang out\"" day.\n\nIt's a bit spendy, but worth it."
0,"Wir waren dieses Jahr zum zweiten Mal in Vegas, Zwischenstopp auf RV-Rundfahrten (RV = Recreational Vehicle, auf Hochdeutsch Wohnmobil). Dort bietet sich f\u00fcr RVers der KOA Circus Circus Kampground an.\n\n\n Will man von dort auf den Strip (so wird landl\u00e4ufig der Las Vegas Boulevard genannt) - und wer will das in Las Vegas nicht - muss man jedes mal durch das Hotel Circus Circus ziehen, es gibt keinen anderen vern\u00fcnftigen Weg.\n\n\n Was man dort zwangsl\u00e4ufig zu sehen bekommt f\u00e4llt im Vergleich zu all den anderen Glamour-Hotels am Strip v\u00f6llig ab: Ziemlich verpl\u00fcscht, angestaubt, im Vergleich billig. Entsprechend wirkt auch das meiste Publikum - low budget tourists. Aber sicherlich kann man zum \u00dcbernachten hier Geld sparen gegen\u00fcber den wirklichen Topp-Strip-Adressen. Der Casino-Bereich - ja auch durch den muss man gehen, das ist \u00fcberall so gewollt - ist schriller, bunter und lauter als vergleichbare andere. Wenn schon gambeln, dann empfehle ich wegen des Spa\u00dffaktors den Besuch der Casinos in den besseren Hotels. Gewinnchancen oder besser die Verlustchancen sind \u00fcberall eh gleich.\n\n\n Circus Circus liegt zus\u00e4tzlich leider am Ende des Strips, also fast eine Meile vom Zentrum des Geschehens. Drum herum derzeit viele Baustellen, die ziemlich st\u00f6ren, aber m\u00f6glicherweise besseres f\u00fcr die Zukunft versprechen."
1,What is the mgm anymore without its lions now they have put translucent cover over the entire lion habitat.  How retarded! !
2,"So this is a place, with food. That much cannot be denied. But you know what? It's a small airport restaurant, and if you're flying in for a $100 hamburger, then a $100 hamburger you can have. And patty melts. And salads. And whatever other Sysco-type delights you might expect. (It was even prime rib night when we were there, but as it was 20 minutes til closing time, I thought better of it.)\n\nI had a perfectly reasonable patty melt myself, and I enjoyed it. The service was really nice, and the views out the window of the evening traffic on approach were phenomenal. Plus, *tons* of model airplanes hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, which was a fun touch."
1,"well we had breakfast here...... big mistake...... the hostess was taking a waiting list, our friend jim tryed to give him his name to put down... the lady had to repeat jim back to him 3 times cause she didnt understand english, finally she wrote down GIAM, ?? wtf.... after waiting 1 hour just to be sat , we found we were being skipped due to her poor language barrier, and then we weresat.........\n\nThe food? yep, worst than dennys... need i say more? naw im good."
1,"I was referred to Penny Electric to run a 220 line for my new spa.  The estimate (done by the owner) was reasonable and I liked him a lot.\n\nUnfortunately, things went a bit south when they did the actual install.  I failed my initial inspection with the county because they did not run the ground-wire from each pump to code.  Instead of running it outside the spa and burying it, it was done sloppily and the ground-wire was just run through the cabinet.  When they came out to redo the ground-wire, the electrician busted an irrigation line.  It was obvious to me that the person knew they hit the line because they reburied only that portion of the work (even though the rest of the work was visible because it needed to pass another inspection).\n\nThey did eventually fix the irrigation line issue, but the amount of back and forth was just not worth it.  I would expect the work to be done correctly the first time and not to have the crew come out another two times to fix their mistakes."
0,"Great for a car wash but oh my god on the up-sells when you get an oil change. Seriously they are so hard to deal with when they upsell you constantly. Windshield, detailing, fluids, filters..it goes on and on. It just really ruins it and I will just go to walmart where they won't hassle me non stop. Lost customer."
0,This place is straight garbage.  If you enjoy waiting in line to be thoroughly disappointed then go here.\n\nUnless you had the foresight and budget to drop the cash on a booth (not really worth it for the wife and I alone) your basic admission allows you to stand in a series of hallways with security guards constantly reminding you to keep walking.  This place is FILLED with red tape and security guards.  Not my idea of a good time no matter what celebrity they keep announcing is attendance over the sound system.  The dance floor is pretty lame too and is packed to the gills WAY beyond what is comfortable.\n\nCheck out some of the lesser hyped but more reasonable and fun clubs in Vegas- Studio 54 and Rok are good choices.
4,"King of night clubs Is the best to book events. The owner Joe always made\nSure my group and I had a great time. He's very informative, oranized and helpful with everything. His parties are always a blast!!! Joanne"
4,"Damn do I love me some Smiling Moose. I have been coming here since it was way more divey and still had holes in the walls (way back before those walls were red, and way back before food was served.) I like everything about this place. I like the upstairs venue for shows. I like the big screen in the back and the random whatever that's on it. I like the drinks named after movies, particularly the Captain Spaulding, and I actually do enjoy the apathy of the staff. I like to drink and be left alone with other heavily tattooed people that like to drink and be left alone. Occasionally, we feel like being social creatures, and when we do, we come to the moose. I have always felt welcome here, and my non-tattooey friends have never felt unwelcome, and that's the most important part. This place gets a rep for only serving a certain kind of people and nothing could be further from the truth. Every bar has it's niche, and some don't seem too welcoming to those who don't fit the profile, that's not the case here. The bartenders aren't going to kiss your @$$, and that's just fine because that's not what I'm looking for. They are going to make you some killer (moderate pun intended) drinks and they are going to laugh at your drunk stupid self. I love this place.\n\nOh yeah...the food is actually pretty awesome."
3,"Good Food, but I wish they had the sandwiches available for dinner.  The Mac and Cheese was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  Also the atpmospher was excellent, they really do a great job of giving it that old english world charm.  The only thing I would hold back on is the bean sliders.  They were good, but a real meat slider or  a pot pie would be perfect for this place. overall great service and a great atmospher!"
0,"I concur with the prior reviewer...this place is horrible to deal with. RUN, DON'T WALK away from this company. They have the most unresponsive customer service program around, they do not deliver what they promise, and they consistently fail to maintain adequate contact with their customers. I have tried to contact management in the past to deal with my complaints, but they shield themselves with rather powerless customers service reps....sending their reps \""into the trenches\"" as it were while the middle managers hide from any responsiveness and responsibility. The CSRs (once you can get them) are polite and concerned but clearly without adequate information or authority necessary to resolve a problem. Find another company to get your medical supplies from, this one is owned and run by hucksters and sham artists....that....or incredibly inept business managers! It is apparent that all they care about is the profit with no concern about the consumers they are supposed to serve."
0,"They only had 3 people working on a Saturday afternoon, one person was doing a family members nails, when others were waiting  to receive a service. One of us received a pedicure right away while the other person waited with cold water for 20+ minutes. I would not recommend this place unless you have no other options."
4,"I rescued my ball of canine fluff (Harley) from the Humane Society two years ago. What I didn't know was that when I adopted him, they decided to neuter him before I took him home. When I went to pick him up Harley had a brand spanking new cone around his neck. So came the search for a veterinarian stat and I needed one who could be trusted to take top notch care of this mischievous dog. \n\nI learned quickly that a dog is expensive and especially with medical bills, shots, office visits...and that's just hitting on the basics. As I was visiting the Petsmart one day, I came across the Bandfield Pet Hospital conveniently located inside the store. I decided to begin chatting with them to see about pricing and they told me about their amazing deal. For between $25 and $35 a month, they offer a service where you get unlimited office visits, several shots, an annual dental cleaning and many more benefits for your animal. I cannot tell you how many times this service has come to the rescue for me. \n\nI absolutely love the Bandfield staff. Harley has spent his fair share of time in the doctor's office and every time he visits, the staff is extremely friendly and nice. They always get Harley in and out quickly. The vets know what they're doing and they take great care of the animals. After a visit, Harley always leaves happy and refreshed and normally with a clean bill of health. \n\nThe greatest part about Bandfield is that they are conscious of the economy and know they don't push unnecessary medications or products just to make money. They really do look out for the customer, both canine and human, so for that I am a forever fan of Bandfield! I think I can speak for Harley as well."
3,"i don't doubt that many people have bad experiences at this restaurant, because I can see how a lot of the food is overpriced the hosting station seemed to be a little lackluster.  My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer\nMain Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong."
1,"stayed here for my one year anniversary. got to the room and discovered they put us in a room with two queen beds. how romantic...took us about half an hour to get into another room with one bed (what i originally booked for). i really wanted a smoking room and they claimed that they were all out but will be willing to move us to one the next day. great, now i cant smoke for one day in my room and i cant unpack because id have to wake up early pack up all my stuff and check back into another room. we checked later that first night to see what time was best to call them to see what time to check out and call for the new smoking room. they said between 12-3pm. fine. we called them at 1pm the next day and they said to us oh dont worry about it just stay in that same room and u can smoke in it now., we'll just fog it out when ur checked. WTF....couldnt u have just done that the first time??? it wasnt like i just asked once. when we checked in we asked 3 different ppl. when we got to our room with two beds we asked again. we came again that night to check another time. sigh** oh and when im on vacation i enjoy a nice bath since my bathroom at home is only a standing shower. low and behold my bathtubs drain did not stay plugged up to even draw a bath. great. awesome. cool. never again mirage...never again"
4,"I'm on a four to five star review binge, but they're all deserving, and Bunky's is no exception.\n\nCame here on a Saturday at around 3 for an early dinner and the place was dead. The hostess was sweet as pie and informed us that they were switching over to their dinner menu. It's quite large, with a mix between Italian and Mediterranean fare, but was not overwhelming in the slightest.\n\nTo start, we ordered a hummus appetizer, and it was so incredibly good - served with warm pieces of soft, airy and delicious pieces of pita. Ugh, I'm eating some store brand hummus and crackers as I type this, and they've got nothin' on Bunky's.\n\nI set my eyes on one of Bunky's staples: Bunky's Pasta. It's loaded with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, onions and farfalle noodles. It's mixed with the most mouthwatering creamy marinara sauce. The sauce was sweet and the plate savory, and all worked well together to create a cohesive dish.\n\nI know that Bunky's has some funky hours, but please make time to stop in when they're open. You will be glad you did."
2,"Pretty good burger! Good beer selection & happy hour prices. We shared the Juicy Lucy - it was cooked just right and had nice gooey, melty cheese inside that oozed out when we cut into it. We had the tater tots which were really good. Love when they are cooked just right and come out perfectly golden brown and hot and crispy all around. While the quality seemed ok it lacked a bit of flavor. Had to season it pretty good with salt and pepper - but that can go both ways. I do like to season my own food so that wasn't a deal breaker for me. If or when we are back in the area we'd stop in again."
2,It was nicely air conditioned.  The only downfall is lack of seating.  Most of the venues are standing only.  Not too great when you are standing for hours.  I probably would have stayed through the whole concert if I wasn't already standing during the opening act.
3,"Good size store across from the Nike outlet on the corner.  Good selection of shoes for me and women.  Also sells clothes and accessories (hats, belts, backpacks, socks, etc.).   Nice large bench square for trying on shoes.  Pleasant and helpful staff."
3,"I too went to eat my first Cronut.  All they had left was coconut creme filling and guava filling, so I bought them up.  One of the cooks rang me up, and was very knowledgeable and pleasant as we spoke about the finer points of Cronut science.\n\nSo I guess it would make more sense to grade the components separately...\n\nCronut -- A: This was my cheat day, so what feels to be a 3000 calorie bomb tastes every bit as good as a 3000 bomb should.  Heavy, dense, and delicious.  Crunchy on the outside and chewy inside.  The texture and for the most part flavor was like nothing I had experienced before.  The two days it takes to make them is worth it, nice job guys.\n\nFilling -- D-: Real problems here.  First off, the flavor is nice, but very subtle.  I could only taste the coconut and guava when I had it on its own, and it was faint.  You just cannot put something with subtle hints of flavor on a full-flavor bomb like a Cronut.  You'll never taste it.  Second, the texture.  Both fillings had a runny, snotty texture that made an absolute mess all over the place.  Whether you eat it like a Big Mac, or you take it apart piece by piece and eat it that way, you can't escape it going all over the place.  Since it doesn't really taste like much anyway, I took a knife, scraped it off, and STILL managed to get it all over the plate and my fingers.  Magic stuff I tell ya.  For something so delicious, the experience as a whole really suffers because of this.  Such an easy fix, I hope they can figure it out.\n\nI'd definitely be willing to go back in a few months on another cheat day to try a different flavor and see if that makes a difference."
1,"Average manga themed ramen spot in Chinatown Vegas next to Asian restaurants and an AYCE Japanese sushi restaurant and ayce KBBQ place.  I say manga theme because the cute waitresses wear colorful wigs and Japanese cartoon outfits modeled after Anime magazines and the menu has Spicy! and Hot! popping out at you in cartoonish fonts.  That's the biggest draw, though, because the food itself was somewhat bland and it took a long time for it to come out.  I got the miso ramen and split an order of kim chi fried rice and karaage chicken, but my ramen tasted bland and wasn't too exciting.  The chicken was too oily and the meat was dry but crispy.  The fried rice was just ok too but not that memorable.  I don't mean to nitpick, I guess I was expecting some pop out at you flavor and excitement from a cartoon themed restaurant.  I wanted to like it, it's a cute place and the waitresses are really cute.  I suppose a huge anime or video game fan (otaku?)  would be crazy about this place and want to try everything on the menu whenever they were in town.  They also serve boba."
3,This place is really cool. So many birds. The shows were very interesting as well. The food court has some good pizza too.
2,"it's fun to come here at 2 am when other asian restaurants nearby are closed. Food was so so, some hit, some missed. A bit loud with with club music they're playing in the background. The waitresses were very nice and friendly, if it wasn't for them, i would have giving 1 less star."
2,"No. I can NEVER avoid a new Kabob place. Not ever. Frankly, I think I would rather eat a good gyro more than any other meat related sandwich, dish, or anything. I am not Greek. I am not of any mediterranean decent, but I have the Gyro fever and there is no stopping me. \n\nSo naturally I had to stop in when I was in Fremont to get a load of the Kabob Korner and their Super Gyro of course. \n\nIt was a Gyro which is good in my book. It was super if you use the word super kind of sarcastically. Overall it was OK. Really, I am looking for that yogurt sauce and lamb/beef combo to knock my socks off but this super gyro was pretty super normal. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to go back here. Especially for the area it is really convenient to have the best food in the world so close to old town Vegas. Next time I try it I will update this review- I hope my mind will change or I will find that gem that they cook like none other. For now I say it is worth it if you have the time, the budget and the tase for a Gyro that you just can't kick."
4,"Great location, you can bike right up too it...lawn is awesome and well layed out.  Bathrooms and concessions are right there."
2,"After my recent dining experience with Phil's BBQ in San Diego, I just figure not many BBQ places can't be beaten; unless I'm in Kansas City or St. Louis. (Don't plan any ideas with me, please.)\n\nI ran into this place on the northwest part of Las Vegas on Rainbow Blvd. As I parked my \""hooptie\"", I saw a pig picture on the restaurant's logo. Seeing the pig is exactly like looking myself in the mirror. (Except the mirror didn't crack!)\n\nThe pig on the logo and looking at the menu means the restaurant serving only \""Pork\"" ribs. \n\nI was disappointed to read that. So I ordered the St. Louis Rib-n-meat Combo anyway. For $16.99, I get 4 slabs of slow-cooked Pork ribs with another meat choice in which I took the Chicken Tenders. I also get two sides and I took the red skin mashed potatoes and the firecracker green beans. The pork ribs tasted spicy, lean and tender. The chicken tender was nothing to brag about. But the tangy and spicy chipotle dipping sauce adds a nice touch. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and add a mellow garlic taste.  The beans had bacon bits and add a nice crunch. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w?select=ZOBQ6IBGMmxiNrWBWaKfzQ\n\nI also added a tall 23oz glass of Blue Moon beer for $6.00. I love the nutty taste of the cold beer and goes well with my meal. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N4BbeIbQNgtUEEMutu9U3w?select=c5PNlWMVvoiMdIjUKe8PjQ\n\nMike was my waiter and he treated me really well on my needed needs. \n\nPork ribs or Beef ribs? I'll stick with beef. But this place is not bad though."
4,"Best park on the west side of Vegas. I'm here all the time. It's good for younger toddler years also. Very safe. A lot of room and different toys to play on. Seems like it's well run and managed. The architecture, sand pits, and rope climber are all so unique. My daughter loves the snake and lizard statues. There's something for everyone here. AND a water park in the summer."
2,no offense but the waiter or the server should really need to learn that the rice and the curry should be placed into two different boxes to go!
1,"Stopped in for breakfast this morning & didn't care much for the place.  It started with a 10 minute wait in line to pay.  Then it was another 15+ minutes before the food came out.\n\nI ordered a \""Ginormous\"" Breakfast, which it wasn't.  This consisted of 3 eggs, 3 smallish pancakes, 3 small pieces of very salty ham, & some rather dry potato wedges, for $10.\n\nTo me, it wasn't as good as the same priced breakfasts at some of our other choices around town such as Matt's, & I doubt that I will return here again."
2,"Don't let the strip mall location and exterior of Fiamma keep you away; this is a solid choice for good Italian food in Charlotte. Located just off of Park Road, there is plenty of parking as multiple stores share the lot. \n\nArriving slightly early for our reservation, we snagged a spot by the bar for a beverage before eating. The layout of the restaurant is a bit awkward with the smallish bar right in the center, but there were a ton of tables packed into the space. Bathrooms only had one stall each and weren't the cleanest; could use a good scrub and cosmetic updates. \n\nOnce seated, the service was good and the flow of the meal worked for our group of six. A rundown of the food at our table: \n\n-Calamari was a solid appetizer choice, and it even had a few shrimp and zucchini pieces in it, which were also very good. \n-Bread & Pesto Oil was top notch. Bread was very fresh and the oil was absolutely delicious. \n-Caprese salad was a bit below par; tomato wasn't ripe and the balsamic wasn't the best. \n-The Cio Bella pasta dish that I ordered was very good. Others at the table had the sea bass special (which I tried and was delicious), the osso bucco (I was told it was good), the steak (told it was okay) and the veal special (two people ordered - one didn't like at all and the other wasn't cooked through). \n\nUltimately, I think sticking to ordering a pasta dish was a good choice! Due to our long wait, we were offered three free desserts to split (all delicious), which was plenty considering the large portion sizes of our meals. Wine ordered at the bar and the table was very good, and not ridiculously priced per bottle."
4,"I walked over to Ray's when visiting nearby Thunderbird University and ended up telling everyone else at the school to walk over there for lunch!\n\nI ordered two slices of beef & black olives, and kicked back in one of the old-school diner booths to watch the game until my food was ready.\n\nCozy atmosphere, quiet but not too small, with a few small TVs mounted around the place with sports on.  I got two slices & water for about $6.\n\nI got my pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  The slices were large (think bigger than delivery pizza but not too big to hold one handed with a slight bend in the slice).  The beef was not ground beef as I expected, but slices of beef.  The taste was awesome; the beef was more like gyro beef, which lent a great flavor to the pizza.  The crust & bread was thin but soft with a slight crisp at the end.  Perfect.  \n\nIf I had more time, I would have gotten a whole pizza and walked it back.  Definitely a great place to eat if you are in the Glendale area!"
2,"I dont know what they are pumping through their HVAC system, but it is awful. It smells like they are using perfume to cover up the smoke smell and it is just making it worse. Thankfully I am not staying there overnight and I dont think I ever will now."
2,"The salsa here at Nandos was amazing.  I usually make great judgement with the salsa, as I pour a ton of salsa all over my main entrees.  I do not do it because the food lacks flavor, but I do it because I love salsa just that much.  I ordered the Jalapeno Chicken Soup.  I wasn't terribly hungry and I banked on eating a lot of chips and salsa to fill up.  The soup was okay.  I was happy it was white meat chicken, but it lacked some flavor.  I tried some of my friend's rice and beans, and it was a little too salty for my liking.  I will have to give this another try and maybe my ratings might improve a little."
0,"I called a psychic for a phone reading and boy, it was AWFUL. She basically asked my sign and gave generic attributes about it. Not worth the money.\n\nAlso, it felt very much like a \""Psychic Network Hotline.\"" Not personalized or warm at all."
2,I first heard about this place when I saw Hubert Keller on PBS. Was in Vegas and decided to seek the BB out. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was not terribly impressed. My wife's salmon burger was very good but the Angus burger lacked sufficient seasoning. The french fry dipping sauce arrangement was the star of the show (very good). Our son's burger plate was adequate (definately salmonella free).
2,"This was our second time to Au Pied de Cochon, after having an excellent meal the first time. Unfortunately, this time around we were slightly less impressed...the meatloaf, which was one of the specials of the day, was very salty and the staff forgot that it was my boyfriend's birthday, even though I had made a special request when making the reservation and reminded our waiter during the meal.\n\nHaving said that, the food is generally quite tasty and the ambience is lively.  The staff is friendly and professional, but disappointing that they would forget a special occasion, since you would expect more from such a quality establishment."
2,"I went for a lunch dish in the last minute on a Sat. The head chef made our sandwich which was great, but I think 9 dollars is a bit much. I would come back to try dinner, but I was not real excited about the service. Server was not real informative about a business only being open 8 weeks. I had to ask all the questions about the food. They did not come off real friendly. I love the look and the food, but for the price and snob Scottsdale service... not sure."
4,Love this place.  The steak and flank with an over easy egg is the bomb!!  Plus they make great pot stickers!!
4,"Super delayed review but the hubby and I went to Gallagher's last summer during our annual trek to Vegas to celebrate the birthdays. It was during Las Vegas Restaurant week. Hubby tried the Filet Mignon which he really enjoyed, a tender piece and very tasty. I had the rib-eye which had perfect marbling and an out-of-this-world flavor! Both were good size cuts. We shared the Four Cheese Macaroni, Creamed Spinach and Yukon potatoes for sides, all were delish! As tasty as our meals were, the highlight was definitely the service. Our waiter was super attentive, friendly and offered spots to visit whilst in town (though we're not Vegas rookies). We're heading back this summer and will absolutely be returning to Gallaghers!"
2,Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I got the falafel-the pita was very good but the actually falafel balls were very dry.
4,"The BFD isn't Payton Curry. its not the food, either, its the floorshow. Payton and his wife manage to make this tiny space feel cavernous and fabulous. Their banter is hysterical, and Payton somehow manages to hear everything said on the floor from his outpost cooking. The words fly fast, but you'll laugh hysterically. \n\n\nAnd the food? Inventive, fresh, reasonable and fast."
1,"The tram project in Edinburgh! Most people think they will be a good idea, however almost everybody cannot stand the annoyance and delays surrounding the works. \n\nThe tram line is supposed to go from the airport to Leith. However, after only a couple of years, work is slow and progress is at a snail's pace. Last year Princes Street changed remarkably due to the noisy works blocking off cars and buses from the street. Indeed, the west end of the city seems to be undergoing constant works every time you pass it. \n\nI'm sure the trams will be brilliant when they are finished, and Edinburgh will have caught up with other European cities. However one does feel that the money could have been used to improve the already great bus service. I'm sure when they are finished, we will all like the tram system but that I am sure is a long way away."
1,"As others have explained, you avoid fees by having to take a 2nd shuttle from the Consolidated Rental Facility.  At the office you have to sign a statement that you did not arrive from the airport via the rental facility's shuttle.  They obviously are skirting the law. The 2nd problem we encountered is the clerks try very hard to sell you all sorts of unnecessary insurance coverage."
4,Toppings are always fresh. Pizza always good. This is my go-to place to find NY style pizza.
2,"It's a post office. It is probably the hardest post office ON EARTH to find. Well, to be fair, I have been to many post offices here in the U.S. but not world-wide, so it's the hardest post office in the country to find. \n\nIt is too small and covering too much geographical area, aside from the fact that it is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND, so it has many challenges it must face serving so large of a customer base. I buy my own labels, discounted of course, online and package at home (or in the car in a pinch) and therefore don't deal with the line or the TINY counter for people to use to pack their parcels. There is no bin (too small for a bin to be out) for already-paid packages so you just leave it on the counter in the far right after walking through the third set of doors.   \n\nWould it kill them to have some signage so you can see from Decatur or Oakey that a USPS office is here? Apparently it would. I must have driven around (and behind) and around some more this post office for over half an hour looking for it the first time I came here. It is pretty ridiculous. It actually cannot be put into words so I will take a few pictures to let you decide. - E"
0,"WORST CLUB EVER. I love electronic music and this venue has great DJ's but a horrible sound system. The system could not handle the low or high end that is required for electronic music. If you are not getting a table do not go here. I had  FOUR drinks spilled on me and my drink spilled twice. I paid $30 for my ticket and $50 for my husbands during the presale to see Tiesto on March 15, 2014. They over packed the club. If i called the fire marshal they would have shut the club down. If there was a fire everyone would have died. I did not even stay to see Tiesto due to the overcrowding and lack of view. The wait at the bar was not even worth it for a watered down drink....just to be spilled. \n\nI WOULD NEVER GO HERE AGAIN AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLUB TO ANYONE."
4,"My husband and I ate here before seeing 'Book of Mormon'.  Everything was great - food, service, etc.  We don't eat out often at nice places anymore, so it was a relief to have a good experience that was worth the money.\n\nWe tried the lobster bisque,homemade ravioli (I ordered the plain cheese, old-school version because I knew it would be good), osso buco (my husband always orders this if it's on a menu), and Chilean seabass (this used to be my go-to dish but since it's now overfished and politically incorrect I try to abstain).  Accompanying risotto was good.  My only complaint was that there were no veggies on the plates (although you could order spinach as a separate side).  Maybe restaurants have moved away from this because people don't eat them and they go to waste.\n\nI highly recommend Luce for an excellent pre-show dinner."
1,"Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy (our first clue we \nProbably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!"
0,"I work at an Outback in Westminster, CA and was in Vegas with some coworkers when we decided to check out what Vegas's Outback had to offer. To say we were disappointed would be a huge understatement. The food was great, just what we're used to, but the service was awful. Or at least our server was. Joshua seemed to have write us off immediately. We hadn't even ordered drinks and he already seemed to hate us. He was completely rude and unattentive throughout our meal. We all work in a restaraunt and were willing to understand that everyone has rough nights but then another one of his tables were seated right next to us and were quickly greeted with a smile and friendly conversation. To put it simply, we were confused. In the end, he didn't get the best tip and we concluded that he had discriminated against us because of our age range. He was too quick to assume that we were just young kids drunk in Vegas. We knew we were right when we saw the surprise and regret on his face when we informed him that we all work at Outback. Anyways, if you're planning on going here and are seated with Joshua, I suggest you request another server."
1,"I'm giving this location 2 stars, soley for its convenient location. Otherwise it would have been 1. \nMy wife and I go specifically for the Goya products, and tortillas. \nWell, on Saturday she goes and finds they were having deals on other items, and ended up spending $53.88. \nShe gets home, starts cooking, and realizes the very specific bottle of seasoning, which she went there to get in the first place, was Not among the other groceries. Also missing was a jalape\u00f1o pepper. \nNo worries, just a mile down the street.\nWhen she gets there, with receipt in hand, she explains the situation to the store mgr.  Well, apparently, a missing $0.88 jalape\u00f1o, and an almost $3 bottle of seasoning, is not to be taken lightly. The manager went \""straight to the video tape!\"". Questioned the cashier, and bagger (who both said she took them with her), and then argued with my wife that she was wrong/mistaken. \nWe're maybe talking $5, at the very most, of items off of a grocery bill, which cost over $50.  \nTook her almost 15-20 mins of disputing with the guy, until they finally compensated her.\nGeez......that's just really bad customer service."
4,"Two awesome places in one!  Rockin' unique vintage on one side of the store and on the other a great salon!  Annie in the salon is a master in her craft.  I've followed her for years now and it's awesome that she was able to open such a visionary store.  Her services are top notch.  She specializes in color but is awesome at haircuts, blow-outs and even the updo for your big day! There are lots of interesting, and rare vintage pieces, not to mention the up and coming pieces from local artists that are showcased every month.  That alone is reason enough to stop in and see what's new (or old)!"
3,"Nice Indian place hidden atop hill on Greentree. Food was good as expected of a good Indian restaurant. Had the Chicken Sangrilla, Lamb Korma, and Kheema Naan ...all were great."
0,"Let me say this up front:  I **LOVE** Chipotle.  I eat it at home, I eat it on the road for business.  Sometimes I will eat it twice a day.  I've eaten the \""secret menu\"" items like the fabled quesorito.  I've eaten it all over the country -- after Chick Fil A, it is hands-down my favorite fast food/fast casual concept.\n\nThat being said ... this is unquestionably the worst-managed Chipotle I've ever been to (and lucky me, it's my neighborhood store).\n\nHow on earth can they be out of ingredients so often??  And I'm not talking like \""hey, do you happen to have cilantro for that?\""  No, this is like \""sorry, we are out of chicken.\""  WHAT!?!  CHICKEN!?!\n\nAnd not just once.  This has happened multiple times.  Tonight it was barbacoa and mild salsa.  Seriously ... \""we are out of mild salsa.\""  Said no Mexican restaurant, ever.  Except Chipotle-Matthews.\n\nThis place is perpetually understaffed, and it makes me want to not come here because they have done the unthinkable and ruined a near-perfect product that requires all the brain power of pushing a button on a copy machine to get me to a point of perfect customer satisfaction.\n\nZero stars, @$$ clowns.  ZERO."
4,"Spirit filled church; outstanding music.  The easiest (and not anywhere close to the whole story) description would be \""Pentacostal Lite\"".  You're not going to see snakes or much in the way of speaking in tongues but if you are interested in a Church where Jesus is the center focus and worship is an active experience then this is the place for you.  Our family took a long time getting to visit here, but after going to many of the placid, dried up services at other places, we found this to be home.  Loran Livingston is Senior Pastor and gifted teacher/speaker/minister.  The choir and musicians are world class and passionate performers."
0,"I would like give a positive review. So, initially I will. There are a couple of service writers I enjoy very much. They are Kangaroo Bob and the gentleman sitting next him. His name escapes me at the moment, but he's the good looking mate, who is also very charismatic. The opposite of Bob. I would also like to recommend Ryan Bostein, in sales. Ryan is competent and knows Mini's well. If you have to buy a Mini in Las Vegas, I recommend Ryan. He can be reached at 702-985-8650. \n\nNow, the negative portion of this review. The service manager is an idiot. He lies, he is incompetent, and he insulted my girlfriend and me. And he isn't very keen with arithmetic. He thinks he knows everything. I don't believe that to be the case. In fact, I know at least a dozen people who share my opinion.\n\nBrandon Busse, the general manager of Mini Las Vegas, hasn't been much help either. I have called him four (4) times in the last month. He has called me once. And I stopped in to see him. Nothing. \n\nMy Mini will never be serviced at Las Vegas Mini again. You are such a bitter disappointment."
2,"Rumblin' Tums is your classic greasy spoon, but it just so happens that I like greasy spoons!  They provide fresh morning rolls, surprisingle gorgeous bran scones and service with a smile!  And the decor inside is clean and fresh, all I'm looking for in a wee cafe!\n\nThe outside could do with a lick of paint and the tables and chairs have seen better days, but all in all it fills its purpose.  Perfect for a wee brew off a sunny afternoon!"
1,"Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!"
2,"The hotel itself is beautiful! The rooms are also very nice. The Villas are OUT OF SIGHT amazing. I was at a bondage party here in 2010 after the last night of the AVN Awards.\n\nFew things here.. Security at the elevators is very tight 24/7. It's nearly impossible for a girl to even charisma check her way past them. You WILL need to rendezvous with your provider somewhere on the grounds.\n\nAlso the Valet is a total cluster as it runs into the palazzo and meanders under bridges and around faux-venetian canals. \n\nPlease note the 3-Star rating is based solely on a man's ability to enjoy himself with a consenting adult who is not staying in the hotel, not on the merits of the hotel itself which is, truthfully, breath-taking."
2,"Finally headed to Greek Isles after living within walking distance for years. Definitely a family-run place and you can tell by the regulars that they take care of their customers time after time.\n\nStarted with the flaming cheese, and like most have mentioned, was really good and starts the meal off with a flame! :) I ordered the spanakopita (huge portion) which is one of my favorite Greek dishes. I also tried the wife's gyro and it was really good! For dessert we tried the lemon custard cake (description not exact) and it was disappointing, but oh well.\n\nThe service was excellent and all in all; a solid 3 for me. I'll definitely be back for a gyro!"
1,"Great atmosphere, awesome drinks but food was horrible. We had the rice balls which were still cold inside, the chicken ravioli and veal parm which both tasted like they could have been at Olive Garden. Even the bread pudding was bad. I would go back for a drink but that's it."
2,"Six guys without reservations on Cinco de Mayo FIght weekend looking for a good meal found this place pretty empty at around 7.30pm.  three of us joined up late and our waiter promptly took our drink orders and promptly forgot them.  after our drinks showed, we ordered the baked brie for around $11 and the crabcakes $9 i think.  the waiter was very pushy insisting that we orer multiples of every appetizer.  we ordered more beer.  my friend was so pissed that his was taking so long to show that he ordered two beers at once to make sure he would get at least one.\n  the filet mignon at $23 was reasonable but i asked for mine memdiim rare, and not a drop of blood came out of it.  the asparagus was cooked well, all six sprigs of it, and the mashed potatoes that were squeezed out of a pastry bag looked pretty but were too dry and lacked seasoning.\n  overall a bargain, but definitely felt like i was paying less for less, but then again, everything else was stocked, so it was better than starving.  we left and headed straight over to the SPEED ride to give our stomachs some excitement."
0,"My family & I go out to eat every  Friday,Saturday, & Sunday. I don't think we have ever had such horrible service. We sat at the table for 10 minutes not one person took our drinks or even greeted us. All the employees just looked at our table nobody ever came. When we finally got up to leave some of the employees said bye thank you. \nWorst service ever."
2,Was aight... For Americanized Asian food.. I had the schezwan spicy beef noodle soup. My friend had the seafood noodle soup which she thought was ok too.  \n\nFor a restaurant in the Aria that's trying to cater to most of the asians who come to Vegas to gamble and party.. its an easy and quick alternative to getting a cab and going to the chinatown area of Las Vegas.\n\nThis is also one of the restaurants that is included in the list of comped restaurants in the Aria.
4,"What a nice place to hang out. Their remodels reduced none of the charm, and improved their service. Do yourself a favor and camp out when you go; it's comfy like a couch."
1,"Wow, I just don't understand the buzz about this place at all. First off there was 2 things I just couldn't get over, how dirty and worn down the inside was and how bad the service was. The place had been other restaurants before and other than some cheesy Greek mural nothing was done. The table I was at felt like it had never been scrubbed and the benches and chairs are worn out.\n\nThe service was inexcusably bad, and the waitress didn't wash her hands. I know this because I followed her through the front door and never saw her wash her hands. At least until after she brought drinks she was never out of sight. She was also not very knowledgable of the menu, I asked \""what is in your Greek salad?\"" And she says generic 'you know, lettuce and feta cheese and stuff' and then launches into an explanation of feta cheese. I had to ask her 2 more times before I could even get a real answer. She never offered up any specials, but when asked she told us, but one in particular was a \""beef casserole\"" and \""they put seasonings in it to be delicious\"" but nothing more. Ugh she was just lousy, had no table presence and did not own her role in the customer-server relationship. \n\nThe food was...eh, ok. Barely. Nothing tasted fresh at all.  It is still the summer and the tomatoes were lousy. The tzatziki sauce was just yogurt, no pepper or cucumber was discernible. The pita was tasteless and closing in on stale. The lamb meat was so overwhelmingly seasoned with oregano and something else I couldn't taste the lamb, but at least it was hot.  And the \""Greek fries\"" were a joke. You can't sprinkle a minuscule amount of dried oregano on fries and call them Greek. \n\nOh and the kids meals were a let down. A healthy pile of meat on a pita, no sauce, no tomato, nothing. Nobody wants a dry gyro, not even kids.\n\n2 stars instead if 1 for 2 reasons. Even though the kids meal gyro was lousy it was still a great value and once we got some sauce they were edible. And the gyro meat. Granted it was over-spiced but it was still yummy with a deliciously browned outside."
4,Great place!! Amazing food and service! We will definitely be back for more. Great bar and atmosphere also. Must check it out
4,Great!  Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Staff is extremely courteous.  Try the jade chow mien and salt and pepper pork.
3,"One of my new favourite shawarma places (and places I get most excited for when visiting Montreal).  The shawarma meat is very well seasoned and tender.  They get it absolutely spot on.  The sides are quite good too.  We came here once with a large group and the owner came out and greeted us and gave us complimentary dates, which was very nice.\nDon't know if it was an accident, but the last time I went, there was very little meat on my plate, which was a disappointment."
1,"Thank you for the friendly service! But the food was too sweet for me and never really did it for me. I'm willing to try it again, based on it's close location, but I will hope for a spicier experience."
0,Not good. Just not good. From service to food it leaves a lot to be desired.
3,"I love Harlow's. It's nice to come back to to the ASU area and see that one of my old fave's is still around. \n\nThe Eggs Benedict are so good. I get them EVERY TIME. I have yet to try anything different here. And because I am such a loyal person, I can pretty much assure you that I will probably never try anything else. \n\nIt's pretty much always crowded so be prepared to wait. Not too long though. I think the longest I've ever waited is 15 minutes, which is reasonable. But you'll be served in no time after ordering. \n\nI'm not a huge breakfast person and I currently live at least 20 miles from Harlow's, but will still come here from time to time to enjoy a great breakfast and great service."
4,"Possibly the best name for a shop ever, Rotato delivers what it promises - potatoes cooked while rotating slowly on a spit roast. (See what they did there?). Located so close to the university its silly, Rotato is a fairly new place hidden away under a cafe - but dont be put off by this. When I first entered Rotato I was shocked - I had been expecting a small, dark counter and not much more. Instead I found a modern eating area, bar type service area and beautiful furnishings. Stunning. Of course, you can take out as well, but I'm not sure you would want to!\n\nI really cannot give any higher praises for this place-. The potatoes are cooked to perfection - crispy on the outside and fluffy and light on the inside - just how a baked potato should be, but so few places manage to get it right.\n\nRotato admittedly, have one downfall - it only has a selection of 7 fillings for your potatoes, but these fillings are simply sublime - well thought out, stunningly tasty and sometimes even odd combinations that work so well its a suprise you have never though of it before. There are being new fillings added to the menu all the time, but the ones that are available now are absolutly perfect. Having tried the entire menu now, I would suggest going for the adventurous sounding 'Aussie Mongrel' - chilli, coleslaw, cheese and sour cream. Mmmmmm.\n\nI love this place, I really do, and I wish that Yelp could give some sort of extra special sixth star - this place deserves it!"
0,"This place is a joke. \nCame in with my sister and we told them exactly what we needed, she wanted a pedicure and I wanted a full set and polish change on my toes. \nThe guy told us as soon as she was done with the polish change, he would start my full set because we had to be out by a certain time. \nOnce my polish change is done, a new lady comes in and wants a manicure, so the guy takes her and leaves me waiting! Mind you, my sister has been soaking her feet now for the past 20 minutes. We ask them what their plan is for our nails and they tell us to just come back later. At this point we made it clear unless they did what they said they would do, we wouldn't be coming back. \nThe lady was laughing and apologizing, and then wants $10 for my polish change. Fine. So I pull up the 10% off coupon and she asks, \""you really want 10% off of 10$? That's only a dollar\"" of course I want to use it since I won't be back! \nI had $8 cash for a tip, and she rang me up at $9. So I gave her my credit card. \""Oh, you don't have cash? I can't run this, has to be a certain amount haha\"" \nThen the guy says it's company policy to have a charge be at least $15, but he'll run it for me today. Bullsh*t. I should've just left without paying. Avoid this place and their awful service!"
2,"**1st stop of the Nite Tours event, so front of the line entry and no cover.\n\nThe Bank really does exist in Vegas?  Here I was, thinking it was just the name of Al Pacino's hotel in Ocean's Thirteen.  The real question is - where is the room inside The Bank with all of those Five Diamond awards?  ;)\n\nCompared to the handful of clubs I've been to in Vegas, The Bank ranks as one of the smaller ones.  After you make your way upstairs, they have a walkway that rings the outside of the club with two bars on opposing walls.  A tier below, there's a cordoned off section of tables, with another section right below that which circles their small-ish dance floor.  While it was cramped being out there dancing, at least there were brief moments where you had a bit of space.  However, it didn't help whenever the workers for the table service would plow their way through.\n\nAs for the rest of our experience, it was mixed.  The crowd was fairly mixed, but definitely a little older than places like XS, Tao, and Marquee and the DJ spinning was just okay.  I liked the lighting effects and how they had smoke jets and foam machines above the dance floor, but the dance floor itself is just so small.    \n\nWhile The Bank didn't necessarily have any fatal flaws, it didn't offer much that stood out either.  At least we walked away with one highlight for the night - running into Coolio and taking some pictures with him.  Too bad his celebrity status peaked over a decade ago though..."
2,This club was super nice inside. They played some pretty cool music all night and it was super crowded. It was rev run's birthday party night here and omg this place was super super crowded like dang can a girl walk through without getting bumped and shoved! Well my friends and I had a pretty good time here at club Tao!!!
0,"I've eaten here 3 times and I kick myself for going back the other 2 times. The first time it was terrible. It was fish and chips and there was nothing but heavy batter, you had a hard time finding the fish, it must have been thin as a sheet of paper. But I gave it a second chance, figuring it might have been a bad day for the cook. So this time a got adventurous and had a rib-eye steak. What a disaster, it was cooked dry, so overly done I couldn't cut it with a knife. I asked for medium-rare. So, convinced I would not ever go back, until my neighbor begged me to go with her and again, terrible food. This place I would never recommend to anyone and I made it very clear to my neighbor I would not be returning."
2,"It's OK, I'm not going to go out of my way raving about it, but it was definitely better than Strip Burger.  At least this seems like hand pressed beef, where Stip Burger uses the preformed SYSCO patties.  The bar for me is The Great Grille from Burbank, unfortunately they are long closed due to the owner passing.  If you have your choice, go to In-N-Out or Tommys!  $40 for two including shakes, a soda, and twofer or whatever it was.  The basket of fries and rings."
3,"Second go-round at Black Bear Diner involved my husband and his cousin along with her boyfriend. The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.\n\nThe restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.\n\nI was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99\n\nMy order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty. \n\nThe only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!\n\nI'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well."
0,Have been using this service for a month. Each weekend my family would go out to use the pool the floor of the pool would not be clean and would be cloudy if used. Having a party planned for this weekend so I called to simply ask if it could be for sure cleaned up for the weekend and I was given major attitude. Not once was I rude to this guy and he snapped at me for no reason. He stated he doesn't like to be told he is not doing his job and that he would terminate my service so I could find someone who could clean my pool. I would not recommend anyone use his service due to his bad attitude and bad service.
1,"I've been jonesing to play bingo since moving here so we checked out Fort McDowell last night. We got there 45 minutes before the games started & the place was completely packed - with a line 30 people deep to buy in. Apparently you have to get a player's card or else you'll only get 1/4 of the winnings. I was not interested in that nonsense. I was also not interested in standing in line for 30 minutes to sit in a smokey room. People take bingo here seriously - which is awesome, but I don't, so I felt strange. I don't have a mini back pack full of dobbers & come 2 hours early to secure 'my spot' in the bingo hall. We took a look around, looked at each other, headed out & got ice cream instead."
3,"We stopped by Wolfgang after walking out of another place.  We were glad we chooses Wolfgang.  Great service, excellent food.  Good call before the show we were going to see later that night"
4,"My girlfriend and I love this Whole Foods! It is bigger with a bigger selection than the one in Tempe. The cafe area and the deli area is huge. The employees are nice, it seems to have more products and it is hard to choose which ones you want because it's all organic!\n\nThe problem is it is expensive, but I would pay more if I had the money and I do believe in good quality products within a reasonable price. We usually go there if we stay in Phoenix and not go to Tempe."
2,"Not very impressive on first view, but clean, comfortable and reasonably priced.  We stayed there three nights and would recommend it.\nThe \""Continental Breakfast\"" was a joke - not-too-fresh bagels with cream cheese and jellies, weak coffee and a nice choice of teas and hot chocolate.  \nOther than that, not bad at all - especially for Gila Bend."
1,"Disappointed!  From the Yelp rating and the looks of the place I thought it was a diamond in the rough.  This could be my neighborhood go-to pizza joint, I thought!  There were some questionable comments in the reviews but I thought maybe if I get the carryout, it is better than the slices served there?\n\nThe pizza was underwhelming.  Although the toppings were good, sauce and crust was ok, it was very much like a homemade copycat version of Tombstone pizza.  However, at 2.50 vs 18 per pie, might as well stock up on the frozen version.\n\nThe chicken wings were pretty soggy and had lots of thick skin on it.  If you like that kind of thing, go for it.  Me, I would rather not.\n\nI wish I could have liked it a little better, they seemed very nice and I like local businesses.  :/"
1,"Great location, amazing customer service! ...unfortunately the food is below average and tasteless! I love Paradise Bakery and hoped to find something similar in the area...I was very disappointed."
3,"Always have had friendly service here, both when we played Tuesday night Team Bingo (and it was busy) and when I stopped in for a Bills game (also busy).  Food is good, bathrooms and clean and they have an outdoor patio. Plus I can pay for my beer with my Bingo winnings! Can't  beat it."
3,So far so good ! I personally did not eat it..I bought a Nutella cake for my friend for her bday ...we were in town for tears for fears this past weekend and it was her bday too...hello bday needs cake lolol....I bought a napoleon slice for my mother in la ....I drove it back and was eaten the next day my mother who is critical of everything said it was goood!!! Lolol I said it better be it was pricey. ..my bday girl friend said it was good too. Tho I didn't see her eat it ...would be back :-)
0,"Enrique.P\n\nAround mid February we adopted a small dog from spca, we were told that the dog was healthy with no problems? 2 days later we discovered that the dog was not Eating? She had teeth hanging from her upper jaw\nSpca told us that they will help with the $600 surgical cost over the phone. We took the dog back and we were told that we are not getting her back, they will conduct and investigation? And the adoption fee could go for the surgery cost? I Want my dog back!!! The rude lady behind the counter needs a little training in customer service and courtesy this is a service town not Salem......,"
0,"Not the best.  Doctors, nurses, receptionists are not very personable.  Took my son here recently for baby well check up, don't think I'll be coming back.  Nurse stabbed shots into my baby's leg like it was raw meat.  My old pediatrician's nurse would never have given shots like that."
2,"Refreshing drinks and friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable service.The food is anticlimactic exccept for the chimichurri served with the bread. I got the skirt steak which was pretty much flavorless not to mention tiny.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun though and after dinner there is dancing. More delicious drinks while burning off the boring food!"
2,I like this place for some reason.  Cheap food and cheap room.  Thats all you need.  And also the fun zone downstairs is great for hours.  Pool sucks but this hotel is always fun.
2,"What can I say? It's just a Jack in the Box. Some times referred to as Jack in the Crack. It has the same exact menu and taste as all their other convenient locations. I go to Jack in the Box when I am broke and I usually order the 2 tacos for 99 vents and a jumbo jack. That's a nice meal for under 5 bucks! I love the tacos even after finding out the mysterious meat in the tacos was actually soy. Put some of their strange taco sauce on it and it taste like food to me.\nThis location is strange. There are some hours when the restaraunt is full of tourist getting a bite. Then early mornings and odd hours of the day it becomes a homeless hangout. With a dollar menu anyone can get enough change to get a item and hang out and eat. That is the time I use the drive thru. Be cautious when exiting the drive thru roll up your window. I have been trapped trying to get out to the road with someone begging for the tacos I just ordered. \nThe service is excellent. Everyone is friendly and they always have at least one person working that speaks good English. They are fast and always have smile.\nIf you happen to be hungry and you are in the area, be assured that you will have the same Experience here that you would have at any other Crap in the Box!"
1,Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.
2,Doesn't offer the all you can eat prime rib as of end of august.\nHowever there is enough on the single order to satisfy the average person.
0,"Horrible experience.\n\nWe ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken.\n\nThe Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.\n\nWe told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.\n\nNo Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab. \n\nBad customer service as far as I'm concerned. \n\nTip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills"
1,Really dark. Very hard to see in this place. Funny part was every guest asked if they made sushi. Lol. Food was ok. I had the curry but it was more like a gravy and not curry sauce. Also had pad Thai which was good but way too too much sauce.
4,I think this is the best comic book store I've ever been to.  The people who work there are into what they sell and are all very helpful.
2,"They have fries?!\n\nI pose this question because of the pictures I saw on Yelp; I got ruffles on the side with my order.\n\nAnyway, El Guero is a nice little Torta shop that does have a pretty decent torta. I got the Cuban and it was really good. I didn't see anything on the menu that really stood out to me though besides the Cuban. The conchinita won one of the best sandwiches in Phoenix Magazine in the past, so I will be back to try it eventually. But, with some tough competition in town, it's hard to say when I'll be making it back."
3,"My husband and I joined here several months ago and I have to say we love it. The facility has everything and more one would want from a gym. I love that it is light and airy and is cleaner than other gyms I checked out when searching for a new fitness facility. Classes are good but we have not taken advantage of them all. I like the aqua fitness, especially during the spring and summer when they hold classes outside."
2,just okay. sweetbread and octopus appetizers tasty but small portions. my spouse ordered the duck as a main course and it was very tasty but came without any side\ndish. my rib steak was okay but not prime (we eat better ones at home). it came with\none half of a two inch potato. we skipped dessert. service was good but there were\njust two couples (including us) in the premises.
2,Atmosphere typical of PF which I'm okay with! Wasn't too busy this day and noise was at a low level. Service was fast and friendly. Brown rice a bit dry. Shrimp n lobster sauce was okay! I was hungry or may have given one less star!
4,"Yummy food and really cool vibe! Loved the sashimi tuna tacos, flatbread and brussel sprouts! Our server Alex was EXCELLENT! She knew the menu very well and was extremely patient while trying to accommodate our friends buttery Chardonnay request! Can't wait to go back! But it would have been nice to have more Chardonnay options by the glass"
1,"I wanted to give this place 1 star. BUT the woman cut my sons hair fine. The reason I'm so disgusted is the filthy toys in the wait area. I took a baby wipe to the twisty bead toy(whatever they are called) and wow! Must be years of filth caked on! Now I get that \""they don't pay me enough to do this\"" attitude. BUT as a parent id rather they take the toys out all together. If they aren't paid enough to do it, take them out. So grossed out that is the last time I take my boys there. And let's be honest about everything while were reviewing. The woman had chip on her shoulder cutting my sons hair. The only reason I didn't confront them in person is because I have yelp. FAR MORE POWERFUL."
2,"Came here with a big group of 16 people and 2 kids. Service was pretty good for a large party...and maybe because we also had a high roller at our table. lol. \n\nAnyway, food was okay. Nothing too special. I got the ribeye, which was really plain, but presentation was nice. The best thing on that dish was the potato wedges smashed together covered in spinach. My bf got the chicken, which again was really plain/tasteless alone. My dad got the prime roast and again it was flavorless. If you use the sauce it was really salty, there was no perfect balance. My friend got the salmon, which was cooked right, the only thing cooked right and not plain. The skin was nice and crunchy too. I don't think every one really loved their food. It was okay. \nI think I'd prefer a buffet... variety! \n\nBut this place is good for their selection of beers and drinks! Big place, was able to accommodate us last minute."
4,"A delicious breath of fresh air just off the craziness of the strip. Their breakfast is really good, and for a great price. Greek Omelette was huge and filled with lots of feta! Their French toast is thick and cinnamony! Everyone was really friendly and the service was terrific."
2,At least the prices are good because the parking sucks & employees aren't very helpful.
2,"I enjoyed a nice spring day in Scottsdale at the patio of Stingray Sushi.  I have to say the ambiance of the restaurant fit well with the feeling I had that day.  The unagi and tuna sashimis were excellent.  The one problem I had is that the entire time our waitress didn't realize that we didn't have the little dipping square for our soy sauce and wasabi.  I was waiting the entire time to see if they would notice, but I let it go and compensated by using my plate for my soy sauce.  I didn't really care, but I was curious to see if they would even notice or offer it.  It wasn't even a busy service, so I give a star less than I would normally give for lack of attention."
4,You know how some places don't give a crap about you?\nThis is not the place!\nEvery time I go in I have a good time!\nGO!
3,"I feel the need to give this place a review.  I go here about once a week for lunch, for the past year.  Great Italian beef!  I usually get that, with the fresh-cut on-the-spot fries and a drink and it's like 9 bucks.  Get it with provolone and hot peppers.  I haven't tried their dogs, but they look good and lots of folks order them.  Eat at Jimmy's and make your mouth happy!"
0,"This place is to be completed avoided. I wish I can give it negative stars..  It went from bad to worse in a blink of an eye... The only thing that was utterly FANTASTIC was a clementine-champagne frozen drink (which shouldn't even be considered a drink but a sip). Besides that, everything was completely forgettable. Given the opportunity to go back knowing what I know, I wouldn't go back even if someone PAID me.\n\nThe \""order\"" of the night was an entree of foie gras, main plate of salmon and beef tartar and dessert. The entree and main dish took us over 2 and a half hours to receive. I wasn't aware that was a normal delay. \n\nLet me elaborate as to how the girls-date-night went out the window and we finally just walked out...\nReservations were at 8pm. Got there on time, seated instantly. Then waited for exactly one hour before our entree got to our table (to which another table came in, was seated and served 2 orders before we got our first). Our main meal came about 45 minutes after. At this point, we are contemplating leaving. I'm sorry but is it normal to get 2 plates in about 2 hours..?? \nOn top of the horribly slow service, one of the waitresses was having a GREAT time with her boyfriend (while she was on the job); sitting on his lap, giving him \""affection\"" and having drinks. Funny how she can have HER drinks but we can't get OUR food.\nAfter over 2.5 hours, we finally decided to leave. YOu know, for RAW food, it seemed like a long time to wait. Unless the chef is outside FISHING for the salmon and HEARDING the cows, I don't see why it would take this long. And not to mention that we didn't get all of our plates! We gave up on dessert!! \n\nOur waitress finally came to see us and inquire as to what was wrong (she saw us leaving our table). When briefly advised of what our sentiments were, her only response was \""The kitchen is backed up\"". Funny though, the table of 6 that walked in after us and got served before us seemed to be getting everything in a timely manner. Once being brought our bill, the waitress hovered over us like a hawk until we paid our bill. That was definitely awkward. \n\nAfter this whole disasterous evening, to top everything off, my girlfriend was so intensely sick we didn't know what to do. So if you want to pay money for  a stressful evening with horrible service, this is definitely the place to be."
0,Geeze... Empty as can be and I still got crappy service. Well... I would prefer crappy over non existent which is what we got. I gave them another minute before I was just going to walk out ... Waitress finally came with 15 seconds to spare. Very very unacceptable. FYI still haven't got our water yet either. Avoid this place unless you want to leave by retirement age.
0,"Went there two times...totally disappointed. Super over price, food sucks especially the sushi, not many choices...totally dun worth $35 per person! Dun go here... go wicked spoon at cosmopolitan. Brunch only $22. Nice place, good food, many choices."
0,"I am sooooo upset with PRS. Its not right what renters do with your deposit . We all know that they will find anything to keep your money, but this is ridiculous. And I will not shut up Im going to the news, every review website, write my congress man about this unfair practice. When I moved out the house was 99% perfect. All I missed was LIGHT BULBS. They charged me $70 dollars for 50cent light bulbs. They said everything was good on the phone and then I get the check which was 35% of my deposit.   We gave them slake when they took a year to fix the garage door and then they fix it when we move out. Why couldn't you give us a break?"
1,"I would give this \""Urban Grocery\"" a better rating if their hours were better!  Being closed on Sunday and Monday, two of the most common \""oops, I forgot something and need to go to the grocery store\"" days, is not the best idea.  It's great that this place is within walking distance of our home, but their stock just isn't that great.  I'm glad that I can get Hickman's eggs there, but I wish that they used Superstition Farm milk instead of the ubiquitous Shamrock.  SuperFarm's milk tastes better and lasts longer.  They have an interesting selection of produce, and I realize it's still growing, but we live in AZ so stuff like berries are not to be expected.  Bummer.  They carry some stuff that I will purchase every so now and then like the AZ Cheesecake Co. treats and the bread from Scottsdale, but that's about it."
0,"I've been to this cafe rio several times and although the food isn't great, it's a closer drive than the cafe rio on Stephanie. Most times, their rice is hard, beans are undercooked or just look like they have been sitting out for days. Even the area where they make the food looks super unsanitary. Today I waited 30 minutes in line only to get to order and find out they're out of pork and chicken. If you're going to be out of something, you should at least tell the people waiting in line! I wouldn't suggest this location. I'd rather take the drive for better food and service."
2,"Although our piza and salad was delightful, we had the Pear and Walnut salad and the Pizza Napoli, the staff was kind of smug and unfriendly!!\n\nWe called before going, at 8:45pm, to see how late they served and were told 10pm.  We arrived at 9:35.  The girl said, \""you know we close at 10 right?\""  We told her we would eat quickly.  She replied, \""I have to mop the floor, but we have a big party back there so you should be alright\"".  I found this a very unpleasant way to begin our visit here.  I mean it wasn't like we walked in a 9:55 and expected 5 star service.  After all, it is only pizza and salad.  Anyway, I let it slide.\n\nThen, when the guy brought us our pizza, I had noticed a \""New Times, Best Pizza Winner\"" sign, so I asked him if they had won this year.  He smugly said, \""Oh, I'm sure several years\"".  I thought that was a crappy way to answer my question, since I am very familiar with these awards and didn't remeber them winning ever.  Apparently they one the reader's poll once back in 2007.  Whatever.  I might go back cuz the salad was bomb."
1,"This restaurant has been one of my favorites for several years. But the last two visits have been disappointing. My favorite meal is the House Salad with Salmon. The Salmon is always cooked perfectly. Moist, not over or underdone. But the salad has gotten below what is advertised. The lettuce is not a mixed green mix, it is just large, old romaine lettuce, in big unappetizing chunks. \n\nOn my last visit, there were no tomatoes or cranberries in the salad . A HUGE disappointment!! as this was one of the really special parts of this salad.\n\nI really hate to watch a restaurant compromise quality, especially when they have already increased the price ( although not a lot).  Sadly, Boneheads is no longer at the top of my list."
4,"Just happen to be going for a show and decided to reserve table at Orange Sky.  I had been there several times before to sit in one of the private booths overlooking the city which I highly recommend especially for special occasions.  This time however ate out in main area...Christopher was our waiter and he did a great job serving us.  I usually have fish, but Christopher recommended the fillet and boy was I glad he did!!!  It was way better than the steak I had only a few weekends ago at Dominick's Steak house and about half the price.  This steak melt in your mouth...\n\nI am a local Realtor in town and clients always ask me where to go...now I will replace Dominick's with Orange Sky.  Two thumbs up for Christopher as well, we will request  you in near future as I am already thinking about how good it was!!!"
1,"I can give the food the second chance. However, I still find it unpleasant to be served by half-naked girls in the middle of the day. I am not a conservative and very attractive female who fells free wearing mini dresses and shorts. But, I absolutely find it inappropriate to get food from someone who barely covered. Where is the hygiene? Additionally, there are many other ways to present sexuality (if this is the policy of the place), mature ways that will attract different customers. Place lacks friendly smiling  personal, good selection of beer (Miller, Budweiser and etc topped by one or two local breweries choices). If you want attract customers who value good food, drinks, and service, you need to change some things around. Until then, I will think about ElHefe as a place where people come to get drunk by drinking shitty beer or poor quality drinks at high prices and look at booties! I may be rough with the way I wrote. I very seldom give negative reviews. In this case, I was highly disappointed by the place"
3,"How could I have missed reviewing Goyemon?!?!\n\nThis place really is a secret hot spot. Definitely popular among the locals. It get packed, so arrive early and preferably during non rush hours. The wait can be killer. \n\nGoyemon has fresh sushi and great ingredients. Before eating at Goyemon, I was not a fan of Uni (sea urchin) because of the texture and flavor. Little did I know what great uni tasted like. I'm a believer. As far as their sushi goes, I'm a fan. \n\nI would recommend trying their all you can eat.Know what you want, don't be afraid to try their specials of the day. It's hard to go wrong at Goyemon. I haven't had a dish that I was not fond of. Pick what you like, highly likely you'll enjoy it.\n\nBe forewarned, their service can be a little on the slow side, but you can compensate for that by ordering a lot when they take your first order, that way you won't be like that Brian B. guy who left a stupid ass comment on this great sushi house. If I took 22 people to Sushi Sasabune, I would get horrible service too. Moron. Next time go to Todai or something."
3,"I love the chicken wings, spicy eggplant with pork,  & the crab fried rice, We didnt like the Pomfret fish with spicy curry sauce. The salad dressing was yummy, a creamy orange dressing. The Tom Ka soup was delicious.  Here is a HUGE tip, you have to go here during weekday lunch only or whenever the best cook is there, her name is NANCY."
3,"Oh Yeah is a fantastic place to fulfill your sweet tooth - waffles and ice cream. When you walk in there is a blackboard with all of their available flavors which ranges from your ordinary of  m and ms, nuts and so on to your more eclectic of electricity and wasabi. So really anything you're craving I'm sure you'll find it here. It is ridiculous how many options there are. They get their ice cream from Dave and Andy's which is a favorite local creamery and a plus too - I'm all for supporting small businesses. I've also eaten their belgium waffle cookies in a jar which are delicious and am told that they are made by an old lady.\n\nThey have bar seating in the back which has a desktop if you desire to peruse the inter-web along with some tables and chairs, which has bookshelves of books and games.\n\nThe bathroom is quirky and kind of creeps me out. It is one of those you can look out from the bathroom and see everything and everyone but no one can see you inside. \n\nThe staff has always been friendly. One of the guys kept burning my boyfriend's waffle after two or three attempts (he forgot about it) and gave my boyfriend a freebie to make up for it. All in all a great place to go."
4,"My favorite thing here isn't even the Korean BBQ itself, but don't get me wrong the pork belly is my OTHER fave as far BBQ goes... They have this raw beef and inside they wrap it with a variety of different vegetables: MMMMMmMMMmmMM!!!!!! SO good! It is a MUST every time we go. They used to have it as one of the combo's but I'm not sure if they changed that, but either way, when we do all you can eat, we must order this on the side. NOMTASTIC. \nThey will typically cook the food for you at your table but once in awhile when we go we are on our own with that, but that's fine too. \nIf you are consuming AYCE, EVERYONE at the table must participate and will be charged. That kind of annoyed me since my daughter was with us when we were stuffing our faces and didn't eat ANY meat or anything except some of her rice, yet she was still charged the full price. They could change that up or at least have a kid price since they typically don't eat as much as adults do."
1,"I came here in a bind to buy a hard drive for a customer, who I had on the phone with me.  They have tickets on the store floor instead of actually stocking the hard drives.  There were several tickets for the drive I needed, I confirmed the higher price to my customer, then brought the ticket to checkout (500gb laptop drive).  After several minutes of waiting I was told they didn't have the item, but had a 32 or 64gig drive (useless to me).  Why are there tickets still on the floor for items out of stock?  I drove out of my way to Fry's electronics, and got a drive for literally half the price as this Office Max wanted for it.  This play may be fine for office supplies, but avoid for electronics."
0,"This place is horrible, went with a group of friends and as soon as we got there it was a crappy place. Being that the hotel is on the strip you would think there be an excellent upkeep but NOPE! That's not the case at all! \n\nAs soon as we parked we noticed that the hotel elevator smelled kind of funny, and didn't sound like the most secure elevator at all. We go and check in and the front desk person tells us that they'll being holding my security deposit AND the charge again but they were specific as to why (I called my bank upset and they told me that it's the hotels issue, the bank didn't have a problem releasing it).\n\nWe FINALLY get our room and we head up the elevator and notice how run down the hallways look. It looks like a hotel you'd see in a shady part of town and want to run in the other direction. Not cool. \n\nWalked into the room and OMG! The looks on our face were probably priceless. We turn  the light on to see the bathroom it looks like it wasn't cleaned properly, it honestly looks like they wiped it down really quick and moved on. We go and see the bed and we see there's a HUGE crack on the wall! I'm not even sure how it got there! \n\nThe entire experience was crappy for what I paid for and especially being that it's on the strip you would think it'd be better. \n\nMy advice, pay the extra $20-$30 to stay in a nicer place, your in vegas you deserve it!"
4,Fantastic vet!
4,"Yes, this is, indeed, the best market in the city.  The only way you could do better is to go to a farm stand at a farm and/or pick your own.  This is like the convention of the best and most well known and most local farmers there are in the area.  In supplement, some of the best stuff is brought in from California  So take your pick: super local direct from your farmers, or semi-local but exotic and fresh and brought to you with love and care by Kerry."
1,What is great about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...\n\nWhat is really good about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...\n\nWhat is OK about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...\n\nWhat sucks about this Starbucks just inside the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street is...it is expensive like airport Starbucks only even more so.  Like two tall (SMALL) drinks for about $8 bucks.  The service was not great and the place is grungier than your typical Starbucks.
2,"Well, can honestly say I have always wanted to visit this place ever since I heard Jr.(Earnhardt) owned it. Being a huge Dale Eardhardt Jr Fan, its only natural to want to check this place out, good or bad reviews.\n\nFinding this place can be fun, its located on the second floor of a shopping area right along side the charlotte hornets arena. Be advised you probably will have to pay 6-8 dollars for parking and walk to the place.\n\nFirst of all i went here for lunch so this place was not \""hoppin\"", nor was it busy when i got there. The building seems to have two halves, a club side and a food side. THe club side was blocked off kind of and was empty. Walking in my first thoughts were kind of disappointing. Nothing really \""racey\"" feeling about it, yes i know its not a racecar bar but yet kind of figured it would have some kind of feeling reminding you what the place was about or where it came from.\n\nTypical bar style room with the bar in the center and tall tables around it. Waitress took at least 10 minutes to come greet us after we were seated. Then our order took good at least 20-25 minutes to arrive, she kept saying she was going to check on the status then would walk over to another table. The more guest our waitress had, the longer we had to wait for refills and our check. All the female workers seem close so they focused on gossiping  more with each other while they walk past our table failing to notice my empty glass could use a refill.\n\nFood was okay, had the \""Dale Q\"" i think it was called, was a burger with shredded pork on it. Really didnt have alot of taste to it, had to add the bbq sauce to give it some kind of taste. However i did order the waffle sweet potato fries and those were excellent!\n\nOverall i left kind of bummed, just guess i need to visit it at nighttime. It seems being open for lunch, they only run the bare minimum staff and that effects everyone as more guest arrive for lunch.\n\nOh side note, dont get too excited if you see the mason jar they offer with your soda drink for 8 bucks, its plastic and a total letdown. Asked if they offer glass like it looks like in the picture and she said no.....only to find glass ones for sale at the spot to buy hats and shirts....."
0,"This place is a scam for people who thinks Panda Express is real Chinese food.  This place is horrible.  SO basically, the menu is divided by half Japanese food and half Chinese food.  Their food is so gross and they charged so much for a dish.  We ordered their garlic chicken and there were barely any chicken in there.  Totally over-priced and so not worth it.\n\nI also ordered their Sake Sangaria... OMG, it was the worst drink ever.  You know what it tasted like?  Pineapple juice.  The best part about the drink is the fruits that they throw in the glass.  That's exactly what I told the waiter.  \n\nAnd their service is just lousy.  I am not sure if they tried to be all fancy.  The hostess takes you to the table and they handed you the drink menu only.  We waited forever for the waiter to bring us the main menu.  Then we waited forever to get silverware  and napkins and we waited forever for the waiter to come back to take our order.  \n\nOverall, my take is this.  We don't mind paying $$$ when it comes to food.... IF IT'S WORTH IT.  Horrible experience and horrible over-priced food.  It sure makes me appreciate Panda Express so much more."
2,"Normally when I go to a restaurant I'm not annoyed when I'm given a kids menu. It's kind of a compliment since I'm twenty-four and a little sensitive about my age due to having a younger boyfriend. \n\nHowever, when I came here with my family the other day the hostess placed a kids menu down for me and thus began the silliest most awkward situation ever. My usual response is to just push it aside where my little brother is seated. Well when I did this the hostess promptly put another one down for me. This was so silly to me and my mother that we both laughed (in a non-rude way) The hostess then looked at me as if I were a naughty child and said, \""OH WOULD YOU LIKE A GROWN UP MENU??\"" There wasn't even a hint of playfulness in her voice. She was serious.\n\nJust about everyone heard. Normally I'm a pretty polite customer but I just rolled my eyes and mumbled, \""Yes, I'm twenty-four.\""\n\nShe didn't apologize and actually never brought me my own menu. I had to share with my MOMMY!\n\nThat hilarious story aside, the food is pretty good and reasonably priced. Their margaritas are buy one get one during Happy Hour so after a few of those the age situation was easily forgotten. My entire family ordered steak and said it was Houstons grade steak at Applebees price. I ordered fish and it was pretty good. They didn't charge me when I asked for a vegetable skewer instead of fries even though the skewer is more expensive on the menu.\n\nOh and also, I can throw my peanut shells on the floor. I feel like fucking royalty. The end."
4,DA BOMB!
0,"Very disappointing.  When ordered, I asked for the $20 pizza to not be overcooked or crispy on bottom, but the pizza was beyond crispy, more like crunchy.  When I asked for my money back, the cashier and cook looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language and stared at me with shark eyes.  Because it was crunchy, beyond even crispy, I'm assuming they did this just to spite my request or they are simply  unable to cook with skill. If you don't mind rolling your pizza out the door, because you actually can, then this is the place for you.  By the way, there was no apology or explanation as to what happened.  Bad pizza.  Bad customer service.  Go elsewhere."
0,"Tried to like this place and have given it numerous chances. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have always had a bad experience. Service is poor, food is not good and overall the place is overpriced for what you get. There are small, basic things that could be changed to help this place out. Tempe could use a great wine bar with dog friendly patio."
1,"Ok so this is a tough review for me to write, so let me start with the good. They have a special place in my heart for the work that they do. Now for the bad, I went in to donate some left over food and litter from my cat who I had to put down. This was an extremely emotional thing for me, I don't say that for sympathy but merely to add to the story and my experience. I walked in, clearly a bit distraught, I explained and received a perfunctory 'I'm sorry' followed by \""leave the stuff over there, and do you need a tax form?\"" No thank you, no, can we have your name, no, are you interested in donating money, no, would you be interested in volunteering. Those are all the freebees they get as I consult with businesses including 501C3s. I would be happy to consult with them and greatly reduce my fee because this is so near and dear to my heart. So if you are the executive director or a board member and you happen to read this, please contact me, you could be raising so much more money, and more importantly saving so many more lives."
1,"I was not too impressed, I felt no effort placed on my meal. Had dust on my grapes and sour fruits. I haven't been back to coras in some time!"
0,"This place is a run down dump. I felt like l was going to get a mersa infection just sitting at the table. The food is terrible, even for lndian food. The buffet is over priced. There are some great Indian places in Phoenix and this is not one. You can just tell that they do things as cheap as possible and don't care about quality. My guess is that the chef is mexican and not lndian! Move along."
1,"In general most things in Edinburgh are not as good as the Glasgow version and the airport is no different. \n\nMy current main gripe with it is the new layout. The drop off and collection points for the long stay car park are miles away from the actual terminal now. It honestly felt like I was on a 5k trek to get to where I needed to be. \n\nYes I am exaggerating slightly, but I just want to give the best possible description of how much worse they layout is than it was previously."
1,"Had dinner at Margaritaville tonight before the hockey game despite my better judgement as I have been there several times before. Waited 30 minutes and did get a decent seat outside to watch the crowd. The waitress was pleasant but as usual the food was just not that good. I ordered a Cheeseburger that was just 'so so'. The bun was not toasted and the cheese had not melted. My son had the Coconut Shrimp. It was cold and just not that appetizing. I just think that from a well-known chain like this, the food should be better. Lots of other options at Westgate, plan to try something different next time."
2,"It was close to 10pm midweek in Vegas and we were both starving and desperately needing something for dinner. We walked past this restaurant and decided to give it a shot. The decor was beautiful and from the moment we walked in the service was superb. Looking at the menu I was excited to try a number of things. I settled on their house sangria, bbq chicken pizza and the blue cheese truffle chips. As soon as J heard that red snapper was the fish special of the day he knew he had to order it. We were both really impressed with the truffle chips, they melted in my mouth and I could have made an entire meal out of them. When we got our entrees I dug into the bbq chicken pizza which was good but nothing outstanding. J's excitement about the red snapper quickly faded when he realized it was completely raw on the inside. We notified the server and he quickly whisked it away to get a new piece of fish cooked. About 15 minutes later he came back with another piece of fish and had J cut into it while he was standing there and sure enough the fish was raw again. Another 15 minutes later he came back out and the fish was no longer raw (yay) but as J was eating it he didn't have much to say except for the fact that it was now so overcooked that it was dry and had lost most of the flavor. By this time it was late, he was hungry and didn't want to wait for yet another piece of fish so he still ate it. A few minutes after finishing our entrees we got a surprise from our server who brought us coffee and a phenomenal chocolate souffle on the house due to the errors with the fish. It was a really nice touch by our server because he truly did seem frustrated for us with how messed up the fish kept being. I want to try this place again next time we are in Vegas because the service was top notch, but hopefully the food will be more consistent next time"
0,Put my feet up and ordered in. What came was a thin crust Pizza could be faxed to you and taste just as good. I also got one with everything that looked liked it could scare Jeffrey Dahmer.  So many options in Surprise why bother with this one.
2,Not a bad place I just had to many bobas  for my liking. Otherwise the taste was a welcome change.
2,"I'm not the biggest fan of carryout Chinese joints and it's far & few between that any of them are actually any good. A lot of the foods at these places all tend to taste alike.  \n\nHaving said that, the only thing I ever get at this place is their simple Cashew Chicken w/ rice & egg roll. I don't know what it is about it but I think it's pretty good after I've had to salt & pepper it enough to my liking. Egg rolls and rice are not bad and there's usually enough sauce from the chicken to give both of those the right zing.\n\nThe restaurant is an older place and is in dire need of some sort of remodeling inside. It's a great place for a quick, cheap meal to people watch while you're eating. The staff are always fast and efficient. I giggle a little bit that the owner wears a hair net. \n\nI wouldn't recommend ya'll going out of your way to try this place but I felt the need to pad my reviews with this \""A-OK\"" joint. ;)\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
1,"Everything here sickly sweet and not well seasoned. I ordered the schezwan chicken and instead if something spicy it was chicken in a super sweet red-colored (most likely food coloring) sauce. On another occassion, I tried the bi bim bop. Also not spicy and a little on the bland side but at least it was edible. Asian fusion should keep the essence of the dish and recombine it in innovative ways. In order to do this you should have some concept of how the original, traditional dish tastes and is prepared. Most of the lulu's cookbook was created by someone who has never tasted or set eyes on the original dish and has only read a description of the dish."
2,"Quite the attraction notwithstanding location. \n\nWe were hungry and my feet were starting to bother me so we headed up to the escalator for some fish tacos.\n\nThe menu was full of choices for burritos, enchiladas, and of course tacos.  I still asked the waiter if he would not mind changing it up for me for some grilled mahi mahi vs. fried fish tacos. I also asked him if they would put it on corn tortillas instead of flour. He most graciously said yes!  The fish was fine, and they put some sort of coleslaw on top, black beans with cojita type cheese on the side (yay no yellow cheese on anything) and the gratuitious orange colored rice. \n\nYou get green and red salsa with chips. The salsas did have some nice flavor/spice to them.\n\nThe menu also had some fun foo foo drinks but we were slowing down a little and ordered ourselves some coronoas instead.\n\nPrices were reasonable as well. \n\nTit for tat it was a decent enough place for the neighborhood."
4,"This is a really professional, friendly and comfortable place to learn and have fun.  We needed a refresher course before a big wedding, so we responded to an advertised package, liked what and how we were taught, and had no hesitation in signing up for more lessons.  We're almost ready for the wedding and now we're planning additional instruction for the next big event.  We've even joined in a few group lessons.  Our instructor makes the lessons fun, and there is just the right balance between technical and style instruction, understanding our level of competence, and keeping it light and encouraging.  We always look forward to the lessons."
3,"Just experienced this place for the first time, kinda. Grew up in Las Vegas without this my whole life, they finally opened a few years back. I tried it, wasn't a fan. Fast forward 5 years and I'm living in Phoenix, looking for an alternative to Starbucks, (soooooooo tired of them), and for some reason thought I'd give this a go again. Been seeing a bunch of commercials and this is close to my place. I'm very pleased, the inside is spacious and inviting, their menu has grown, much more choices than I remember. Most importantly, they are open late! I'm not a morning person by any stretch so to be open till 9pm is a huge win for me. This is my new late afternoon stop for when I need a snack or a pick me up to push through the last few hours of the day or wind down with a treat. Great location in Tempe with a big dining room and drive thru!"
4,The piano bar is awesome!!! All I have to say is these guys r hilarious! Upbeat and straight up entertaining!! This is very delayed. I was here 2/13/11. Wrote it while I was still at the bar and just haven't been on here in a while to post it.
4,"Definitely a hidden gem.  Felt like a nice romantic break from the typical Vegas dining scene while keeping up with the quality one expects in Vegas.\n\nStephan took great care of me and probably would have introduced me to the entire staff if given the chance.  Everyone was very friendly and complimented the food quite well.  I initially went in to have some escargots with a glass of wine, but was too tempted to pass up having something more.\n\nThe escargots were delicious.  At first it appeared as if they had over done it with the garlic parsley butter, but it doesn't over power the natural flavor of the escargots at all.  I probably would not share this dish with you, get your own.  As a bonus, I highly reccomend dipping the bread in the leftover parsley butter.  Yum.\n\nThe cheese plate is nice and what you would typically expect from a cheese plate.  The goat cheese is particularly good, but I also love goat cheese.  The candied walnuts were a nice touch.\n\nHad the duck for my main course.  They take a temperature which is nice because I like my duck medium rare.  It was very juicy and tender, which is difficult to do with med-rare duck.  I enjoyed it most out of everything.  The demi-glaze was not overpowering and the turnips and pears came together nicely.\n\nFor dessert I had the almond cake accompanied by the Clarendelle dessert wine.  A pairing I would highly suggest trying.  Great combo and cap to a meal that was supposed to be just an app and some wine.\n\nSpeaking of wine, they have Chateaneuf-du-pape by the glass which is very rare and quite a treat.  They also offer a 3oz pour which is great if you enjoy a shallow glass for swiriling as I do.  It also gives you the ability to have a variety of wines throughout the evening if there wasn't a bottle in their wine shop selection that tickled your fancy.\n\nThe only bad part of the experience was hearing a guest be unnecessarily rude to the manager for no reason when the manager was clearly trying to accommodate him as best she could.  He likely didn't enjoy his experience as much as I did, because he was too busy being a d*ck.\n\nAll in all, a phenomenal place.  You will love it if you aren't a d*ck ;)"
3,"Loved this place the moment we stepped foot inside of the elevator to get to the top.  Seven of us girls were in search of a great time and we found it here at the Foundation Room!  Advertised as exclusive and VIP, I thought to myself that surely they were trying to front like other Vegas clubs.  I drank my words as we were offered free champagne and cocktails while dancing to some hot beats!\n\nFR offers 3 rooms with spacious dance floors and a patio that is perfect for their gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  I admit that their dance floors are pretty small, but after several drinks you won't even notice the cramped space that has you dancing right up on another person :).  The aforementioned patio was a perfect place to get fresh air and if you can handle folks smoking in your \""fresh\"" air (which was a bit of a turnoff but whatever), you get a chance to take in all of the magical spark that makes the Vegas strip what it is.\n\nWe ended our night here and wished that we started it off at this spot.  Great people, great atmosphere, and I would definitely party it up here again."
0,"This place is horrible. I've been in here a few times and every single time, the service is unacceptably slow and the customer service is really lacking. I went in there another time and not a single employee in sight. Wtf? It was in the afternoon so it's not like they were closed.  I could hear people in the back talking. I called out for someone to assist me multiple times. I waited there for 5-10 min for someone to come out and not one person answered me or even bothered to come out. What the hell is up with that?! Hello...I'm about to spend money on your damn food and you ignore a customer?  Ridiculous. The owner needs to find some better employees because these people suck. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE: I tried calling the store to see if I could get a hold of a manager to speak to.  The phone rang for a while before the phone was finally picked up...the person on the other line didn't say anything.  After I said \""Hello?\"" the person just hung up without a word.  Seriously?  RUDE and UNACCEPTABLE.  How do you expect to run a profitable business with crappy employees like that?"
1,its ok.  visited on a tuesday night.  had the chicken fried rice... chicken dry.  egg rolls were good with the right amount of spice but the rest of the family's meal which was a bit of everything was all in all nothing different or unique than any Thai take out joints.  just ok.  service just ok.  price average.  lets just say not memorable.
2,"If you go to a Cirque show, it really shouldn't matter which one because they are all good.  Most of the other Cirque show doesn't really have a story.  This one does.  But the grandeur of the special effects, not the story, steals the headlines.  It's big and therefore awesome.  Having said that, the individual talent from the Mystere show clearly unshines the individual talents of this show.  You won't be disappointed; it just because of the story, it can get boring at times in between the grand exhibits."
3,"I saw Keith Urban and LIttle Big Town recently, this was my first concert since moving to Phoenix. I've seen Keith up close before and to save money we chose lawn seats, the sound was great, he played in the center for several songs giving us a close up performance, his lighting and video behind the stage was super. i agree the concessions/beer prices are ridiculous but I wasn't surprised. It was a perfect night weather wise, it did run late and we left a few minutes earlier than he stopped performing.\nI do recommend exiting the I 10 before 83rd, that's where all the traffic was. I will arrive earlier to get a better lawn seat but we had a great time, in fact will be there for Jason Aldean the 17th! For $30 sitting in my own chair in the lawn under the stars is worth it."
4,Best burgers ever!! Everything was so tasty. The service was outstanding shiranda I think thats how you spell her name was such a good server she was very attentive and made sure everything was perfect.   I would recommend this place if you're ever in Vegas. ..some things shouldn't stay in Vegas!
3,"This is probably the cheapest buffet I've ever been to. Yes, the selections are not as much as other places, but for the price, what are you complaining about. Just like other buffet, there are some good food, and there are some bad food. And from what I remember, this place was not bad at all. If I had gone back three times for more servings of food, then it must be good. So if you want good deal when it comes to food, then this is the place. Just remember to make the best deal out of a buffet, make sure you come hungry."
0,"Stayed in the hotel for a 3 day softball tournament. The location is great, but it's just not the cleanest. The place just looks like management doesn't care anymore. The hotel smells. The bungalows were a little better, but the view of the empty pool & raggedy resort area with construction tape everywhere left a lot to be desired. \n\nI complained, moved rooms, and even asked the room to be cleaned again, but their idea of presentation and mine are very different. Next time, I'll just spend the extra money."
3,I've been here for lunch a couple times and decided to check out their happy hour.\n\nSitting in the bar area they offer a limited food menu at great prices.  We ordered the fries and chicken wings.  The fries came with three dipping sauces and all three were good.  The wings were meaty and seasoned very well.\n\nI enjoyed a Kiltlifter beer in the bottle.\n\nNext time I want to try one of their flatbread pizzas.
0,"We went to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our waitress brought out a piece of chocolate cake for him at the end of dinner. It was completely unprompted so we thought it was complimentary, until we realized she charged us for it on our bill... Who does that?"
0,"I visited the East Blvd location this week and upon entering the noisy shop I proceeded to wait in line quite some time before getting my order taken. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and they gave me a philly cheesesteak, which I don't find out immediately since the sandwich is wrapped. I discover the mistake when I am back at my job and can't go back right away to get it corrected. I have been to many sandwich shops and never had such a mixup, but from my observation the shop is disorganized and perhaps understaffed. I may come back to try this place again and give them a second chance to see if they can get an order right, and if they can then I will post a follow up review."
1,"Not a bad place, service was good. Price seemed a bit high for what it was, I had the gyro pita which only had 4 slices of gyro meat on it. Pita bread was delicious. \n\nParking can be a bit chaotic, but they have an attendant to help guide you and manage the flow. Inside feels a bit cramped for me, but it also seems like they do a decent carry out business."
4,Delicious pizza and Theresa who works there always give great service with a smile and treats everyone well. This is very authentic Brooklyn style pizza. Theresa is very pleasant and makes the overall experience great.
0,"This is the last place you want to bring your car to be serviced. Disorganized, disinterested, and disrespectful was my direct consumer experience with \""Great Big Gaudin Ford\"". Simple battery change with diagnosis cost $250 and took two full days. Do not be deceived by their concept of \""appointment\"". There is no such thing. I was told Arrogantly \""don't call us we'll call you\"". This is like a joke that nobody laughed at when it was originally told...and keeps getting told over and over again...and still nobody is laughing because...it still isn't funny. You've been warned. Gaudin Ford doesn't care that you are a third generation Ford owner, that you've dutifully supported the dealership community or anything. Gaudin Ford doesn't know anything about you and couldn't care less.\n\nGaudin Ford gives Ford dealerships a bad name."
1,"We go to Nick's about once a year.  For the most part our experience has been positive.\n\nI tend to order pasta dishes while my wife enjoys the Chicken Parmigiana.  Both could be better and the place can get crazy crowded at times.  The tight space and food reminds me of Giuseppe's on 28th http://www.yelp.com/biz/giuseppes-on-28th-phoenix  Though I like their food better.\n\nSometimes you just don't feel like cooking.  When it comes to Italian food, how many of us want someone else to do it better?  In this department, Nick's is just okay. \n\nThe new management at New York 51 Pizzeria (formerly Redendo's) up the block might have the edge on Nick's. Time will tell.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/new-york-51-pizzeria-scottsdale\n\nSorry!"
2,"This location has a high turn around rate. It seems they have a new managers and employees every month. As far as their sub sandwich , they're at the bottom of the crap list compared to ports sub or jimmy johns. I like their flat bread and cold cut meat . Avoid everything else like their cook meat . Their bread is also drap n dry also. I hated subway for a couple years and realized it's the bread I didn't like . Now it's ok."
0,"A big FU to the waitress last night at the Carolina Ale House in Downtown Charlotte.  First, my two beer glasses were filthy. No apology, no acceptance of responsibility.  Second, we ordered wings and we were never asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese, a very typical side item.  You also failed to provide plates for the bones.  Third, when I ordered a simple cheese burger, I told the waitress exactly what I wanted. She came back with all of those specific items missing and asked if there was anything else I would like.  I politely responded by mentioning those items and she said she would be right back, so I waited.  15 minutes later, my burger is too cold to enjoy.  When she caught my eye, she said she remembered and will go get those items.  I said, never mind, just take my food and bring me the check, I'm done here.  \n\nHowever, I still felt obligated to tip.  Because, if I didn't tip, I'm sure she would have walked away and said; 'there goes another nigger that does not tip'.  And, I was not going to give her the satisfaction.  Besides, the bus boy and bartender did nothing wrong to lose my support.  So, she benefits because of them.  So, I gave the lowest amount I have in many years, 17%.  But, this waitress was f'n lousy.  Her name is Heather M (according to my sales receipt), so avoid her.  I'm sure the establishment is fine."
2,"Wanted to find a place to buy tortillas since I moved here. When I seen this place off of Grand, I had to stop here and try it out! I bought two dozens of flour and corn tortillas, one pork, one cheese tamale, and a bag of tortilla chips! The only item I was impressed with was their chips??? Their corn tortillas was OK, nothing special! Tends to break apart while trying to eat it. Flour tortilla had no flavor, just pain piece of bread. Tamale was OK. I could name four restaurant you can get a better tamale at. So, I was happy with my chips anyway! great flavor, not to much salt. Being from SoCal, their were plenty of tortilla shops better then here, hopefully I can find another place to try?"
2,Pretty good food. A wide variety of mexican dishes. Pretty authentic except for the lima beans in my burrito. Did not go well with carne asada and cheese :P
4,"I arrived at the Olympic Stadium quite late in the evening to try out the food trucks. Many of the trucks had run out of food by 10PM but I ended up stopping at the Landry & Filles truck who were still serving food. I tried the Deluxe Meatloaf Sandwich and it was amazing. Every part of this sandwich down to the bread, the sauce and especially the meatloaf were perfect. The texture that the toasted bread added worked really well. I haven't eaten meatloaf in years and this one did not disappoint!"
4,"Soooo many options! But I'm not surprised, since it's Ichiza's sister. Obviously not as great as ichiza, but it's quick and simple! Perfect for a quick authentic Japanese lunch!"
2,"Far from the best sushi spot in the valley, but still consistent and decent.  RA is certainly still doing something right as it continues to grow into a major chain across the country, and continues to be an \""it\"" place in old town when there has been a huge increase in competition over the years.\n\nRA is a fun spot to grab a drink and some food.  Prices may be a little high when you're not eating during happy hour, but the service is top notch.  RA is as good a place as any to start your night when in Scottsdale."
4,"The Monte Carlo is by far the best hotel for me. It's centrally located in the heart of the strip and despite the recent renovations next door, it still fits in great. I can't eat at any other cafe. Seriously, their food is so good. From their country fried steak to their chicken carbonara. So delicious! Any of their dishes appease any craving that I have. The dishes have always been cooked to perfection (except for the ONE time my hash browns were a little over-done, but it's cool). Other than that, nothing compares to their cafe for the price.\n\nTheir customer service has always been outstanding. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. IF something does go wrong, they always do their best to fix it.\n\nFor those of you who enjoy gambling like myself, the MC is great. I'm a slotty gal so can't say much for the tables, but they have machines that range from $.05 to $5. Can't say the same for Aria next door. $10 video poker?! I ran right back to MC.\n\nThe rooms I have stayed in were always clean. I also tip the maids regardless if they come into my room during my stay. If everyone at least left them a few bucks to show appreciation, it'd go a long way. Oh yeah, tip the cocktail waitresses too. $1 a drink is my rule. It's just a classy thing to do.\n\nAll in all, MC is my #1 hotel in Vegas. Affordable, awesome food, friendly staff, and great for gambling. I tend to never leave MC because I'm usually disappointed with the other options. I love you guys!"
3,"I prefer this place to the Forum shops a million times over.  Huge, huge variety of stores, awesome prices, and it never seems too busy.  I can spend an entire day here, if not longer, shopping and shopping and shopping.\n\nThis place is a nice break from all the casinos, buffets, and hotels on the strip."
3,The place is great. Very quick service.Wiil defentlycome back
4,I like yummy wine.  I like yummy beer.  I like yummy food.\n\nPretty hard to find a place that has all 3 out in the west valley of phoenix but here it is!
0,"Just terrible - \n\nWe purchased a bed for our son with a next day delivery between 8AM and 3PM. After waiting all day, we were called at 3:30PM with notification that they were an hour away, which didn't work for us since we had plans. \nThey informed us they would come the next day, and showed up, but with the wrong piece (They delivered parts for a twin bed, when we purchased a full bed) and after speaking to a very defensive-sounding customer service agent, were told they would deliver the correct piece the next day and that we would need to speak to a manager to get any kind of refund on our delivery fee. \nWe left a voicemail with a manager and never got a call back. \nThe next day the delivery man came, this time again with the wrong piece. The customer service agent said that while they apologized for all the errors on their side, they would only reimburse half of our delivery fee and that they would deliver the correct piece in two more days (5 days after the promised delivery date) and it's at this point that I informed them that I would not accept this and that I wanted them to return the product. The delivery man for some reason got mad at me and rushed back into the house to grab the other pieces of furniture that was already delivered the night before and off they went. He informed me that they would refund my money until all of the pieces were returned back to the warehouse so now my fingers are crossed that this truly happens. I have never had such a poor experience with a furniture company and will not shop here again. \n\nSuch a shame - my wife and I were big fans of the furniture displayed here and the prices too. But if you don't trust a company to deliver the product correctly, there is no way we can shop there again."
1,"So I hate to write a bad review but I'm all for giving any place a review if it was anything below or above average. Honestly, this was way below average. The pizza was literally the worst pizza I have ever had, ever.. it seemed as if it was left out all day, it was hard and very dry & they forgot my ranch :( the only reason I gave two stars was because my cheesecake was really good & the delivery guy was bad ass, I liked his attitude & just all around good vibes. The guy on the phone whom I ordered from was also very polite and nice. Just really bad pizza. If you guys can fix that, then you would be grade A."
2,"Ive seen two classical type concerts here and really enjoyed the venue. It was very beautiful, the acoustics were nice, and there was plenty of seating. What killed it for me was how long it takes to get a student ticket and the ushers. To get a student ticket the had to take my student ID and fill out a ton of information making my friends and I almost miss the first piece. Also the ushers are just AWEFUL. They let people in IN THE MIDDLE OF PIECES. And they talk to people and turn on flashlights in the middle of pieces to guide people to their seats. Now I understand how they are trying to be kind to their patrons, but this is really distracting to the performers. They can simply wait until the end of the piece or movement to seat people. The ushers are also really rude and impatient with people. My friend was playing in the second half of the concert and wanted to watch the first half and they said a snarky remark about needing a ticket. Are you serious?\n\nAll the aside the venue itself is beautiful and performances at the center are always enjoyable."
3,"After going to Square Cafe twice during peak brunch times, I have resolved to come early in the morning, which is perfect. Nice selection of breakfast items from your sweet to savory and for reasonable prices though I feel like they have changed the menu recently so that there are less items. Anyway I don't get the name of the cafe but there are shapes (not just squares) painted on the ceiling in bold colors with local art work hanging so it is a comfortable atmosphere. \n\nThe service has been good - coffee is always filled (cups that the coffee come in are shaped interestingly cool) and the waitresses check in at reasonable times with a smile on their face. They are there to get you in and out with a full belly due to the volume of customers.\n\nI've eaten quite a few of their scrambles and omlettes along with their home fries and toast. The combinations of the flavors work well and homefries don't need any additional seasoning unless ketchup. Pancakes are fluffy and sweet, love how there is a dallop of whipped butter and whip cream. I have yet to have the french toast but my boyfriend always orders them with strawberries.\n\nThis is a staple breakfast place for us."
4,OMG!!! Worth the money if you know what to order.  Service was great.. They are known for are the fried clarmari and the banna cream pie.  I went back every day to Emeril's while in vegas just to eat the dessert!!!  I recommend the Salmon dish for dinner.  I forget the name but I have to say this was the best Salmon dish I have ever had!!
0,"Wow!  The worst bottle service experience of my life, in Vegas or otherwise.  Not at all what I expected from this place given all the hype.\n\nWe had a table reservation for a group of five guys and two girls with a $3000 minimum.  We arrived around midnight and were seated pretty promptly at a prime dance floor table, as we expected for the amount we paid on a regular Friday night.  \n\nThe table next to us was crowded with girls and only girls - most of them hot local girls.  They were drinking for free from the cheapest bottles and were clearly \""employed\"" by the club, whether they were actually paid or simply lured by free bottles.  This fact became even more evident when we ordered our champagne and vodka and the bottle waitress pointed over to the girls' table and told us that if we see any we like we should point them out and she would bring them over.  It's standard practice in Las Vegas for staff members to bring girls to tables, but I found taking it to this level quite hilarious; regardless, props to them if it works as a business model.\n\nA little later on in the night, after having chatted with one of the girls from the pro-clubber table, her group of friends was sent off (sold?) to another big spending table. I decided to take the waitress up on her earlier offer to send ladies over.  At this point, to reach our $3000 minimum, we had purchased several bottles of vodka and champagne, much of which was still on our table unopened.  I asked the waitress about sending some girls over, and she replied, in the rudest manner I've ever experienced at a nightclub, \""You're drinking Stoli.  Girls aren't attracted to Stoli.  You should order something else if you want girls to come to your table.\""\n\nLuckily, it wasn't tough to find girls (she was quite wrong about girls and their attraction to Stoli), but this level of attitude is hardly what I would expect from someone set to make a minimum $750 gratuity from serving a single table.  This would never happen at a true top-tier club. I'll stick to XS and Marquee from now on."
1,"Brown rice is MUSH!  Today was the second time I've been since my office moved a block away.  I gave it another chance because there is no way a place like this would over cook their rice to the point where it practically melted together....think again.  I have been to Samurai Sams a million times over the years for the \""healthy alternative\"" to fast food and either something has changed to the quality of food or I've been there too many times that I'm burned out.  The rice issue is huge...who wants mushy rice?  Like someone said in reviews below-everything is now premade just sitting there.  Not sure how true that is but thats what it seems.  Big bummer. :("
1,"Like Yelps awesome description for each star ranking,this place is really just ''meh''.\n\nGreat place to JUST have drinks on the terrace during the warm summer days/nights.\n\nFood: I mean, it's Italian food. There's really nothing 'that' great about it, and without tooting my own horn, I feel there's a lot of things on the menu that my friends and I could make. But yes, it is good.\n\nStaff : Nothing special, but nothing bad neither. \n\nDecor/ambiance : probably one of the good things of this place. It has a nice urban/old style to it. \nLOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. This place is perfectly located on one of the most touristy streets in the city. \n\nI'd take friends there only if we haven't made plans/reservations. It's acceptable."
0,"Went in to race Saturday 7/13/2014. All was well until I received a work related phone call. Due to the loudness of the loudspeaker, i had to seek refuge in an area of the building where i could hear my phone call. Considering the policy on exiting the back door was changed today, i was forced to stand in the area to the east of the rear door to hear my phone call, rather than walking across the the building to exit the front door.\n\nI was approached by a guy with a walkie talkie who interrupted my phone call to tell me to leave the area i was in. I moved a few feet to away and was immediately approached again and ushered back into the area where hearing the phone call was not possible. I made my way to another area and was ushered away by the same guy, mind you im on a business call with a client in North Dakota. After struggling to hear my client for at least 5 minutes, I ended the call. The entire time i was on the call, the guy was watching me as if i was trying to steal something. I felt unwanted at this place so i packed up my pit and unregistered from the race. \n\nI went to the hobby shop for a refund, since my car hadn't touched the track. Yet again met another rude, pissed off employee who seemed burdened by my request, and denied my refund due to not being sure if I practiced......I advised the situation I just encountered, and nothing was said from the employee. I said keep the money and left... \n\nDo yourself a favor, avoid this place and go elsewhere. The track is so/so and the race director is terrible, always talking to his friends via the loudspeaker during races, calls incorrect times, just all around not organized and bad. I will NEVER be returning to this track, and will try my best to deter anyone from going here."
1,"This place has no idea about what it wants to be.\n\nIt advertises itself as mens clothing, but there is plenty of girls clothing too. The styles in OBC have  no coherance at all, they are all over the place - one minute you can be looking at emo/indie style tshirts and jeans, then two steps to your left you can be looking at sparkly ball gowns and the like. Really odd.\n\nI think the main compalint I have however is how expensive this place can be - you are much better off going to Princes Street."
0,"Stopped in the lube shop for an oil change. Walked inside and was shocked how dirty the place was. The bathroom reminded me of a prison movie, filthy doesn't describe its disgusting condition. I figured the oil change is quick so just deal with it. While waiting I started thinking while listening to the staff yelling and joking that the inmates taken over the jail. Bad feeling was growing. They pulled car out, said all done, paid and left. Drove across town for a meeting, got out and oil was pouring out under the car. What a pain in the neck. Took to the nearest store that was clean, staff fixed with no trouble.\nUsually these guys are great but this location will never be a stop for me again."
0,"As a few others have said, VERY bad customer service. They are unnecessarily rude, and I'm a pretty patient guy. I won't bother returning. Ammo is cheaper at cabelas and guns are much cheaper at budsgunshop and have them shipped to a local shop. Do yourselves a favor and find a different merchant or buy online so you can limit your exposure to douche baggery."
2,"An A.D.D. sports fan's dream! We were in Scottsdale for the weekend and wanted to watch the UFC event and have drinks and food.......we ended up here!\n\nThe waitresses appear to be Hooters' girls prior to enhancement. Cute outfits and pretty gals.\n\nThe service was a tad slow but the waitress was working her butt off, as it was busy due to it being an Oklahoma game and this being the local alums hangout. There were screens all around, friendly people, good atmosphere. The food was what prevented a higher rating. It was \""okay\"" and that is typical for a bar. All in all, a fun place to go, though!"
0,"Let's face it, these places are not free. If you feel like you deserve to live in a place that is properly cleaned and maintained you will have to place a lot of work orders. Most apartments have managers who make sure the place is clean and well maintained. This is not one of those places. Filth and chipped paint is everywhere. There is no excuse. A 20 second slop a mop does not cut it."
0,"Absolutely worst hotel experience ever.  I tried to work out a deal so that I could move to a hotel closer to my business for the week.  The hotel clerk promised me the rooms were clean.  Even though that was not my issue (although I was apprehensive about it after reading the reviews of cockroaches and bedbugs), he persisted that I can't do anything because the rooms were clean.  \n\nThere were baseboards falling off, behind the toilet was dirty, the room was LOUD  I could here people coming and going all night and early morning.  \n\nI decided to suck it up since I already paid for the room and they would not budge.  The first night I could hear the walls crawling, not a good nights sleep.  The second night I came back to the room to find a cockroach the size of my thumb, belly up the in the middle of the room.  \n\nI checked out first thing the next morning.  The morning clerk did not seem phased about this at all and joked about the bugs being big enough to carry my luggage to my car.  Now they are proceeding to fight me about a refund, swearing the rooms are clean (how about that customer service)."
0,"Back here for SHOT show...show itself is awesome but convention center makes me feel so digressed. Location is okay, but design of floors, access is nightmare, food option is worst, who in the right mind wants to host events here?!"
1,"I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short of expectations.  Yes, it has a rock-climbing wall, and everything else, but the ambiance lacked that soothing quality you need for relaxation and the massages are mediocre.  Either the Canyon Ranch experience has deteriorated over the past 25 years since the first resort was created, or the quality of the first one was never quite fully duplicated."
0,"This place was very disappointing to me. I've walked by it several times, thinking 'I need to try this place'. I got a 10\"" cheesesteak. It looked no where near how good it looked in the picture.\n\nThe length looked short, although I didn't have a tool to measure. There was a skimpy amount of meat. No lettuce or tomato. Mayo & mustard? I must not have heard that properly. For the price I paid I felt like I got the short end of the stick. Before I was done eating I was regretful that I didn't go to DiBellas instead.\n\nMy experience was so disappointing that I don't think a second chance would make a difference."
0,"I was so excited to try this place, it looked so promising. The service is decent. The d\u00e9cor was cool. The food is of terrible quality.\n\nI got the portobello burger. The portobello cap was cooked well enough, but the bun was dry as hell. I gave up on the bun after two bites and just ate the portobello and toppings. Speaking of which, they don't give you much for toppings. So when that menu says that something is \""topped with\"", they mean that they give you a sample for half your order. The fries they gave me were obviously the last of the basket short stubby bits and as such were poorly cooked. I couldn't believe that they would actually serve that to someone. \n\nThankfully they have at least one thing that can help to cover up their awful food. Their beer selection is very good (if you can manage to find a beer that they haven't run out of), so get enough beer to dull your taste buds."
2,"Recently opened and already having won several local awards, Pink Olive claims to offer \""exceptional food, no exceptions\""; this is definitely the case.\n\nMy partner opted for the 'Bigger, Meatier Breakfast' (\u00a37.95), which was essentially a double-sized portion of the perfect scottish fry-up,  complete with haggis. There wasn't a single thing on the plate that wasn't cooked perfectly, although i don't think i would have been able to eat a whole plate!\n\nI went for the slightly healthier sunday morning option, of the soup of the day (\u00a33.95) and a grilled mackerel fillet on a bed of lemon-dressed salad (\u00a34.95). The soup was seasonal vegetable and pearl barley, and was much tastier and more flavoursome than any vegetable soup i've had before. It's true that the mackerel was slightly greasy, however this was off-set by the crisp lemon juice drizzled over the salad. \n\nI'd definitely recommend trying the homemade iced teas. We couldn't choose between lemon or peppermint, so got one of each and both were delicious. My partner said they were the best he's ever tasted outside Morocco.\n\nIn fact, my only criticism would be the issue of space... or lack of it. Too many tables crammed into too small a restaurant took something away from the relaxed, sunday morning atmosphere."
2,"Just stopped in for second time this week. Ordering process went quicker. No snafus at checkout. Only had to wait a few minutes for fresh okra which they fry on order.  People before and after me had some errors in orders or  missing sides.  I did hear a lot of \""I'm sorry about that\""  but altogether seemed to go better. \n\nOrdered the 3-meat plate this time with Mac and cheese and okra.  The okra rocked! . The meat plate not so much.  Hard to decipher which was the brisket and which was pork. In my pic the upper left is the pile of fat I had to pick out before even tasting.   I may give them one more shot and that's it."
0,Not going to explain. Just don't waste your time.
1,"First, let me say that most of the reasons this place gets only 2 stars has to do with my opinion that the whole Red Robin chain has gone downhill in recent years. The meat is not particularly tasty anymore and the bottomless fries are now served in a literally bottomless cup which is more of a hassle than it's worth. So it goes, I suppose.\n\nThere were somethings that I made this particular visit sub-par though. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. Even after our food arrived we had to ask 2 different servers for utensils so that we could have napkins. Were either of these things disastrous? No. But they were unpleasant and when coupled with the prior comments about the  food were enough to make me think twice about coming back."
4,"I don't usually write reviews on services but James @ Hondatronics really impressed me.  I was in town and had a window switch that failed on me with my window stuck open and the temperatures in the 30's with a 240 mile drive back to LA.  I called a few other shops and they didn't sound like they could help me, but I saw Hondatronics on my GPS.\n\nI tried to remedy my window some more by myself and I blew a couple more circuits which made it worse.  I went by Hondatronics at 4:00 pm, it was near dark and James came out with a flashlight.  He trouble shot the problem within minutes.  He fixed all my blown circuits and got my window to roll up.  I was able to drive home that night."
4,"While it is somewhat embarrassing to write a review on how good a donut shop is, I feel I must do it. Bosa is hands down the best place in the Valley to eat a donut. They're indescribably good. I've been to many of the locations and they all seem to be consistently good. The product they serve is outstanding and I have been ruined for all other donuts because of this funky little shop."
2,"This restaurant has a few dishes which are vegan or can be made vegan. It has an emphasis on comfort-food type dishes, such as lentil stews with injera (a fluffy type of bread, similar to a soft South Indian dosa). I would go here if you're looking for something totally different from the usual South and East Asian vegan options in Madison."
1,"So first off you need to make an appointment for David's Bridal really? So I called and scheduled an appointment for 5:30 on a Weds eve I arrive at 5:30 &/ told them I had made an appointment first they couldn't find it then they said oh never mind we did & by the way you're consultant is working with another bride so you will have to wait ? Well why did I make an appointment then I asked ? they took me back and grabbed some dresses for me to try on and the girl didn't even help I got the gowns on myself so why do we need appointment? I think this place is trying to compete in a market of giving great customer service where they failed miserably the girl told me after I was there 10 min she was off in 30 min but no rush ? So why tell me then you're off when I had scheduled appointment and had to wait very disrespectful of my time not helpful i would not recommend. If I was their corporate office I would rethink things they need to be more walk in friendly and respectful of people's time , I will give them their prices are great for brides on a budget and do have beautiful dresses but customer service lacks and that's huge for me . I'm still in search for my dress I did find one I liked there but won't purchase unless I get a discount for my experience ."
3,"Definitely a fun place to find as you act like its a scavenger hunt in Vegas, the pizza was as New York as it gets in that part of town.\n\nSome might be turned off by the total lack of seating and long lines but all that is forgotten when you bite into your first slice."
4,"I have been a customer for 4 months. I shopped around and after lots of calls and conversations, hired Dori's.  Christian and Amber own the company and do all the work.  They saved me from a HUGE algae stain in a brand new 20,000 gallon in-ground pool! Stupidly I thought I could take care of it-NOT!!! They came and in two weeks got the problem solved! Saved my butt!  They are extremely knowledgable both about water chemistry and pump/filter systems. They can fix anything and solve any problem.  They are honest, and care about their work.  They are very nice and will respond immediately to any \""pool crisis\""!  All of this for the most reasonable price around. They come every week and my pool is beautiful! By the way, Christian is a former US Marine and has served in the Gulf War. He is an American Hero! Needless to say, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dori's Pool Service!."
4,"I stalk this truck.  I've been to industrial parks where I pretend to be a tech worker standing in line, strip mall parking lots, and of course the farmer's market.  The bowls are so so absolutely divine.  The owner is super friendly and he makes each bowl by hand with an incredible amount of pride.  You gotta eat here guys!!!"
2,"What sets Menchies apart from the rest? Was it their circular store layout or was it their inefficient toppings bar?\n\nThey must have paid a leg and an arm to secure a pretty decent location in the swanky lot of Scottsdale Quarters.  \n\nThe one thing that can definitely be improved upon is the counter space where the toppings reside.  During my last visit, this area felt kind of congested as a slew of patrons suddenly crept up after me.  I rushed my decision on what could go with what which resulted in a mediocre, mix and mash satisfaction.  I prefer to just take my time and figure out my desired blend!\n\nThe froyo itself was comparable to other places.  I'm not a connoisseur in this particular food, but they may have had one or two unique flavors in their froyo line up.\n\nIf you are ever lurking around Scottsdale Quarters after dinner or a day of shopping and have an itch for froyo, look no more."
3,"Played the Lexington Course \n\nVery enjoyable experience. I got a golf now deal for 65 dollars (In May) as opposed to the rack rate of 200+. For the price I paid it is probably a 5/5, if it was 200+ I would probably knock it down to a 3/5.\n\nI was very surprised in the elevation changes not only in the course but in the surroundings. My first Vegas golf experience included scenic views of the strip and the mountains. \n\nThe course itself was moderately challenging with a number of holes having large landing areas but beyond that was trouble. I played with a family who was high handicappers but they still enjoyed the round, even with the number of penalty shots they took. \n\nAs far as the staff I can't give them enough credit. The pro shop and bartenders were very professional and polite. The starter and I carried on a pleasant conversation about the course and other random Vegas golf factoids for about 10 minutes (I actually just wanted to practice putt but he was a really nice guy so I couldn't be rude).\n\nI would definitely come back here for the price as it would be one of the cheapest options in Vegas"
0,"So we were hung up on again will trying to get the key the opportunity,to correct her problems. Very unprofessional if you sold equipment that work there would be no issue. If looking for appliances go to Home Depot or Lowe's"
4,"We loved everything about Frost! The service was great and the Gelato speaks for itself, absolutely delicious! We especially loved that everything was made fresh on site and does not contain preservatives.  Friendly staff and a clean store. Definitely a place we plan to visit more often."
0,WARNING DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! Whatever you do stay away this place is back under the old management and it's terrible. Been shut down by the health department so many times!! Most of the stuff they serve is from restaurant depot and is not very good quality. Please save your time and money for all sushi restaurants sake. So sad the other owners didn't work out the food quality went way up now it's just crap like before.
0,"I had the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAPPENED. DONT EVER STAY HERE, THIS PLACE DOESN'T DESERVE ANY BUSINESS. about a month ago my friends band was headlining a show there, we packed the place, spent all our money having a great time, we all stayed there too. About 8 rooms we had all together. In the morning I stummbled out of my room to ask the front desk for MATCHES so I could have a cigarette outside. Next thing I know the security man grabs me starts to man handle me and pushes me outside. Says I'm kicked out and that he's calling the police...BECAUSE I LEFT MY ROOM? I'm five foot one and petite, wearing jeans and a tshirt, IN NO WAY WAS I THREATNING LOOKING OR LOOKED LIKE A PROSTITUE. so at this point I'm getting scared, call my son at home and tell him to call 911 because I'm being harassed and pushed around by the security for no reason. I have never been treated like that in my life. Finally my son gets ahold of my friends who are upstairs sleeping, and they come down and save me, we leave. I call the corporate office, who then gives me the name of the manager. I call him and explain what happened, he tells me it's my fault because I admitted to being intoxicated from the night before. REALLY, REALLLLLY, SO APPRENTLY IT'S NOT OKAY FOR ADULTS TO CHOOSE A LOCATION FOR A PARTY DRINK GET DRUNK STAY THERE, AND NEED MATCHES IN THE MORNING. I WAS BESIDE MYSELF WHEN THAT'S WHAT THE MANAGER SAID. THEY ARE THE WORST, WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS FLAT OUT WRONG, AND I SHOULD HAVE PRESSED CHARGES, INSTEAD PLEASE READ THIS AND SERIOUSLY CONSIDER GIVING THIS ESTSBLISHMENT ANY BUSINESS. IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AND I CAN ELABORATE. jaynafay@gmail.com"
3,"This is really cool place and the service is AMAZING! We had a great time and the ambiance was just perfect. A mixture of contemporary flair with interesting decor. I do want to share some details about my experience. Visited for dinner. 10/3/2012\n\nService: Simply amazing. The waitresses were all smiles and very accommodating. I had several requests for my dish and they got them perfect. Both waitresses were always checking in on us and I thought it was great how they supported each other.  Nothing fell through the cracks!\n\nAmbiance. Casual and hip, yet romantic. Lots of energy in the place and you could see others were enjoying their conversations sitting around their rustic wooden tables and eating great food. \n\nFood (appetizers). The mussels oreganata are out of this world. I truly believe you would be hard pressed to find a more flavorful dish anywhere in town. The textures and flavors in this dish are very unique...you will love them. The sweet chili and bacon prawns were great but a little too sweet and spicy for my taste.\n\nFood (entrees). I was really excited for my beef wellington but unfortunately it was average. The pastry around it was thick and the sauce tasted like it came out of an instant gravy packet :(  The scampi stuffed chicken pasta was very good and the balsamic vodka sauce was incredibly flavorful.\n\nPrice. For a casual dinner for two, $150 was a tad expensive for my taste. Do not get me wrong, the food is great but I do not think charging around the same amount as some of the high end restaurants on the strip entices customers to visit as often as they like. It their prices were a bit less expensive, I would definitely visit quite often. \n\nOverall experience. Great restaurant and I would recommend it to friends and family. Having said that, I would try other stuff on the entree menu and would most certainly NOT recommend the Wellington."
1,"Recently moved from Washington State and decided to go here with my mom.  We heard good things, so what the hell.  It couldn't be too bad, right?\n\nWell...\n\nWe kept it simple and only ordered a few appetizers: fried egg rolls and chicken satay.\n\nThe egg rolls reminded me of what I would find in a cheap Chinese restaurant and the chicken satay was dry, tough, and overcooked.\n\nI can only assume that people around here must not know what good Thai food tastes like.\n\nWe won't be back."
1,"Extremely busy for 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Had to wait for a table to be cleaned.  You can tell they do alot of business. .. but the interior needs a good scrubbing.  The bathrooms are filthy,  the high chairs are black with grease..i can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  The food was good. .. you hey what you pay for."
4,"My husband and I moved to Charlotte about 9 months ago from Los Angeles.  We are both native Spanish-speaking Latinos and grew up in households where eating traditional Mexican foods as well as Central American foods was part of our daily lives (I'm from Nicaragua and my husband is Mexican-Cuban).... \n\nComing to Charlotte, we knew that it would be difficult to find food that even comes close to the awesome-ness of LA's Mexican-food scene.  We are truly foodies when it comes to Mexican and Latino cuisine.... \n\nWell, Three Amigos is as close as  you're going to get to the BEST Mexican cuisine in Charlotte.  All the food is made from scratch and they serve traditional Mexican fare: tacos in warm corn tortillas, topped with onions and cilantro; Enchiladas made from scratch with authentic sauces.... If you eat meat, their Al Pastor is pork marinated in spices over 24-hours and is phenomenal... The Gorditas are hand-made: thick, hand-made corn tortillas stuffed with goodness; Plus, you can tell everything by the rice and beans (the staple of any mexican dish or latino dish)... Their mexican rice is just like my father-in-law used to make and refried pinto beans that are fresh, not from a can!\n\nYou cannot get Mole anywhere else in Charlotte that is authentic - this is the only place I have found that makes an amazing mole....  Plus, if you've got little ones, they are a family-friendly spot too... Our two-year old loves it here!  The service is great - everyone is friendly and attentive.... you may have to wait a little bit for your food but that's because it's actually home-made and not \""reheated\"" from a can.... Do yourself a favor, and head over there for some delicious food!"
0,"This place is a joke. Maybe I am missing something, but any remnant of Rat Pack or previous organized Las Vegas business elements (wink, wink, nod, nod) is not evident. Maybe stains they left behind. Seriously. Have you seen this place? The diner stinks like old grease and dirty dish rag. The fireside lounge, well, let's just say, I threw all my clothes in the wash that I was wearing when I sat on those sofas. It does not evoke any coolness of the rough and tumble Vegas that some want to believe. It's more of a slimy, seedy underbelly. I need to go take another shower."
1,"Food and service very inconsistent.  Last time we were here the owner was in and everything was great - food had great balance and you could actually taste each ingredient.  This time, not so much - ribs were very spicy but not a lot of taste other than that...  Food was cold, slow service."
1,"In general, most Champaign area Korean restaurants start out with bad service. This place is no different. After ordering your food, it typically takes 10-15 minutes to get your food, and it doesn't always come out in the same order as you ordered. On top of that, you'll often have other people that cut into line and get the same food that you ordered before they did.\n\nOn this occasion, I ordered duk mandu guk and it came with soggy seaweed in it. For the price of $10, it was a bit more expensive than other Korean restaurants in the area. In addition, it didn't taste spectacular to any degree. The only consolation was that it came in such a big bowl that I could take a little bit home for a leftover meal.\n\nAnother dish that is pretty popular is their BBQ bulgogi. It usually comes with a special sauce but it really depends on the day to figure out whether it's good or not. Sometimes, it's under cooked. Other times, it's over cooked and burnt. They also use about a 50% onion to 50% meat ratio so it seems like you are paying for a lot of onions and not a whole lot of meat.\n\nThe seating is usually crammed so during rush hours, it's hard to find a seat. There is very little room to back your seat out as seats are pretty much back to back."
1,"Not bad, if you like low quality, pre-prepared school cafeteria lunch food. Make sure you ask which dish has the surprise plastic wrap hidden in it. If you find it, you're the night's winner! And the plastic is your prize!"
0,"EXPENSSIVE FOR NOTHING! You have to realy wanna blow some $$ to be seet that you blow some $$$.\n\nMen $20 Women $10 to get in. To \""rent\"" a seat MINIMUM in food and drinks $100/chair!"
1,"I though it was overpriced, the steak was good, but not great. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Vegas that are better for half the price."
2,"The first time I went here I thought it was amazing. The second time not so much, it could be due to the fact that my mom was vomiting in her napkin(alcoholic) and it just killed it. It just didn't seem to deliver like i remembered. Not sure I'll be back."
3,Delicious burgers that are full of flavor. We ordered the OMG & the Black & Blue burgers. We really liked the smoked bacon flavor. \n\nWe also got a basket of sweet potato fries. They are too thin to really taste the flavor & they don't hold their heat well. The regular fries were fine. The sauce bar was super fun to experiment with!!\n\nDesert was a chocolate peanut butter shake. It was divine!! Just the right texture and mix of flavor. Yum!!
2,Don't expect friendly service from the staff there.  The telephone receptionist is VERY rude.  The lanes however make up for the poor service.
2,"$1 beer was nice, but wing was  hard as rock, I asked if this was harder than usual but they said that was the one I should enjoy...  not for me."
1,"The most important thing to note about this restaurant is that the service is not good nor quick.  As others have noted, make sure you have ample time before your flight.  If you do, this is a great place to relax while you're waiting for your connection.   \n\nFood quality is not great.   I chose this restaurant over Burger King and actually regretted my decision afterwards.  Pluses are: the good atmosphere of the restaurant and the cold beer, which helps, especially when your plane is delayed by a few hours due to weather.  \n\nOverall. I rate this two stars based on the service and the food."
2,"Four of us came for dinner on a Saturday night, and we had mixed feelings about the experience. I get the sense they are still working out bugs regarding communication among servers and between servers and the kitchen. The food was generously portioned but lackluster.\n\nIt took a while to get our orders taken due to our intended server getting held up with a large group, so a different server took our orders, but our appetizer order got lost somehow, and after around a half-hour wait our mains showed up without the appetizers! By this time we had our original server back, and when he found out about the mistake he was very apologetic and worked quickly to get our food to us.\n\nThe food itself was just okay. One upside is that the servings were quite large, so we left feeling stuffed. The meat on the shawarma platter was good, as was the lamb kebab two of us ordered, and the arayes with meat were pleasant (though a bit scant on the meat filling), but the rest of the meal ranged from average to disappointing. One of us ordered the vegetarian platter, and it came with the stuffed grape leaves so dried out that they were basically inedible. The falafel is very underwhelming, and tastes like it might have been prepackaged and just heated up in-house. The vegetables that were supposed to come with the meals ended up being a few small pieces of tomato and onion, and a skewer with one small piece each of onion, tomato and bell pepper. I had to ask for an extra side of tahini sauce, as the shawarma plate came with maybe a teaspoon of the sauce on the plate. Also, I don't know if the server didn't hear us, but when we mentioned the dried-out grape leaves in passing, he didn't respond.\n\nOverall, it was a meal I might expect from a cheaper, take-out kebab restaurant, but with sit-down prices and scattered service. We probably wouldn't go out of our way to eat here again."
1,"Would not use as a shipping service, they are extremely slow to process even if there is no one in line. Makes even the post office look good."
4,Love the chicken tacos. Best I've ever tasted. Very authentic Mexican food. Great selections of Mexican drinks as well. I'll be back again and again.
1,"We haven't been here in a long while.  Not impressed, most of the food is cold. Crab legs have no taste or just taste gross. \nTerriyaki chicken was dry as was the sweet &sour chicken, pork ribs too fatty. \nNot coming back."
2,"lunch: i like the multi national spread but nothing was stand out awesome and definitely NOT worth the cross-trek of the strip that nearly gave me heat stroke. \n\nclean, fresh, good service. worthwhile but probably only if it was in your hotel or nearby."
1,"Was in Vegas for Bachelor party and we got quotes from various hook up's for a cabana here.\n\nWe got 5k for a cabana, and 10k minimum by the pool.\n\nThat includes food, drinks. . and your left testicle."
4,"Two words: HELLA GOOD. Wish we had one of these in Oregon! Visited in October while on a business trip. So glad we chose this place over the pho place a few doors down. Nothing against the one a few doors down, I have never been there but EVERYTHING about our experience at Pho Kim Long was awesome. We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.\n\nEverything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.\n\nTo top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!"
1,"came to rhythm kitchen on a recommendation from a friend.  the warning sign went up pretty quick when the server recited the evening's special.  barramundi with coconut risotto and mango salsa.  is that Cajun?  thankfully I passed but one of my dining companions made the mistake of ordering it.  I tasted the fish and although it hadn't gone bad.....yet, it was well on its way.  I started with crab cakes.  not bad.  for dinner I had the jambalaya.  again not bad but I could have made it in my own kitchen and it would have been at least as good, if not substantially better.  we shared beignets and bread pudding for dessert.  never really had a beignet but I wasn't impressed.  give me a good sopapilla anytime.  the bread pudding was like the rest of the meal."
0,The hostesses didn't say a word to me until I had been staring at them and tapping my foot for seven minutes while they talked with each other. Later on getting the check and then processing it each took ages. It wasn't even a full section. The food was okay...
2,It's somewhat ok. Seems clean enough. Don't use powder detergent though. At least not on the front loaders the fans blow all the time and that powder will get blown in your face. They need to work on more places to sit too. Not always easy to sit outside when it's hot or you're pregnant and need to get off your feet.
1,"COLORED ONLY: Sat in what felt like the minority section of the patio which was the secluded darkened desolate corner area. This area probably wouldn't have been so bad, but this area also doubled as the smoking section for a family of Russians who decided to come out for a smoke while we were eating...not \""da harasho\"" for us. So if this didn't make you feel like you were in the \""minority section\"", I guess the lack of space heaters would. Every other table had at least one/two space heaters in the vicinity, but we got ZERO on a slightly nipple chill'n' night. When we asked Roger our server for one, he just responded with an off-the-cuff response that there weren't any space heaters (we're out of propane/not working). This would have been slightly tolerable, if we had just popped in unexpectedly, but we had reservations well in advance because this was for a bachelor party (also our tables and chairs didn't match the rest). The only way this was rectified, was luckily for us a food runner named Tommy took the initiative and went into action and GOT US A SPACE HEATER. I'm glad he stepped up, otherwise we would have just gotten left in the cold. \n\nSo why did we not get the attentive service we should have? Maybe our party looked young, and they didn't feel as though they had to go the extra distance, but whatever the reason, Roger didn't come through as he should have although I should say he was very professional in managing his ability to hold on to whatever tip he could hope for. Also his other assistant Mano (don't know the spelling) definitely did do a great job because he did most of the work (not a shock he was minority, haha). Of course, what should be said is that we were most likely just the recipients of bad service/management, but I throw it back to race and blame it on my  Filipino entourage.... Ok, all kidding aside, the moral of this story is that it's not necessarily race/discrimination, but sometimes its just crappy sub-par service whatever color you are."
1,"So Container Park is super cute!  My friend and I went there for the first time last night and decided to grab something to eat at Pinche's.  We love Mexican food so we were pretty stoked on it.\n\nI got the carnitas taco combo plate.  I was not happy with it at all.  I love the simplicity of street tacos, but that means the meat needs to be seasoned properly!  The pork was so bland!  And they don't give you enough salsa to make it taste better.  The corn tortillas were soaking wet so I couldn't even pick them up and eat them like a taco.  I looked like a real gringa using a fork.  The beans were also extremely under seasoned.\n\nI'll probably just go to the BBQ place next door if I'm ever over there again.  Sorry!"
2,"This is a fun place to stay when you don't want to spend a ton of money on a hotel room.  It is far enough from the strip so that you aren't stuck in that nasty traffic.\n\nThe front desk and valet service is always nice.  Their complimentary drinks (while playing) are always strong and their food isn't too bad.  The pool area is nice although they can use a little more shade options out there. \n\nThis place can feel a little run down from time-to-time in their regular rooms and they definitely need some upgrades.  Outside of that, it is not too bad of a place to visit every now and then."
0,Again another Chinese restaurant that pre cooks their sweet and sour chicken and anything that is deep fried. The sauces on the food were mediocre and the meat was dry and overcooked because of the precooked nature of the food.
3,"While waiting for our flight to Houston this morning, we stopped at Phipps Bistro for something to eat.  One of the airport's employees recommended their establishment, said that ate there about 3 times a week.  My wife had the cheese and egg sandwich and I had the ham, cheese and egg sandwich.  Both sandwiches were very good, with ample eggs, meat, and cheese.  The rolls were very fresh and tasty.  Very quick service."
3,"This is my favorite car wash in Las Vegas.  It's the type where you drive through the automated washer cave inside your car  and then when the cave spits you out your get out and the washer boys vaccuum the inside of your car, shine the wheels, put armorall on your dash, etc. The staff here are so friendly and helpful, both the oil change staff and car wash. They all seem so grateful to be working here which is refreshing.  When I got my oil changed (this gets you a free car wash) it was finished in 20 minutes and I went on a Sunday at about 10am!  Bravo!"
1,I guess they stop the show after midnight =\\
1,Another new name but the same overpriced stuff. The theater is getting more and more run-down looking. Maybe the new owners will spruce it up? I hope so--the building isn't very old...\n\nBut expect more of the same so far with Carmike Cinemas as we have experienced with Digiplex and Ultrastar before it.
4,"The spring on our garage door broke on Sunday. I called Chris and he offered to come out that day so that I could get my cars out. I knew I wasn't going anywhere so I told him that Monday would be fine. Sure enough, Chris showed up when he said that he would. He put on two new springs, adjusted the opener, and lubed the hinges. Now my garage is about 75% quieter than it was. Chris did a great job! I would highly recommend him."
2,"I have seen this show 3 times now since 2008. It's a great way to get dinner and a cheap show. I have heard from people who have been to medieval times that it's very similar but since I haven't been there, I can't judge. \n\nLast nights experience wasn't as good as the first couple times but it was still good. My fianc\u00e9s chicken was very moist but mine was pretty dried out. All else was good except that my waiter didn't refill my drink until the show was almost over (it had been empty for 15 minutes and he walked by it 4 times but never stopped) he did fill my fianc\u00e9's cup but she was drinking something different and I guess he couldn't be bothered to bring the sprite to me. \n\nThe show was good as always but I missed the acrobat that used to perform at the end that has been replaced by the show horse. Oh well. I still enjoyed it and would probably do it again for a decent show and meal at a good price.  I recommend it."
1,"Just signed up and already to 3 strikes.\n\n#1-Some creeper stared at me while I swam laps in the pool and clipped his nails for a full 30 minutes.\n\n#2-Signed up for a trainer, showed up ready to go and found out they had \""lost\"" my appointment. No one apologized, acted like it was my fault, and just rescheduled me.\n\n#3-My husband reported that the men's toilet had pee all over it. Seriously, GROSS!\n\nSince I made the financial commitment and really want pool and yoga access- I'm going to try another location out. My husband on the other hand is ready to cancel and go back to Gold's."
2,"It's really not fair to rate an Indian restaurant based on its buffet only. Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \n\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\n\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\n\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\n\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\n\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review."
2,"This is a friendly bustling neighborhood-type place which I love.  The three stars only are for having fish on the menu that isn't up to the standards of their beef dishes and apps. Sea bass smothered in a sweet and sour sauce with chiles, not very fresh and overcooked --uggh.  However, I did croon over my neighbor's beef dish. The crab mini-tosadas are really good. And the vegetable side dishes-all of them, including brocolini, brussel sprouts, potato in a pot, and asparagus--are commendable.  Great atmosphere!! Have fun."
2,Oreganos is always good for what it is; family dining and big portions.\n\nSOMEONE PLEASE TURN THE MUSIC DOWN. Please. Please sweet baby Jesus turn it down. Trumpets blaring in my face make conversation impossible here
3,"Best creamery in town! They currently hand out buy one get one free coupons (limited to waffle cones or waffle bowls) if you get a medium or large icecream. Not sure how long the deal will last, but it's definitely a steal, and it's great for friends/lovers to enjoy. Some of my favorite flavors include dark chocolate, butter pecan, and nutter fluff. So good!!"
2,"This is like a fast food asian type of spot. Its pretty good for what it is. Stopped by here one day because it was close to a golf course that i wanted to play at. Think i had the lemon pepper chicken, it was good."
3,"Came here on a Saturday night with my man friend and were pleasantly surprised at the emptiness of the restaurant.. ( I really hate waiting.. who doesn't?) Any who.. we already knew what we wanted to get before coming here.. \n\nKaraage _ Like everyone has already said.. It is delish!!! Crispy but not oily~ good portion too~!\n\nFukumimi ramen_ i asked to add some garlic oil to it but I don't know if that even made a difference. I thought it was pretty tasty.. Pretty rich but not TOO porky.. and not overly salty like Monta's ... & Noodles were cooked perfectly.\n\nTan Tan Men_ It was my first time trying this dish and I thought it was pretty good.. It had some sort of deep nutty flavor to it.. I don't really like nuts that much LOL so i was good just stealing a couple bites from my bf~ \n\nKimchi_ my BF really liked their kimchi haha it is more of the fresher variety so it didn't have that fermented sour taste that I like.. \n\nNice waitresses & chefs, fast service! Check it out if you're in the area ;]]]"
1,"First: Big ups to Yelp and giving me a 20% off food coupon on my phone after checking in at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9.  We were in a group of 10 so that was big savings.  Showed it to the waiter and he applied the discount no problemo.\n\nFood: Disappointing to say the least.  Pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.  I also observed my other friends who did not finish their food, not a good sign given that it was lunch and we were hungry. \n\nDrinks: had a large sized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.  Tasted like there was no booze at all.  My friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.  Not happy.\n\nService: combined with the 20% off Yelp coupon, the service was the saving grace points of our visit.  Our guy was spot on, full of energy, would sing along with the tracks in the background and give us descriptions of the dishes.  Now if only the descriptions could turn into taste, it would have been a better experience."
3,"A friend recommended this place to me, though he was recommending the steak (which I don't eat).  I went anyway cause I needed a break from the high-prices and low-value of the strip.  Tuesday was italian night, so I got an appetizer, salad, chicken/pasta and a cannoli plus a glass of house wine -- all for $10.99.  Everything was tasty.  The waitress was nice; the fellow patrons were an eclectic group.  The beer was really good.  I would definitely go back.  We paid less here for dinner than we've paid for any other meal since we arrived."
4,"Wonderful variety, small portions and great favors. Perfect for a special occasion. Ambiance could be improved."
0,"The front staff seemed disorganized and when giving me paperwork they handed me a copy of someone's insurance and ID. Now I know accidents happen to all of us but in the medical field you really have to be careful about protecting patient's privacy. Then there's Dr. Stewart. He appeared flat and uninterested while examining my child, and very dismissive to my concerns. Then after walking out I heard him complain to his nurse, asking who had referred my child because he doesn't want just anyone to be able to come to his clinic. I guess my daughter's condition doesn't bring in enough money."
4,"Professional caring staff dedicated to their clients happiness. Dr. Matt came highly recommended to me from several friends and I am now a believer. I am seeking anti-aging therapy and he is a known expert in the field. Also, they are VERY price concious and try to save you money at every turn."
3,"WOB is a pretty cool place. I live really close by so for convenience purposes, it's a great place to kick back and have a few beers. The beer selection, as expected is outstanding and the staff is really friendly. I have just recently started expanding my beer pallet so I'm always looking for recommendations and suggestions on different beers, and the staff is usually able to point me in the right direction. \n\nThe prices are a little high for a beer (generally about 5-6 bucks a piece) so I try not to come here too often and the fact that they don't have any food is a little disappointing but I guess if you're a beer lover, this is the place to be."
0,"Service sucks. Food is decent, except they never get the order right.  Every time I have been there I have either been treated so poorly for no reason, I would rather go to a different location so I don't get snarled at by the staff."
4,"My husband and I frequently come here while we lived in the area. We love this place! The quality of the food and the service is awesome!  I don't mind the price, I rather spend the money on fresh REAL food than throwing my money away to a sub par establishment. The staff is so awesome! We will miss this place! Keep up the good work everyone!"
2,The food is good but they take FOREVER at this location. I've received much faster service at other locations. It's as if they have one cook in the back and 5 people on the floor. Management can you please staff appropriately. Still sitting here and it's been 20 minutes
1,"Cheba Hut. I think this place is okay. The pokalolo was my favorite sandwich. I have gone into this place many times, but always felt like something was either missing or needed to change. I don't think I ever really picked up on what that thing was. I will say that there is a lot of people who love this place. \n\nI think it is a bit overrated and got tired of the whole weed theme behind it. I also felt slightly disgusted by some of the people who made my sandwiches there (taking a shower is too mainstream for some of them)."
1,"This place is pretty dumpy.\n\nWork sent me to Phoenix for a couple of days.  I had a suite, but it was not very sweet.  The bathroom door didn't shut, and swung open into the middle of the room.  When I got up to go to the bathroom at night, I ran into the door.  I can only blame Country Inn and Suite for the first night, the second night when I bumped into the bathroom door in the dark, I blamed only myself.\n\nThe bed smelled like my old roommate's closet... musty and dirty.  Two of my towels were stained with something yellow, I am hoping coffee and not urine...\n\nI didn't really expect better, but that's my review."
1,"Fun scene, great place, met lots of cool people. Open and airy with lots of dance space except no one was dancing. Why? The music was lackluster. My friends and I tried to dance but it was short lived. More trance, house, even some techno would get things moving. Despite the boring music I had fun but doubt I'll be going back too soon."
2,"Stopped in today for...du duh, New Review #400!  Mr. Leno here is a fast casual place, & I found it to be clean, modern, somewhat stylish, & comfortable except for a TV blabbing out some movie.\n\nFor a hearty lunch, I had a couple of Chiles Rellenos, a shredded beef taco, a cheese enchilada, & some beans & rice.  The staff was friendly, the service took a while.  The Rellenos were made with mild Anaheim chiles & topped with some Guacamole.  They were good, but I would have liked a little more fire, & they weren't as warm as I thought they should have arrived.  The taco was good, plus nice & big!  The enchilada was really blah & Gringo.  The refried beans & Spanish Rice were both ok, but not special.\n\nThere's a good salsa bar, & the prices are reasonable, so I think this one is \""A-OK\"" overall.     :-)\n\n23 Combination Plates available, mostly around $6 to $7, plus reasonable ala carte prices."
4,"I was recommended to Dodge Electric by my sister. I'm happy to say that I was highly impressed by Dodge Electric and their expert services and fair prices. We hired DE to install our alarm system (they also provide monitoring), misc. electrical issues, and low voltage lighting for us. I can't ask for a better electric co.!\n\nBy the way, I do think its odd that \""Joe M's\"" review of Dodge Electric is the ONLY review he's ever made."
2,"On our recent one day trip to las vegas we decided to have dinner at this place since we were residing far from the strip blvrd. The menu was very interesting and very confusing, So I let the other order. My favorite was pieces of salmon, and the one with the quail egg.\nIn general the service was really good, super friendly and very fast. Fish was very fresh."
3,"IT WOULD'VE BEEN 5 STARS BUT THE WAITRESS WAS BITCHY AT FIRST!\n\nBeing a HUGE Sex and The City fan, I had to go to this place.  The decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  Red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   The location in Ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  We went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  However, the place got PACKED!  THEY DECIDED TO PUT A ROW OF 6 OR 7 TABLES EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.  YOU CAN HEAR THEIR ENTIRE CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.  Just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nOur visit started out kinda rocky.  Our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? Dont know!  All I do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  So after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  While we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nThe menu is a combination of Pervian, Brazillian and Asian fusion.  OOOOOH SO DIVINE!  IT WAS SO HARD TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO CHOOSE.  We finally decided on Sushi and Seabass, miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso is delicious but I've had better.  My friend ordered the Red Wild mushroom and truffle Miso.  IT WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  But, THE SEAWEED SALAD IS A MUST HAVE TO VEGGIE LOVERS.  Seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  I was so pleasantly surprised.  When to food arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT SUSHI I ORDERED BUT ONE OF THEM THE BEST EVER!  As expected, the food is expensive.   Between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. So don't go here if you are trying to save money.  If you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  But, you will still be hungry.\n\nI loved this place.  With the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  I WILL BE GOING BACK!  I LOVE SUSHI SAMBA!!!!!!!"
1,the salesmen have gotten scuzzier ands lot more pushy. when I leased my car 3 years ago they were wonderful. now they're just like every other car dealer. shame.
0,"As far as I can tell, no longer there."
1,"This location is by far the worst of them all. I have watched the steadily declining food quality and service since they have opened. Our last experience this last time was the kicker. The waitress was a young girl with very little social skills and really needed help with articulation and volume. She had trouble multitasking and lacked attentiveness. But the other servers picked up the slack. So all was good. We ordered gyro, fatoosh and cilantro hummus. Cilantro hummus is always consistent and good. The gyro not so much. The meat was cooked like bacon: crisp, crumbly and almost considered burnt. It had to be sent back. The return food was decent but had some mystery meat wrapped inside that we will assume for our piece of mind was grill bits.  The fatoosh is 3/4 rice, which is awesome if you love rice, not awesome if you are looking for a light flavorful salad that is typical with fatoosh. The kicker, the manager and other servers wiped up tables that were considerably messy that had children seated at them with DRY napkins. No bleach/ disinfectant / wet towels used. And promptly sat another families with children at those tables. Poor quality food, subpar service I can tolerate. Not uncleanliness and poor hygiene. I will visit the other locations."
1,"If this place's prices were 20% less, I would give it 3 or possibly 4 stars.  This review is probably a 2.5, not fully a 2, but I can't go to a 3.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good, but not great meal.  The problem is that it's priced like it's Delmonico, Cut or Carnevino.  And, it ain't those places.  My wife had the special, which was crab stuffed lobster.  The lobster had a strong fishy odor, which indicated to us the lobster was not totally fresh.  Perhaps this was why it was used for the stuffed lobster rather than being steamed and served whole.  She had the filet, which was fine, but not overwhelming and certainly not worth the cost.  I had the ribeye, which again was fine.  Certainly better than your neighborhood Outback, but not worth anywhere near what they charged.  \n\nService was adequate.  The wine list was average I would say, probably decent for downtown.  If you plan on spending this much on a meal, I would recommend Prime, Brand, etc....."
1,"My wife is Korean and found this place for us. Based on Korean blogs and reviews on here, it sounded like a great place.\n\nMy wife and I had great food, unfortunately I can't give 5 stars based only on the food. The service was terrible. I have never been so upset from poor service and I felt like more people should be prepared for this.\n\nWe barely saw our server and as the place started filling up, we noticed them seating people outside who probably would have preferred indoors (late December). We had chosen a booth which was big enough for at least 4 people, because the place was less than half full when we got there. Needless to say we felt bad for the people waiting. We were ready to go but had to wait, while people waiting to be seated looked confused and upset. I'm not saying anyone should rush to give up their seat, but we waited over 15 minutes for the check. Eventually my wife asked a different server for the check which arrived soon after, however, it sat on the table for at least another 5 minutes until I walked it over to their register and paid it. It seemed like the the servers were very disorganized and were covering a lot of the same tables. I'm not a manager but I would say something needs to change."
1,"We were greeted at the door by the owner/hostess who told us her mother was the chef.  We order water and were surprised to have bottleed water served. I was hesitant to order fish because the restaurant was virtually empty at 7:15PM on this Friady night so I opted for the masitas de Puerco that owner recommended.   The only problem was the kitchen was pork free this evening. My next order was pollo asada al ajillo - chicken seasoned and marinated in garlic.  It turned out to be a grilled leg quarter, but I could not discern any garlic or other seasonings.  My wife's pechuga de pollo a la plancha - grilled chicken breast topped with grilled onions was another yawner. Our entrees included rice and fried plantains. We concluded the meal with a very dense flan that was more than decent.  On our bill was a charge for for bottled water that we never requested, but I have since learned this is SOP for this restaurant."
0,Wow people in this store are rude. I was in there exactly 2 minutes and was shocked at how rude the print lady was.  Not gonna go there again.
2,"Don't get me wrong this place is very fancy. I like that they play new and old movies.\n\nYou go to the cashier and you pay for a your ticket and you also get a huge menu for food and drinks. As you continue to walk into the movie theater you will see a huge bar. No one was sitting there, but if you wanted to get wasted before a movie this is your place to go. \n\nYou'll see waiters and waitress walking all around and you find your theater. You walk in and there are rows with huge comfy chairs with a side table that you can put in front of you if you get food or drinks. Don't get me wrong  you definitely get a lot of leg room! However there is one row that is just a row of computer chairs up to a bar table. No one was sitting in front of me, but I can imagine if it was a tall guy/girl I wouldn't have been able to see the screen too well.\n\nWith the Groupon that I got it came with a free drink so I got a strawberry lemonade, It'd order it again. Beside the Groupon we ordered a popcorn which was also good. I know they had a lot of other stuff like chicken and pizza and stuff, but I wasn't there to eat dinner. \n\nYou have servers walking all around through the movie and you just push this little red button if you want something. But you do have to hear talking through the movie if someone decides to order then. \n\nI also must say it was very cold in there! So if you want to get away from the Arizona heat, this is the place for you."
4,"Everyone there is awesome! There's no better place to go from weight loss, hormones, medical and anti aging. Dr. Goldsmith is even board certified in all. I've searched for another clinic like this when they moved and believe me, there is NONE. Worth the drive."
2,"Cheap? No. MASSIVE? Yes. Worth the moderately annoying line? For sure.\n\nBut stick to the dessert crepes. My 'savory' crepe was less than thrilling. That Napoleon (lemon custard, berries, cream) was outta this world. \n\nAlso, an iced coffee with Baileys is an EXCELLENT jumpstart to a day of gambling, in my professional opinion."
1,"Certainly not the best dining experience available at The Wynn.\n\nPro: A nice terrace where you can sit outside and eat with a view of one of the pools.\nCon: Outdoor seating was closed today at lunch, even though there was perfect weather and a gentle breeze.\n\nPro: The setting is nice and even though the place is huge, it feels intimate.\nCon: The service was laughable.  Total rookie camp, which is not the norm at Wynn.  I think our waiter was either on drugs or had a stomach ailment.  He was acting weird and kept disappearing for long stretches of time.\n\nPro: Lovely looking shrimp cocktail.\nCon: I couldn't eat it after witnessing the woman who carried it to our table holding the plate in such a way that the shrimp was actually touching her shirt (right between her armpit and right breast).\n\nPro: Reasonably priced food for being inside a Strip resort.\nCon: My turkey club which is pretty hard to mess up didn't taste good.\n\nPro: Wynn picked up the tab for our table as a comp.\nCon: We could have better spent that money at any other dining establishment on property.\n\nI will not return.  Even room service blows this place out of the water."
0,"I went to this establishment on November 20th, 2012.  I walk in and nobody is standing at the cash register to greet me and ask me for my order.  I had to ask the lady to get somebody to take my order. After I gave my order I waited for 5 minutes and nobody started making my wrap.  Then when I got my wrap it was freezing cold (spicy chick wrap).  It was absolutely disgusting.  And it was close to $8.  Do not go here.  Bad service/Bad food.  Also, the boy making my wrap would not stop staring and laughing at me.  How awkward and unprofessional."
2,This gift shop is super HUGE and has everything. I love that they had moccasins to. But I agree with some of the other reviewers and everything was made CHEAP hence MADE IN CHINA. Wasn't really feeling the things that they had. They were also pretty expensive.
4,"As a long time Mesa resident, I was excited when a friend wanted to take me to her new fave with the weird name. OMG. Please, thai this one on. \nThe Thai toast is so good, with a sweet sauce that comes with making it one of my favorite apps ANYWHERE. \nBest entrees, Evil Jungle Princess, Black Pepper Shrimp, Green Curry, Pad See Ew (sp?) and the Laarb salad. \nGreat service, including sodas that are free refills (not from the fountain!) and good prices make this one of my favorite Mesa eats. Only downside is that there's never enough rice and they make you pay for more..."
4,"Gourmet sandwiches? done and done. this place does not skimp on the toppings.  The Bobby is my fav, with turkey and stuffing and cranberry sauce.  Thanksgiving every time.  Great every time.  Really good, really good service, really high quality product.  I belong to the text club and get free drinks and chips, so its and even better deal.  Love this place for a fast meal."
4,"We recently adopted our dog from my mom-in-law who lives in Casa Grande and I wanted to get Bruno in to see a vet in Tempe. I looked up a few offices and saw this location had an awesome rating. I was pleased to see someone I respect, Shayna K. from Scottsdale Doggie Suites, providing a 5 star rating and that was it. \n\nI immediately decided to make a new patient appointment for my furry baby. The office is clean, the staff is nice, and they made Bruno feel right at home. \n\nDr. Berthiaume came in and was very informative. I think he could tell I was a nervous \""new mom\"" and he helped me stay at ease. He suggested one medication for Bruno which is for heartworm prevention but didn't pressure me into making a purchase right then and there. He gave me a pamplet on it and told me to do some research on my own first. (AMEN!)\n\nWhen I told them about my concern about him scratching his ears a lot, they took swabs but didn't run them. Dr. B. said if he saw anything \""bad\"" he would have ran them for a test but didn't want to charge me for anything Bruno didn't need done. He suggested to have Bruno's stool tested but said we could bring in a sample anytime and they would send it off then. There was NO pressure to have tests done so they could get money out of me. \n\nThey genuinely cared about Bruno and my wallet. I will be going back, this is going to be my dog's doctor, and I appreciate how awesome everyone was. It is so refreshing to find a place that really care about the patients they see and the owners."
2,"I hate paying full price for movies. There's just something wrong with $12 for two hours of people talking into their cell phones, crunching wrappers and sticky floors. But when there's a movie you really want to see and you can't wait a month for it to come out at Redbox, then you're kinda stuck.\n\nPark Terrace is a nice theater with mostly comfortable seats that are well cushioned with drink holders in the arm rests. The seats are \""stadium style\"" so you don't have someone's hair in your sightline and you can focus on watching the movie.\n\nIt's still spendy. At the moment, movies before 3pm (there's one showing) are $7.50 and every other showing is $10. I didn't check out the concessions.\n\nParking is easy and there's plenty to do both before and after the movie. Fuel Pizza is right next door or any of a half-dozen other eateries without having to cross Woodlawn into *that* plaza.\n\nTheir movie choices are usually not the big name films right when they come out and they also have a selection of off-brand indie films that are worth watching."
3,"I really like this place. There is a lot to look through, and there are a lot of cool vendors. Like any antique store, there are some great prices and some inflated prices. There are lots of treasures to be found, so be sure to give yourself adequate time to find them!"
1,"Having read the reviews and checked out the menu and decor in person before deciding on it, I could not have been more surprised to have such a disappointing experience.  \n\nThe wine by-the-glass list is inexplicably short, but the options are decent.  The view of the fountains is great at certain tables.  We were not at one of those tables.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n-  Crispy Eggplant (chef's special appetizer): tasty, but oddly dry.  Served with an overly dusty coating and no sauce.\n\n-  Hot and Sour Soup:  All hot, no sour, with an unwelcome sweetness.  They took it off the bill, though.\n\n-  Kung Pao Chicken:  Bland in taste and texture, with large, flat medallions of tough chicken and super-sweet cashews overpowering any hope of a savory note.\n\n-  Braised Kobe Short Ribs:  Stew meat served on a gelatinous bed of noodles oozing some kind of thin brown liquid.  Tasteless and unappetizing for everyone at the table.\n\nWe were far too disappointed by this point to try dessert.  Plus we were both still hungry, so we left and got chili-cheese fries at Snacks on the casino floor.  Now THOSE were really good!"
0,"The hotdogs are okay, pricing isn't bad, but the guy that was serving me was a douche! I've been to places where the food was good enough to overlook the service... this isn't one of them!"
2,"I'm generally not a fan of waiting in line at clubs (ok, really, I'm not a fan of waiting anywhere. My natural enemy is the line.) but our group was playing things by ear that night and it landed us at Jet. We waited for about 45 minutes or so to get in but I have to say that the line was very well organized and the bouncers were very nice and tried to keep everyone in a good mood. If you are in a group of girls, of course, you can get in much faster. But being that we are nice girls we decided not to ditch our husbands (we are, after all, legally obligated to them once the trip is over) and to wait it out with them. \n\nI had always avoided going to Jet and I could never figure out why. Now having gone there I know. Its just a club. It could be anywhere. There is nothing particularly special about it in any way. I would not get bottle service here, I don't think its necessary at all. There was never a long line for the bar, and it never got to the point where it was so crowded you couldn't move. For the money that you would spend on bottle service here I would suggest you go to Tao or Tryst instead. \n\nThe music in the main room was ok, they did keep switching between pop and classic rock which tends to annoy me as I find it hard to dance to songs like Sweet Home Alabama. I enjoyed the back room where they were playing old school hip hop much, much, more and if I should ever return to Jet I would stay in that room and that room only. However, I'm not sure that I would return as I think Jet is nothing special."
0,"This place needs some serious work. I admire the decor, it looks really hip and fresh, but food wise, this place is way too expensive, and honestly, poor quality. \n\nFAME seems like it's set up to be like a modern Asian Market Place with vendors lined up kind of like a lunch line. There was Fuku Burger at one end of the area, which my friends ended up eating at and said it was pricier than the food truck. I chose to go to the opposite side of the area, where they showcased duck and pork hanging (kind of like Sam Woo BBQ, if anyone is familiar with that restaurant). I ordered the duck and pork combo and switched the rice out for noodles (lo-mein possibly), which came out to $18. While I definitely thought this was way over-priced for something trying to mimic an Asian Market (where prices are cheap as hell, helloooo i.e. Philippines, Thailand, etc), I still gave it a fair shot.  \n\nStill, the quality of food was garbage. I literally saw them microwave the duck. They didn't cut it from the duck hanging in the window, and when the server brought the food to my table, she forgot my utensils and said, \""Oh shoot, I forgot to give you utensils, can you just get them?\"" Smh. Also, the manager scolded one of his workers in front of me for not giving someone a number card, really not professional. \n\nThe food tasted old, not fresh, and the duck was soggy. The pork was reasonable, but definitely not $18 worth. The noodles were so-so, oily, and not very flavorful, and the side vegetables were oily and also not fresh. \n\nIf this place wants to survive, they need to cut prices, work on quality of food, big time, and work on customer service. I was really disappointed with this place, be wary."
4,"Ridiculous Prime Rib cut right at your table, with delicious sides, a great beer selection, and top-shelf service.  This was my first visit, a meeting with some vendor folks, and I was blown away.  I definitely did not expect to like it as much as I did.\n\nI had Mirror Pond Pale Ale, the Lawry's cut, medium, mashed potatoes and creamed corn.  We started with calamari, which was great.  Apparently they had sent back the first calamari, but I didn't notice as I was completely engrossed in conversation, so I'm not dropping from 5 stars.  I ate calamari from the second plate and it was fine.\n\nI'm not huge on red meat, and I probably eat a steak or prime rib a MAXIMUM of a couple times a month.  I'm pretty happy my April binge was spent at Lawry's.  I will be going back."
0,"Knowing nothing about this place other than it looked cute and not too crowded on a Halloween Sunday, we walked in.  Service was prompt from the beginning, though the hostess was a bit abrupt.  Our server, Tiffany, was excellent, thorough and quick to refill a beverage.  The food however, was bland at best and misleading at worst.  We went with the fixed menu (possibly the first mistake) and were very disappointed.  The Caesar salad was bland, but not terrible.  The entrees however, were awful.  I had the lasagna which was fine except that they had evidently layered two slices of american cheese (though white) over the top and had not taken the time to properly melt them.  It really detracted from the taste.  My boyfriend had ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, which came with \""garlic toast.\""  Upon receiving the entree, he asked about the garlic toast.  The server said that it didn't come with the meal.  So we asked our server, Tiffany.  She brought over the menu and when we pointed out the actual words on the menu, she told us that this meant \""toasted garlic in the sauce not garlic bread.\""  She was as friendly as possible about it, but could obviously see our unhappy expressions.   Then, to top it off, dessert arrives--a dessert we ordered on her recommendation.  It was supposed to be a custard topped with strawberries.  The custard came, and the strawberries were missing.  When I asked, she looked embarrassed and said that they had just run out of strawberries.  At that point I was just fed up.  Instead of letting us know that they were out of something so that we could change our order, they tried to serve a half-assed dish and hope that we wouldn't notice.  To compensate us for our \""trouble\"" they took 25% off the bill, which afterwards was still $72.   I think it was highly overpriced, mediocre food, and I will not be returning, nor will I be recommending it."
2,"Pineapple Carrot Cake is very good here. Even after eating it two days later, it was still moist, not ruined with raisins (can't stand cooked raisins, eeewww), and the pineapple really finishes it. I always make my carrot cake with pineapple, so that will always win me over. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=UARGXxOFHv2DM7NZe6Ac-A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=UARGXxOFHv2DM7NZe6Ac-A\n\nIf you stop for the BLT bloody mary on the way home, you can pick up a snack here for the drive. Plenty of desserts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=-aEM8ucFmzvvlVCt8RiaYw, but also sandwiches, scones, coffee, and even gelato! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=Kih_XQhOBdSVZe4ph3oHXQ"
4,"The food was fantastic. Service was unobtrusive. The lamb dish was cooked to perfection, and being. A goat cheese lover, I enjoyed the side that came with it. The ratatouille lasagne was fantastic as well, and I loved the truffle emulsion with it. Dessert - we tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was classic goodness.\n\nI'll be back if possible for the food."
0,"Granted, it's Hooters.  And Hooters in Vegas is ten times worse than anything you can possibly imagine.  However in this economy customer service is essential for a business to thrive.  The valet attendant who simply drove our vehicle and left the car without saying anything to us and didn't offer to assist with luggage made the choice of tip amount simple.  Zero.  Because he didn't even say a word to us as he walked by, presumably to take his smoke break.  \n\nThe pool is open 24/7 all year round, however it's all guys there, and I'd hate to even think of the sperm count contained within.  The only women at that pool are the hooters girls, and they're paid to flirt with you.  You're not that funny.  In fact, watching you from my window I saw most of the waitresses avoiding you after hassling them for your fifth picture and yelling, \""sluts!\""\n\nThe next door neighbors violently vomiting (with the door open?) until 5 am is to be expected in Vegas at a \""red neck haven\"" such as this one.  If you can afford to go somewhere else, do so.  Otherwise, stay home, save your money and buy a pair of shoes.\n\nThat said, the servers were nice.  You have to be respectful to them and you may get the same waitress back to the table more than once.  If you're a d-bag or harassing, it seems they'll send a different one to take over."
2,"I love the vietnamese sandwiches, but the downside is that the bread they use is always hard . So when I take bites I take hard chews of all bread and end up eating most of the meat last. Their bread is good, tasty, and soft when it's fresh. I wish they would serve the freshest bread for the sandwiches too! Their thai tea boba is deliscious! Milky, smooth, and sweet! Just the way I like it. They also have free wifi and a very contemporary feel to the interior decoration. \n\nIf you're looking to get a kick start on vietnamese lingo, I'd suggest to hang out at this spot and learn about the numbers in vietnamese! Their service machine calls out your ticket in english and vietnamese! So when you're hanging around lee's definitely count with the service machine, and I guarantee you you'll be a vietnamese counting guru with in minutes!"
1,"So I came in last night with my boyfriend & mom...\nI ordered 2 vodka/sprites & a rum & diet coke at the bar & then decided to take a table since one had just opened up.\nWhen our waitress came we ordered one platter (samples of everything; chicken tenders, zucchini, jalapeno poppers, a couple other things..) and pita & hummus dish for my mom.\nWhen she came with the food, she asked if we had ordered a sample platter at the bar before sitting down, because it was showing that we had ordered a total of TWO sample platter & the humus dish. I said no... We didn't order ANY food at the bar.. And she kind of made it seem like I might have been lying & that we did order the meal at the bar,\n1. why would I order two?\n2. Why would I lie about it?\nAnyway she asked who I ordered from at the bar, a male or female & that she would go talk to them about it.\nI saw her talking to the bartender.\nWhen she came back by she didn't say anything so I asker her if it got straightened out. She said yeah, it's fine.\nIt was stupid because she made a big deal out of it. She could have just said \""okay, there must have been a mistake.\"" & told the kitchen not to make 2. But she argued with me about it a little bit. How rude. She probably just wrote that we ordered 2 on the ticket on accident and seems like she didn't want to own up to her mistake. Or she genuinely didn't think she wrote our ticket wrong & that she surely could not have made a mistake.\nAnyway, we got our check, and we were being charged for BOTH fricken platters!!\nObviously another mistake.\nShe took it off after we told her it was still on our ticket.\nShe was just kind of rude, not very happy. Took kind of a long time. It was a little busy but nothing crazy! I do like Hazelwoods but was just kind of like WTF about that whole situation... \nOur food was delicious though & the vodka/sprites were good.\nFair prices too. Which is good because I would have given the rating something as shitty as that waitress' attitude.\nMy other experiences have been pretty good here though."
1,"I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip."
4,This place is wonderful! We had a cast party there. The woman refilling our appetizers just overheard my friend ask if there was anything I could eat (because I'm vegetarian) and she immediately said she would bring out some vegetarian appetizers. They did the lettuce wraps and quesadilla vegetarian and they  were delicious and had a vegetarian protein source (cashews in the lettuce wrap).
2,"Great Pedicure! First time trying this place out, getting out of work. Searched on yelp for a close by nail salon and found this. They don't talk at all. Especially my nail tech lady. Didn't even greet me, but I'm not a talker either. She gave me a relaxing massage on my feet, liked it. As soon as she finished polishing my nails she just walked away and didn't say a word. She was just not in the mood to talk to me I guess. Overall it's an alright place if you're near by and in need of a pedi after work like me. Probably won't visit this place again though."
1,"I could have stayed at the previous bar to see how much I could drink as fast I can, but I heard you make irrational decisions when drinking whiskey. Hence going to Mulligan's.\n\nThursday nights are perfect if you don't want to wait 20 minutes for a drink, make friends with the bartenders and try to pick-up 5.658s.\n\nAlso, they have Happy Hour from 5-9..1/2 off well drinks.... meh."
2,"Cowbody Ciao has been on my list of places to try for quite some time. Tucked away down a side street in Old Town Scottsdale, for years it has been \""out of sight, out of mind\"" for me, until a few weeks ago when we stumbled across it on a walk through the town. The atmosphere left a little to be desired, but the food was light and delicious! \n\nWe weren't terribly hungry, so we decided to give the famous stetson chopped salad a try. While it was delicious, when most people think chopped salad they picture lettuce. The chopped was the only salad on the menu without a description, and so when a bowl of mainly cous cous arrived, we were surprised. It was delicious, but not what we expected. \n\nFor a unique menu with a southwestern flair, definitely give Cowboy Ciao a try."
0,"the nail place looks clean, but you can never get any service done.  The owner tells you to make an appt even though they say walk ins are welcome.  When you have an appt with a specific manicurist they still make you wait 1 1/2.  You then decide to not make an appt and get there a few minutes before they actually open, you are told to come back in an 1 1/2.  There are a ton of manicure places in a 1 mile radius that would be thrilled to have the business and do a good job.  My time is too valuable to either sit around waiting with an appt or drive back in the same day and wait."
1,"Part of the buffet of buffets promotion, this buffet is a slightly upgraded hometown buffet but if you go during peak hours, you will wait ~2hrs as we did for a party of 2. I would recommend passing on this location as all the meats were dry, they did not have enough people cleaning tables so that was the main reason there was a huge backup in the line, and overall the variety was above average but the quality was sub par. At least I didn't get food poisoning?"
1,"\""One Of My Least Favorite\""\nI generally aim for the more upscale casino's to not only gamble at but to also stay inside the hotel as well. I find these type of low budget casinos to be a bit past outdated and I guess for anybody who is on a budget that likes ancient egyptian theme's should opt for the Luxor!"
3,"Great place to visit while in Charlotte. I saw it on \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" so figured we'd give it a try, great choice!"
3,"I have eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed the food.  However, I come here mostly for the Campfire Smores shake ( alcohol infused).  I really don't taste too much alcohol in any of their shakes, but they are quite delicious.  \n\nThe Rising Sun burger is very good as well as the Hen house."
0,"Was quoted a price of $150.00 to fix a speeding ticket and paid it in full.  Weeks later received a letter stating that I owed an additional $145.00.  Ticket was $255.00 so I saved a total of $5.00.  Total misrepresentation, you can't quote one price and then weeks later send another bill paid directly to the court.  Woman in office Aurora lied through her teeth about the cost and when questioned after the fact said that the original $150.00 paid for the scaled Lawyer to go to court for you.  While there were no points or traffic school on the account, the additional money paid to the court should have been quoted up front instead of letting people \""assume\"" it was the final cost.  Total bullshit.  Don't use this crook."
3,"Ok I took one star away cause it was ridiculously crowded, but then again i guess that's really good for most. anyway this place is hugeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! upstairs downstairs middle room here room there. I think this might be one of the hardest to get into, maybe not so much for girls. anyway so we got in cause we knew someone, upstairs is beautiful, we didn't pay for drinks but i think it costs like 12 or more per drink, Britney and diddy and other were right next to us, but then again it was the vma's, but anyway , if u can get in its funnnnnnnnnnnn. I went with amel, 2nd girl below me!"
2,I like the food at buffalo ww and our service had always been great. They serve coke zero which is a plus to me. They've let us sample sauces before ordering which leads me to trying new things although I always get naked wings with side salad. Surprisingly not too bad calorie wise.  The reason i don't go here more often is it is so loud. I understand its s sports bar so that's on me but it could come down a notch at least when its not a big game.
4,"Thus is not only a great espresso bar in Montreal it's probably one of the best I've been to ever -- great espresso drinks and the best, fluffiest peach scone I believe is on the planet! A definite stop"
2,"The service could use some improvement.  This restaurant is understaffed and unable or properly handle peak times.  We were told there is no wait, but  ended up waiting for 20 minutes for a table.  Proper service at the bar is also lacking.\n\nOn the bright side, the beer selection is good and the food is pretty tasty.  If you're willing to wait and don't mind poor service, give this place a try."
1,"We had a 3 night stay here that was part of a promotion.\nWe expected a nice hotel with the name being well known.\nWe had an upgrade, which was probably good. Our room was ok. The biggest complaints were no coffee in the room. Together a cup in the morning I had to go to a coffee shop in the lobby and pay $3.75 for a \nlarge cup. The TV stations were very limited too \nThe lobby area, casino and restaurants did not thrill us. I had one breakfast here that was just fair. Service was slow.\nIf you are booked to stay here by a promotional company make them out you into another hotel. CheckYelp, it is right more then wrong.\n\nNeedless to say, this will be our last visit here"
3,"Solid 4 stars!\n\nIs nice to get away from the strip if you're there for an entire week!!! The ambiance here is great! Very calm and the service is great. \n\nThey are so high tech! The waiter took our orders with his iphone and it was submitted into the kitchen! He said the owner created an app. Genius!  \n\nYou can never go wrong with Tikka Masala!! We came here for dinner with a party of five. No buffet--a la carte. \n\nWe ordered an assortment of dishes, but my favorite was the tikka masala with garlic naan. \n\nI also ordered the peach lassi, which was pretty good. It tasted like a peach yoplait! hahaha\n\nOh, I forgot to mention, but they have a GREAT, extensive selection of alcoholic beverages!!!"
3,It's a great place to shop if you have a lot of money to drop.\nTheir stores are always stocked with the hippest and most current fashion pieces!\nI bought my prom dress at the BCBG here and I loved it!\nIt was a bit pricey but it was well worth the money.\nI also love their Betsey Johnson store here.\nTheir staff is always very helpful and the dresses are amazing!
2,"(Lyrics - U2 - With or Without You)\n\nSee the foodies in your place\nSmell your food twist in the air\nI'll wait for you\n\nEat with hands and share a plate\nOn a bed of Injera I'll taste\nAnd I try Cafe Lalibela\n\nCafe Lalibela.....\nCafe Lalibela........\n\nEthiopian food in PHX!? Well this dude had to try it out for sure!  Cafe Lalibela has had the reputation of being one of the best vegetarian restaurants in town, but they also serve meals with meat too.  \n\nCame here with my foodie buddies on a Tuesday night.  The place was pretty seemly on a Tuesday night!  Once we walked in the first thing that hit me was the aroma of the food.  Smelled pretty darn tasting if you were asking me and we couldn't wait to start!  \n\nAs we sat I ordered  a beer.  I wanted to order the Ethiopian Coffee served in a clay pot, but boy it was a late Tuesday night and didn't want to keep myself up all night!  You could order family style or individual plates here.  If you go with the family style you will be dipping into your meals with other people sharing with you.  I felt uncomfortable with that so I shared my entree with my gal pal; we ordered the Meat Combination and Kitfo.  Truthfully, if you asked me how to pronounce some of the ingredients I couldn't, but the meat combination came with beef, lamb, and pork in different kinds of colored sauce.  Unfortunately, there's really no explanation of some of what we were eating.  The Kitfo was under-cooked or raw beef depending on how you liked it and in the end I didn't really care for it in general.  The red sauce mixed with it had a hint of spice, but didn't really care over much flavor.  The Meat Combination was okay at best, but nothing to amazing in my books.  Just saucy meat you ate with Ethiopian bread called Injera.  \n\nIn the end, the experience was fun and the service was good.  The ambiance was lacking since I expected much more decors and flair to make you feel the culture and the food. - Enjoy!"
2,"Food is nothing to brag about, in fact it is over priced. I have been in there a couple of times and always feel like we are a bother to the staff, as if we don't belong."

1,"I have tried to like this place, I really want to, but after my second time here I won't be going back.  The food is good and they have decent beer on tap, that's why they get two stars, but the service is AWFUL.  You should not have to wait 10 minutes for someone to take your drink order, especially when it isn't busy and when the Suns are playing you should have that on TV, not hockey."

1,"2 stars is being generous. 1 star is for a great location in Old Montreal and the other star is because my wife likes their salt and pepper chicken wings.\nIt fails at being a sports bar.

How much is a plain ole Pastrami sandwich....\n\nI asked if the cole slaw, which not included, was creamy or more vinegary...he didnt know how to answer that....  am I asking a strange question here?\n\nThis is supposed to be a deli....cole slaw is typical deli fare.... if I ask what kind...tell me, describe it to me... I am not there and cannot see it, nor did I have access to the internet to look.\n\nSeveral of us from work ordered together and none of us got our \""complimentary\"" pickle slice nor did they include the other condiments we requested.\n\nWe're talking 10 bucks for a regular sandwich....I deserve the darn pickle! lol\n\nI didnt bother to call and have a little chat as the person who had the priviledge of picking up the order mentioned the \""old man\"" we are guessing the owner? Was a grump and not the friendliest of people....so..... here I am, sharing my experience with others.\n\nI do not mind paying $10.00 for a sandwich but that sandwich better be packed with meat....or 14k gold shavings!\n\nOk, maybe it was lunch time and busy....or maybe someone was in a bad mood...or maybe the young kid just started and simply wasent fimilar with their product.... I dont know, nor do I care .....\n\nI am not getting what I paid for and that SUCKS!\n\nSo here's the 25 thousand dollar question....will I return?\n\nNope...not a chance!  \n\nI can get around the unfriendly employees and the lack of knowledge of their own menu but I will NOT pay $10.00 for a sandwich with 1/2 the meat that should be there.....\n\nI will find another good pastrami sandwich or I will wait until I visit New York again.\n\nThere may be some die hard Pastrami lovers out there who simply must have good pastrami regardless of price and to them I say... \""go for it\"".\n\nBut not this girl!  I feel I should get what I pay for and this was NOT worth the price!\n\nAgain, I can only compare it to other Deli's here in the Phoenix area or since they advertise it to be \""NY pastrami\"" I compare it to a Pastrami sandwich you get in ANY N.Y deli and GANDOLFO's looses.\n\nSo, with that being said...give it a try and see what you think.....and until you do.....\n\nBon Appetite'"
3,"I went here after seeing this restaurant featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Drives.  I wasn't quite sure about the mixture of Mexican and Chinese food...but I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is a little confusing, but the girl at the counter was helpful in explaining it.  There was plenty of food and it was tasty!.....One of my creations was the carnitas in a quesadilla.......Mmmmmmm.....try it out!!!!!"
1,"If Stoney Creek were a mechanics shop, they would certainly be the dealership. Although they are extremely competent and seem to be very good vets, they are very expensive and constantly trying to sell vaccines and checkups and all kinds of other services I don't need. They are also not very flexible. I had a Saint Bernard who got bit by a brown recluse (we think) and the skin turned black over night and began falling off of the leg and rotting. I rushed him to Stoney Creek and they originally refused to see him without an appointment (next day was the earliest). I found this, along with their lack of concern, to be really disconcerting. However, besides that one situation, they typically seem to care. They're also very expensive. They quoted a simple neutering at $350 while my other, equally competent vet in Winston Salem, quotes $150."
1,"I'm not an Alice Cooper fan, but was brought to Alice cooper'stown by a group of coworkers.  We were greeted by a host who was definitely dressed the part, as were all the waitresses.  The restaurant is fairly dark and dingy inside despite the lovely Phoenix sun that could be shining in from the outdoors.   \n\nThe service was really slow, and it took a long time between when we ordered and when the food arrived.  I chose the fish tacos, and the fish was overly deep fried, and tasted a but like everything that had been in the fryer.  I didn't really enjoy them at all.\n\nA few people at my table got the brisket, and comments were made about how dry it was, and how it lacked flavour that should be expected of brisket.\n\nIs restaurant seems like it is really gimmicky, however, I'm sure Alice Cooper fans probably appreciate it!"
3,Love me some $5 burgers. And the wine selection is great
3,"I loooooved the Phoenix location, so when it closed I was really disappointed and made a note to try this one to see if it could take it's place. Today I did. The place was packed with a lunch crowd as the one in Phoenix always was. Very busy, a bit loud.  I ordered the Golden Shrimp appetizer, and the Drunken Noodle with Chicken, both of which I frequently got at the other location. The breading on the shrimp was a bit too fried (not burnt but very dark) and greasy, the sweet dipping sauce was good and helped make up for that. I love flavorful food...the Drunken noodle was good, but the noodles and veggies were cooked a tad too long also and lacked the flavor I desire. This is being critical, cause once you get spoiled...you get spoiled! The food was good, but definitely not outstanding like the Phoenix location had been. I will probably go back here and try a few more dishes, but I will also be looking for that perfect/\""favorite\"" Thai place as my go to. I don't think this is one I will crave! :)"
4,"This review is specifically for the graveyard craps dealer team:  Joe C, Jeff K, Jon H., Hee Chi, and Mike Angelo.  We are regular craps players, living locally in Henderson.  We have played almost everywhere.  This particular team of dealers was by far the best group we have ever come across.  They work together seamlessly efficient, while maintaining an approachable, yet professional atmosphere.  They were welcoming and pleasant.  The thing that stood out the most for us was their  comradery and supportive team dynamic.  This, we have seen nowhere else.  Thank you, guys for a great experience. We will be back."
0,0 STARS. This dairy queen is horrible. The employees do not know how to do their job. Completely disorganized and not clean. It took three employees to ring my order up. Corporate needs to review this shit hole of a store.
1,"OK so your a noodle place...I did not see one sign of making the noodles or do they.? Had chicken lo mein but did not see the chicken I asked and was told its there.....Oh really   sure it is... And that and a  million dollars and you will win the Lotto.As I tasted the bowl of noodles there was a strong vinegar taste . Not sure if I have ever had Lo mein that had a Vinegar taste  still trying to figure that one out.\n            Maybe pickles got dropped in the noodles?As you can see not many people for lunch but, there was a long line next door at Zaxbys?The King of fast food HUH?"
3,"A little pricey but what do you expect--you're on the Strip.\n\nThe food and service were excellent. If you find yourself there and not craving a burger, you'd do fine with the Soba Chicken Salad."
4,"I tore my meniscus, could hardly walk, and was told by a couple doctors and many people that I would need surgery-- I decided I wanted to try the physical therapy route instead, and after only about a month of PT with these guys, my knee pain was completely gone, I was walking normally again, and I was back to running, working out, and playing basketball again...only with stronger legs then before I started physical therapy! It was awesome to get the physical therapy on the acute injury, but then also get strength training to help strengthen the muscles around the injury to make sure that: a) the injury healed, and b) the injury didn't come back! The knowledge that this facility practices with is impressive and comforting, and the staff really is fun to be around. They really work hard and care about each client, and make sure that you get the most out of every visit to their place. And finally, the education that they give you regarding your injury and care plans for you to take home are almost worth as much as the PT itself! Great staff, great service...I would definitely recommend this place to anyone with an injury that PT could help!"
0,"This place had such good reviews so I was excited. And then very disappointed. The room itself was nice (If you ignore the dent in the wall by the bed and stain on the chair). And it was cool that we got to use the MGM pool (after walking a mile but that is just MGM in general.) But that is where my happiness stopped. This place is expensive and a high star-rated hotel- I expect excellent service because of it. I couldn't check in early (despite the fact that when I booked it they told me I could for a fee), fine- that's life I'll wait at the pool till check-in.  Then I had to wait in line to check my bags with the bell hop. Then at check-in I had to wait in another 30 min. line to check-in (if you are that full- have more people there to help!!) Then to continue my day full of waiting- I had to wait another 45 mins for the bell hop to bring my bags up to me while I sit in my wet bathing suit and wanting to shower but have nothing to change into.  The valet took about 20 mins to get my car, and they clearly parked it in the hot sun not in a garage, because it was hot when we got it. I didn't get the promised VIP tickets to the clubs I was supposed to receive. I didn't get the corner room I was promised at the desk. And the employees were all very snickety instead of polite and helpful. When spending money at a luxury hotel, I expect luxury results. I will not be staying here ever again."
4,"I have been to this establishment numerous times. I have tried their pizza compared to others and I keep going back. The crust is amazing, chewy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. Just how I adore it. Their pizza with only mushrooms is my go to favorite. I also like the buffalo chicken.  I have not had a bad pie here. Joey and Victor are always in a good mood, kidding around, having fun. They like what they do. The atmosphere is always uplifting.  So I will continue to drive the 15 miles from my house to the Pizza Company to get my fix."
0,"I can't rate the food - the people at the counter were so rude to me that I decided to leave before ordering.  \n\nIs this part of the \""Essence\"" of this place?"
2,"We returned after several months and we're really surprised how slow they were for a Saturday.  The menu has changed and they didn't have the Poblano Queso we used to order so that was a huge disappointment. Also my husband had to order at least 3 different beers because they had just \""ran out\""."
1,"The waiting area as you come in by the hostess was nice and well decorated. The hostess was welcoming and friendly; sitting at the bar the bartender asked if I wanted a drink and I mentioned about a drink I tried elsewhere to see if he has heard of it. He didnt but offered if I could find the ingredients online he would attempt to make the drink himself. I looked it up on my phone and showed him the ingredients and his version was pretty good as well. Entering the dining area was a surprise as it was a lot smaller then I anticipated. It can make for an intimate dining experience but also falls to increased background noise due to its small size. The table was nice and presented well; the staff seated us and pulled the chairs out as well as placing the napkins on our laps. Dining as a vegetarian for this meal was challenging as the menu did not have many vegetarian choices but the waiter helped out and created vegetarian dishes from what was on the menu. The presentation of all the dishes were good; the food itself was good from the chilled pea soup, to the salad and vegetarian risotto. It just wasnt great; it all tasted good but I was not blown away by it. The desert was probably the best part of the meal as it had a unique presentation and tasted delicious. Overall the dining experience went well, nicely decorated, comfortable seating, good wait staff but I just felt as something was missing that didnt make it a great dining experience."
1,"If you're going to go out, spend some money, don't go here. I've wanted to want to really want to like Samba. But after a few years and consistent gut rot afterwards, I'm going to retire this place from my list of options. Their Groupon deal is restrictive too so be careful! (doesn't include Fri or Sat). Meat quality and selection has waned in recent years, and... well, blah."
0,"There was nothing I liked about this club. My friends and I came here after recieving wristbands in the Sugar Factory. We when we arrived  They seem to be a bit unorganized. Or the line is way long. Entrance and exit is by stairs. This seems lazy, but for those that are in heels and have been dancing the night away, an elevator or escalator would be nice. When I asked if there was an elevator, the guy told me for it's for handicapped. The place is tiny. The area they call the dance floor is packed with people. I've been here twice and never plan on going back again."
1,"The only + is that it is open 24 hours, other than that your paying way too much for yet another mediocre phoenix based sandwich shop"
4,Angie and Whitney were amazing!!! We got our makeup done for a night out in Vegas and could not be happier with the makeup and how sweet both Angie and Whitney were. We will definitely be calling them again the next time we are in vegas! Highly recommend them!
2,"This place is a Very good, affordable thai food right next to the Palms. When they say something is spicy they are not kidding. Everything we had was very good, intense flavor. Nice change of pace to the flood of higher end places all over Vegas"
3,"I love staying at planet hollywood! The beautiful yet modern decor, the helpful staff, and the free bottle of alcohol also helped. Here are a few plus about the PH resort... \n\nRooms - Each room has a movie theme. We stayed in the Universal Solider room. My friends got to stay in the James Bond Room. Nice room with a big bathroom\n\nShopping- All my favorite stores... bebe, urban outfitters, H&M. \n\nRestaurants- Good solid  buffet in vegas. There is also Koi, Strip Steak, \nPH Cafe. There are also lots of choice in the mall\n\nPool - Private Pool for Hotel Guest only so its not too crowded. They also have beer pong tables."
4,"I'm from the Bay Area and was on a weeklong trip. On my way out of Death Valley I had only planned on passing through Vegas. However, I blew a fork seal on my R1100S and it was pretty bad. I rolled into the service center Friday afternoon around 3pm. These guys rock! They did everything they could to help me out. I had brand new fork seals on both forks by 5:30pm. \nBoth the tech and service writer were very friendly and helpful.\nI walked around the dealership and looked around while I waited, it's a pretty nice dealership! \n\nThe cost of labor and parts was very competitive. \nFor those of you who complain about the price... it is not THAT bad! It's also not a Hyosung! What? You think an oil change is gonna cost you $20?! You get quality parts, service and product. In my opinion it is well worth it! \n\nIf I was local, I'd service my BMW at this facility any time!"
0,"Spoke to a nice lady on the phone. Drove halfway across town to purchase a bike. When I got there, the lady wasnt there, instead it was her husband.  She was going to give me 10% off, but the husband would only honor that if I was military or ex-military...a complete waste of my time!  Owner was rude! I would recommend staying away from this place...I just noticed that bikeshops.mtbr.com has similar reviews of this place going back to 2008...those reviews are dead on!"
3,"Also known as the Penalty Box. Best place to go if you want to be full and hammered for approximately $10. It's more than a dive bar! Food and drink specials every night. My favorite specials are the hamburger, tacos at $0.25 a piece, and pirogues at 15 cents a piece. Aside from the food they have a variety of cheap and craft beer, well below even the Pittsburgh drink average. Bartenders are super nice and let you have the remote to the tv. I used to watch a lot of law and order SVU here. \nEvery once in a while someone will be drunk and accidentally take your drink or offer you some coke.. Other than that his place has gotten me through so many rough times and I am grateful for its existence! I hope it never closes or changes. A true gem!"
1,"This was uhm... interesting. We had friends come down to visit us from Michigan and we were looking for someplace decent to eat and planned on going to a strip club afterwards... went to tix4tonight and came across Treasures-50% entrees, free admission to stripclub, and free limo! We figure sure why not! its everything in one, plus a free limo! The restaurant and strip club were in one building, but the restaurant part took over half of the building and the stripclub was in the other half.The food was alright, but it was weird trying to eat, and strippers kept walking by to get to the table behind us (im assuming a bachelor party maybe?) I dont exactly enjoy eating with naked ladies in my presence haha but hey, I guess some guys enjoy that. No regrets though, it was an interesting experience. checked out the stripclub for a little bit after food, but it wasnt that great at all. We left pretty quick."
1,"Good food - straightforward, good fresh local ingredients, non chi-chi plates, and a very nice space in a great neighborhood. \nHOWEVER, after my 3rd visit, I decided that the food wasn't good enough to make me want to put up with the *abominable* service.  No more E2 for me: I've had enough of the waiters with attitude (one nice guy - none of the others were anything but extremely rude), hostess who makes it clear what an honor it is that she is paying any attention to you, and whomever answers the phone should be fired - she scares the customers away."
3,"I had a ticket to see Cirque du Soleil's O this evening, which is at the Bellagio. \n\nI had supper at Fix Restaurant & Bar, which is also in the Bellagio.\n\nI was seated in the front near the open area.  It was great for people watching but since it's close to the slot machines and people are allowed to smoke in the casino, I could smell cigarettes and cigars :(\n\nI wasn't overly hungry so ordered wings.  There were 13 in my order (they were all drummettes) and they were excellent!  The sauce had just the right amount of heat and they were really tender and juicy.  I'd get them again. \n\nMy servers were very attentive and friendly and I was well taken care of."
4,Eastfield Bar and Grill has a very friendly staff. Yummy food. My family loves the chicken fingers. Clean.
2,I've stayed at the Planet Hollywood twice now I give this place an honest review.\n\nRooms: Besides the fact that there was a HUGE wet spot on the floor of our room when we first entered...nothing special. The bathroom is large (which is nice for the ladies) and there's a tub to fill with ice and put your bottles of alcohol in. I know you do it...\nParking: SUPERRRR far from the actual hotel! UGH!!!!\nPool: HORRIBLE! So small and plain! Yuck. You need a room key to get in by the way.\nService: Sloowww! And for some reason they always seem to hang up on you or make you wait forever.\n\nWhen it comes to picking hotels in the summer I look for 2 things: Location & pool.\nPlanet Hollywood has a horrible pool so...next time I would skip this place.
2,"It'll do. And I could practically conclude my review right there with \""It'll do\"". When you're hungry and down on Fremont, it'll do. When it's 3:00am, it'll do. When you're staying at The D, it'll do. When you want a hot dog, it'll do. So yeah, it'll do. It's not great. It's not bad. It'll do.\n\nThis is a 24-hour spot located in The D (formerly Fitzgerald's). It's accessible from both inside The D, as well as directly off Fremont St. And this means you'll no doubt see some interesting characters in here.\n\nThe hot dogs aren't cheap (just under $4), but they're far from expensive. The dogs themselves are good and a better quality than the cheapie ones you find at other Fremont spots. The chili is alright. Cheese doesn't come on it unless you ask. The fries are completed average. You get a decent portion of them. They also serve gyros. But why get a gyro from a hot dog place?\n\nBottom line, it'll do."
4,"Why do you think you are entitled to be head judge of the best cooking competition on tv?  \n\nWhat gives you the right to chastise the contestants over every minute detail?\n\nWhat contributions have you made to this world that make you worthy of even sitting at the same panel as the gorgeous padma and very underrated gail?\n\n**take my first bite of my dry-aged bone-in medium rare rib-eye**\n\nok...you're good....you're really good...you're light a cigarette while sprawled across the trashed bed in my boxers smiling so wide my cheeks hurt GOOD!!! (and i dont even smoke!!)\n\nAfter the first bite I let out an oh so inappropriate but oh so fitting moan and every muscle in my body relaxed and I slouched down in my chair like I was 15 again and back in my friend's guest bedroom feeling like I was on top of the world. \n\nEverything was impeccable-the sides of mushrooms, asparagus, corn, potatoes, the wine, the service and decor but ALL PALED in comparison to that preposterously perfect piece of meat that I devoured unrelentingly. \n\nYou just answered all the critics who said you \""couldnt win the big one\"" by engineering a picturesque 91 yard drive in 1:34 going 11-11 passing capping it all off with a perfect pass down the seam into the heart of the Tampa 2 to your TE who falls into the end zone with 00:00 showing on the clock.\n\nYou, my friend, are a god amongst men.\n\nWait...come to think of it, the line cook who prepared my steak is a god, youre still just a pretentious douche. \n\nAnd youre bald.  hahaha...im so clever."
1,The smells are wonderful.  Cannot wait to taste!  The employees are not to friendly at first. They seemed impatient when were we trying to decide on what to order.  Hope the food is outstanding to make up for the employees.\nWell sorry to say the pizza was old. We ordered a pepper and egg sandwhich and that was good.
4,"I arranged my shuttle service via the Internet.  They were prompt, friendly, the van was clean and cool.  They helped me with my bag.  I enjoy the Super Shuttle and have used them several times.  Really enjoy setting up the pickup via the Internet.  I can pay for the trip and the tip, so I don't need to worry about money when I'm getting dropped off!  Convenient!"
1,"We were a party of five looking for a light meal.  Several of us initially selected the happy hour special of soup and grilled cheese, but the tomato bacon soup apparently is very spicy, which didn't appeal to members of my party. When we looked closer at the menu, it appeared that a lot of the dishes involved a lot of peppers...and a lot of goat cheese. \n\nAnyway, I took advantage of the happy hour beer specials, but unfortunately I really hated the second beer (something by Deschutes that I think might have been skunked). Our server disappeared for the first of several times; another server ended up getting me a different drink.\n\nTwo members of my group ordered quesadillas, one chicken and one steak; when the runners brought one to the table, they said, \""here's a chicken quesadilla...or steak, I don't really know,\"" and plopped it down. My squash spaghetti arrived several minutes after everyone else's dishes. My dish was underwhelming: the goat cheese (of course!) was congealed in clumps (as one might have expected), the sauce was very oily, and the dish had no discernible seasoning. \n\nAfter we had finished, our plates lingered for far too long. Once we received the check, we actually never saw our initial server again, having to flag down another server to get our credit card processed.\n\nI'm not really sure what this place is going for. At the price point for dinner, the food and service need to be much better than it is."
0,"A bar that charges you $15-$45 to get in and won't allow you to take pictures, but then charges you $20 a photo? FAIL"
4,"Great hotel.\n\nStaff was all super friendly and/or helpful. Upgraded to an executive room. The price was very far, and the room was big and clean.\n\nAlso, continental breakfast was included with the room."
0,"Is there a negative number for review?\n\nHad a horrible experience in this bar/restaurant today.  I went in with my African American friend.  As we entered the bar, the waitress (Erica) and the bartender ignored us.  When my friend finally asked if we should seat ourselves, the bartender told us to seat ourselves.  We stood there for approximately 10 minutes filming the waitress as she turned her back and rolled her eyes.  Sure enough, the nasty girl - Erica, was our waitress.  She came to our table and rolled her eyes while askiing if we wanted something to drink.  When we asked why she turned her back and why she did not greet, she claimed that people (at 3:00 in the afternoon) come in and leave, so she did not need greet us.  When we asked for another waitress, she refused.  We ultimately decided to leave.  \n\nTHE ONLY THING I CAN SURMISE IS THAT ERICA AND THE BARTENDER ARE RACIST SINCE ALL OF THE EURO AMERICAN PATRONS WERE BEING TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.  IF YOU CARE ABOUT JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS DO NOT GO.  BOYCOTT THIS BAR. \n\nIt is a horrible place."
3,"Great sushi, I really haven't had anything else, I've been twice for lunch.  Very wide range of rolls to choose from, and the sashimi love boat is amazing!  Reasonably priced, clean, great service; highly recommended."
1,"Came in with a group of six for lunch on a Sunday. Four arrived on-time; we were waiting on two to arrive, but were seated immediately.\nSubmitted our order to the waitress approximately 5-10 minutes after being seated.\n\n1. Pork and egg congee\n2. Dandan noodles\n3. 2x sichuan beef noodle soup\n4. dumpling noodle soup\n5. Beef (and peas) over rice with an over-easy egg\n6. Chicken Congee (to go)\n\nConclusions:\n*Food as a whole was delicious, but not particularly outstanding.\n*Service was not timely, and some dishes arrived as some of our friends finished theirs. (Namely the sichuan beef noodle soup)\n*Expect typical exorbitant Las Vegas mark-up on food. (Especially the dimsum)\n*Restaurant was very clean and provided a good seat for watching the big screens for sports betting."
0,"Imagine, a brewpub without its own brews! How quaint! How.....stupid. We laughed this one up as yet another Las Vegas scam, however unintentional.   No reason to go here.  Not one."
4,"this shop is 100% fantastic!!! \n\nmy friend and i made the trip out from the strip after she raved about the fresh turkey sub she'd had with her husband a year ago. besides some really roundabout directions, the trip was definitely worth the short drive out from the main strip! \nreasons to make your way out to this shop:\n-the turkey is roasted fresh every day and melts in your mouth!\n-during the time we were there, people from NY, Philly, California, and Texas came by, put the philly sandwich to the test, AND loved it!\n-Ruth is one of the sweetest people i met and makes you feel like you're family! \n\nRuth, BEST 12 inches i've ever had!!! ;)"
3,"Now and again I like to mix things up with the chain coffee shops, and here say now I felt like doing just that.\n\nAs CN has moved into the fort, I thought i give this shiney, squeaky new baby a whirl.  \n\nIt's almost like the actual building was made for this purpose.  It has a great mezzanie, which gives massives of height to the front of the store.  Plenty of seating, although it looks like it can get pretty full very quickly.\n\nStaff were pretty friendly too, although behind the counter for them it looks ergonomically a tight squeeze serving us customers going back and forward.\n\nI had a toasted panani with mozzerella and grilled peppers and milano hot chocolate - I just would like the hot chocolate to be full if request no cream and hotter than it was with or without cream.  Coffee is ok too.  \n\nNice change to sbux or costa and a nice addition to the fort."
3,"A delightful surprise. Small setting with funky, comfortable surroundings. Friendly staff, excellent Fentiman's ginger beer, fresh spring mix with good balsamic vinaigrette, salami and roasted veggie sandwich. Just the thing for lunch."
4,"A stunning journey of sound, history, and legacy, Michael Jackson ONE certainly lives up to the expectations of diehard MJ fans. The music is authentic, the production is delicate, and the theme is a triumph. This is a must-see from Cirque du Soleil when you hit Vegas. \n\nThe music is impeccable; every single sound comes from MJ and his work. Imagine MJ's original voice recording on IMAX quality output. It feels as if you were listening to him live. \n\nThe theme is a triumph: extolling the king, embodiment of the immortal. This is shown by the arrangement: no one can singly represent the King. It is the culmination of the entire cast and audience that renders MJ's presence.  We are the same, we are ONE. \n\nThe symbolism of MJ's glove, hat, and socks is empowering, because the objects represent the legacy that is visible to the eyes and tangible to the touch. I really love it.  \n\nYou will notice the original dance moves are shown last in the choreography of each song. Instead of presenting a blatant imitation, the choreography gracefully conveys the message, \""We want to dance like the King.\"" Creativity and freshness dance on stage. \n\nInterestingly, there is also the element of rebuttal against the media. On the injustice of social media, I cannot empathize more with MJ. I was glad the show touches on that aspect of MJ's life. \n\nAll I am trying to say is, if you love MJ, you will enjoy the show. \n\nOn the down side, I was only half-impressed by the acrobatics. Some acts hit the plateau rather quickly as the movements become repetitive. Some lack the grace and difficulty. On a few occasions, you could tell the performers were trying too hard to match the beats. Some performances, such as stick fighting, are extraneous, while the over-presence of the popper and guitar player suggests a limited cast. In a nutshell, this is not fully a circus show, a concert, or a dance show. This is MJ. \n\nYou are paying for the beautiful production. The level of details, the authenticity, the nuanced themes, and the empowering message give all the reasons to live through this hour-and-half of immortality with the King."
1,"This would probably be the low-tier of the steakhouses I've been to. Service was great and all but the steaks weren't that great. Even though dry-age steak that was placed in front of the store wasn't that special.\n\nIt's probably a 2.5 in my mind but I guess I would admit this was probably one of my least favorite steak houses i've been to in terms of their steaks. \n\nBread was served cold and you are given sour dough and raisin/nut bread. I prefer the raisin/nut bread. \n\nPrime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so. \n\nFilet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.\n\nDry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.\n\nThe sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette. \n\nMushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...\n \nPotato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must. \n\nCream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?\n\nRegardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party. \n\nI would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me."
3,"Looking for authentic Mexican food? Then this is the place... that you should not order from.  But! I still love Burrito Drive because it is fast and easy.  Usually I just create my own burrito, but if you're feeling sleezy, you can always try the White Trash Burrito, which features American delicacies such as Spam and Velveeta."
4,"Best and Biggest Breakfast I've Ever Had! \n\nThis is definitely THE breakfast place to visit when you are in Vegas...The portions are HUGE so go in with a big appetite ....Everything looked great, but I would recommend the MAN vs. FOOD Favorite = Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs! the best part is...it is all layered on top of eachother...yumm! \n\nGreat Mimosas too!"
3,"There were three of us. Atmosphere was great. Menu was confusing on what to share, what to do. Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing. \n\nThe other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well. \n\nGlass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.\n\nFinal bill was approx $60 each."
0,"I created a Yelp account specifically to warn people of this place - that's how bad it was. Of the thousands of restaurants I've been to I have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first. First of all, the food was terrible. Just on that fact alone I would never go back. In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella. Thank god I had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day. Even though I live right next to it, this will definitely be my one and only experience with Toros Spanish Kitchen and Tapas."
3,"OH! Such a cute place with delicious bagels! The Montreal bagel is quite different from the New York bagel I've known all my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bagel sandwich combos are delicious with a very reasonable price point to match. I wouldn't buy the cream cheese or other items in their fridge -- that is rather overpriced. However, when buying just bagels, it is extremely well priced, particularly when considering the taste!\n\nJust be sure to bring cash -- they don't take credit."
0,"Service was not to par, bordering to poor. Food is just so so, not the best as depicted by some of the reviews. This restaurant is probably set up for banquets and not for dining experience. Skip it and find some place else."
3,"I am always impressed by the food at this restaurant.  This is a step above the typical Mexican place.  Mexicasa also has great drink specials!\n\nMy only complaint is that the food can sometimes take a long time to come out, and on three separate occasions I've ordered carnitas and the tortillas took an additional 10 minutes to come to my table after the food arrived."
2,"For me, the food is just ok.  This place has a beautiful wait staff and is fun to drink at with friends so that is what saves it."
1,"Let me say this. This venue is not a music venue. This is a ballroom. One you would use for wedding. I loved Adele but hated this venue. It was hour, crowded. It took 30 minutes to get in and after going to the other side learned there was only 1 bathroom on the other side. Book and stage and the pool are so much better venues at Cosmo"
4,"I love coming here! My sandwich is always perfect, the soup is flavorful and I love getting free chocolate covered strawberries and bread. The line moves very quick and they are well staffed. Definitely a must try!"
3,"This is a pretty damn cool space! I visited for an Edinburgh Fringe show (Frankenstein: Unbolted - well worth seeing!) and didn't know anything about the venue until we got here. Clue: there's not just one cave - there's many!\n\nWe queued outside and got into the show quickly and the space was super cool. It reminds me a lot of the Arches and similar venues in Glasgow with the stone arched roof, but in a very cool way. For seeing a show it was very comfortable and atmospheric. I didn't get to see much more of the space than the room we were in as we headed back out as soon as the show was done, but now that I know this space is here I'd definitely head back for another show in the future."
3,"They tend to have a great selection of conventionally grown produce (and, no, it's not really a farmer's market.. I wish!).  Their organic produce selection has grown in the past 5 years that I've been shopping here, so I think they'll only grow more with time.  They now at least have a section dedicated to O produce so you don't have to hunt around for it.\n\nOn Wednesdays, they have double-dip days.. meaning that the previous week's ads and the upcoming week's ads are active on the same day - double the deals!\n\nTheir meat section is decent - they always carry Organic beef and Organic chicken, and they have Lamb usually and Bison on occasion.  Of course conventional pork, beef, chicken, etc are always there. \n\nI would have to say the biggest pluses to this place are their bulk items - everything form choc chips to almond flour.. trail mixes... legumes... all kinds of nuts.. baking flours and even alternative snacks (apricots, dried currants, etc).  The other plus is the Vitamin section - TONS and TONS of options for all kinds of supplements, herbs, vitamins, whatever.. it's a great place to get cosmetics, too as they carry all the Alba, Avalon, Burts, Toms, etc.\n\nOccasionally they have the 25% off days for anything in the VItamins/Supplements area or from the Bulk section..  I go crazy up in this place stocking up!\n\nTheir wine selection is actually very nice for a grocery their size.  They tend to carry small batch vineyards at times and that's nice to grab on occasion.\n."
2,"Not bad, but not the best. A lot of selection, bu not as good as some other burger joints.\n\nCan't wait for LV to get a Counter Burger!"
1,"I got the Pad Thai lunch special. It comes with soup, an egg roll, some wonton chips, and a soda. The price was good, but the food was not. The Pad Thai tasted funny. There was some weird after taste; I couldn't figure it out. There were no extra napkins so I had to grab one off the neighboring table. I also ordered the Thai Iced Coffee and it was very sweet. I have this place two stars because of the price. Maybe something else on the menu would taste better, but I'm not willing to try this restaurant again."
0,"I can't stand to be lied straight face from a bunch of grown up men!!! They think we are idiots... They all look so retarded!!! ! We as family used to like them, and one of the guys tried to treat us pretty good, but, now I would not recommend anyone to be taking advantage of like they have been doing to us. We were told that this exactly shop was on the news for a bad reputation and at first I couldn't believe it, but after leaving there today and open my car and see that the floor matt was dirty and all curl up after asking several times to make sure to put a protect paper or plastic so it will not dirt the carpet ... I'm pssssd and I can't stand them anymore.... I guess they don't need business anymore.... The dirty carpet it's not the worse part, the worse part is that they're a bunch of crooks and they look like pot heads and act like them too!!!! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!"
1,"A friend heard this was one of the best buffets in Vegas. Definitely one of the newer ones. I was disappointed from how my friend hyped it up. The venue was nicely decorated and has a lot of options. However, the food wasn't that great.  The hot and sour soup tasted like a bowl of soy sauce. The brisket tasted like charcoal. They didn't have sashimi but did some sushi and rows. The fried chicken batter sucked, and that's supposed to be the best part of fried chicken.  Cevichi wasn't bad. The prime rib blew.  From this, I didn't even bother with the desert. Desert looked pretty so I didn't want to ruin that image with how bad it might taste. Definitely had better and not coming back."
4,"A trendy, upscale\""ish\"" restaurant on the east side? Finally! Loved the food, loved the decor. Now just needs some a clientele under 60 ;')"
0,"The owner runs this joint with an iron fist and if you cross paths with him you'll feel like you in a North Korean labor camp :) It is fun to watch him on small doses\nThe place is nice and clean and above all you feel safe inside ..\nWifi is pretty solid also\n\nupdate, I've been here on few other occasions to wash my bed stuff and homeless are always around some wash in the bathroom and while the owner chases them away its not safe .. i will find a better one for the future"
3,"So I started out this year with a mindset to try out some new ways to stay in shape, and with the help of Yelps Kicks Butt, I tried out the free Crossfit class at Metro Fitness. The gym is gorgeous and the equipment looked clean and well kept. There were plenty of cardio machines as well as an extensive set of weight machines and free weights. It also has a smoothie/protein shake bar for refueling after your workout.\n\nAs to why I was there (the Crossfit class), I really had no idea what to expect. Thought it would be something like a mesh of high school football training and bootcamp. I was half right; it was nothing like bootcamp. The area in which the Crossfit classes takes place is very clean, organized, and easy to navigate. We had two trainers and the owner to help out with the class, and they were very encouraging while also making sure we maintained our form and were working out safely. We did a series of rowing, push presses, box jumps and burpies - as fast as possible within 15 minutes. We then moved from Crossfit to Athletic Conditioning (yay - two workouts in one!), which was also intense but a great workout. Nothing like warming up by pushing a 100 lb sled, right? I'll tell you one thing - I consider myself to be in decent shape - and this workout really kicked my butt (thanks, Yelp!). \n\nAs to the facility as a whole, it's absolutely gorgeous but definitely out of my price range. I would love to be able to join and do Crossfit there more often, but right now I'll just have to hope that they offer more deals in the future so I can once again have a reason to step inside and get my workout on."
3,Steak and eggs!! The homemade green salsa is really good.
3,"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service. Can't really ask for much more. I'll definitely be back."
0,One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Terrible service.  They forgot to bring out silverware after serving our salads.  They brought out our dinner literally 90 seconds after serving us our appetizer.  Then they brought out a meal we did not order.  Now for the food.  The lasagna was swimming in an ocean of sauce that tasted worse than the sauce you get in a supermarket.  My meatball sandwich had a grand total of one and a half meatballs  (three halved meatball slices) on the entire sandwich and my daughter could not eat her chicken fingers because they did not taste right.  How can you mess up chicken fingers?
0,"I had lunch at this restaurant and ordered their specialty duck dish. The price was hefty so I expected to be at least decent. What I got was a piece of duck that was fried to a crisp. The meat tastes like jerky and hard as a rock. When I complained to the staff, the manager said that this is the way the duck is usually cooked at their restaurant and would not even bother to replace it for me. I had only eaten a bite! Even their staff member did not agree with the managers decision to do nothing. For 23.00 dish it was a waste! Don't bother with this establishment. It does not even deserve a 1 star!"
2,"I may be a little unfair about the 3-star but let me explain.  The rooms are gorgeous and big and new.  We were on the 36th floor with a fantastic view.  The lobby is beautiful and there is a shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace every 15 minutes, which is helpful because the hotel itself is tucked away behind Fashion Square Mall.  It was a $15 cab ride to the Bellagio, which was a shame because that's where we spent the majority of our time.  Another negative is that there is a train thing that goes through the hotel somewhere .... not very descriptive but I could hear a train whistle all night - LOUDLY.  If you're going with kids, this is a good option because there is no casino at the hotel ..... good in some ways, bad in the other.  It would be great if we had closer options to a casino but if you're with a group and some want to go home and some want to continue gambling, you're out alone or you're stuck going back with your group.  There is also a $20/day resort fee, which is extremely unncessary considering there is no casino and, except for the pool, nothing free that would warrant that required fee.  The 3-star from me comes from being far from the good parts of the strip, no casino, the loud train whistle and the required resort fee.  If you're not looking to be within walking distance to the busy parts of the Strip or you're not looking to gamble, you may feel this is the place for you."
2,"Went here for brunch because we had a voucher. Overall I was impressed by our meal. My husband and I ate outside on the patio which was very pleasant.  We ordered coffee (3.5) and I ordered a Bloody Mary  which was a little on the spicy side but tasted fresh and my husband ordered a mimosa ($6 each). We shared the seasonal fruit plate which has a nice variety of fruit  including strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, blueberries, blackberries, and pineapples, but the melon was not ripe and some strawberries were over ripe ($8). I ordered the corned beef benedict ($11) and my husband ordered the classic benedict ($12). The corned beef was a little dry, but I should have expected that! The hollandaise was tart. Best breakfast potatoes I have ever had! We made a reservation per our voucher request but the place was almost empty. I was disappointed that the Westin does not have complementary parking for its guests."
1,"The highlight of my meal was the lemongrass iced tea... which wasn't even that superb to being with. I understand what Tottie is trying to do here, but the execution is just blah. My steamed pork egg roll was dry and more stuffed with lettuce than anything, the peanut sauce didn't even soften it up. The sushi was mediocre and honestly forgettable. The 2nd star is for ambience, since it was pretty strategically lit and set up. I dunno, I wasn't really impressed and probably won't return again, but then again maybe Tottie's isn't my cup of tea."
2,This place was nice.   It's small and intimate.  The tickets were cheap but my friend couldn't help but complain about the price of the tiny bag of popcorn he got.  As I said it was nice but some things were hit or miss.  If this place was closer to Glendale I would most likely return.
2,"Great beers on tap, fun snack food and a quick stumble to the orange line...we all know how important that is to me. There was a jazz band playing and because I am getting old, I found that it was a bit too loud and I could only hear the person sitting right beside me, but still, for a Tuesday night, it made for a cool atmosphere. The beer was a tad on the pricey side especially given that it's north of the tracks and the room was nothing special, so that's why they only get 3 stars instead of 4."
0,"Our friend convinced us to check out Cravings buffet before the Love show and boy were we sorely wrong about this place. We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.\n\nThe prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away. \n\nThe Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.\n\nthe italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold. \n\nTIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold. \n\nthe only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....\n\nthe food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn."
4,"I went on this with my mother and we absolutely loved the Graveyard tour. I can't remember out tour guide's name, but he was fabulous. I was enthralled and couldn't stop listening! He was very informative about what we were seeing as we walked around town and shared info about the history- both accurate and kind of disturbing... This town has some haunted history. \n\nTour guide even showed us some extra fun stuff after the tour was over- their school that inspired JK Rowling for her vision of Hogwarts and the grave of Thomas Riddle in Greyfriars. \n\nI'd absolutely recommend this tour to anyone wanting to learn some history and like the darker side of it. Much better than the Real Mary King's Close tour... After this tour, the close just seemed awful and hokey."
2,"Stopped by tonight for dinner. On Tuesday's they have 3 dollar tacos. My wife had the tacos and dug 'em. That's a lot to say as we are pretty critical of our tacos. \n\nI took advantage of the $30 anniversary deal: ceprese salad, filet, chocolate  souffle. The steak was good, came on some potatoes and vegetable and topped with a bearnaise sauce. \n\nOverall, not too bad. We may eat there again, but it's kind of a drive and probably not good enough to pull us across town again."
2,"It's a good place,  You certainly can't complain about their salad bar. It's fresh and a great selection.\n\nTheir soups are ok. I typically only find 1 maybe 2 that I think is really good.  I love their muffins and their pizza slices.\n\nService is good too. \n\nI just wish they would change up things on their hot bar more often."
1,"Ok why does the gate have to be like a million miles away?  I swear that tram ride gets longer every time I go.  When you get there, it seems ok.  I guess the anticipating of getting to the strip has you distracted from the fact that it is a long way to get out of the airport.\n\nOn the way home, everything is miserable.  The long walk to security.  The horrible long lines, even when I flash my badge to go through the express lane.  The ride on the tram seems like you gone a mile to get to this 3-story escalator.  When you get to the top you are greeted by restaurants that makes your hangover worse from all the greasy smell in the air.  The only good experience I had was getting bored from a delayed flight and slipping a $5 bill into the slot machine and winning $87.00, 10-minutes later."
2,"busy, busy, busy.. \nthey have a convenience store, car wash, smog check station,auto shop, plus gas all in one corner location. I went for the smog check. Reasonably priced, quick and friendly service. I paid for the smog inside the convenience store which was stocked with plenty of food and snacks to put a smile on your face."
2,"Usually I really don't like chain stores, chain cafes, well anything too branded really. \n\nHowever ... this place is not half bad. The fact that it's right outside my apartment helps of course. Because it is situated inside Blackwell's it's really rather nice to just spend a little bit of time reading and studying in here. It's difficult to put my finger on the sore spot with this one. The drinks are surprisingly good, the staff is friendly yet ...something's a little off.\n\nI came here a lot especially when I first moved here, been away for a while but am slowly coming back to it. The coffee is sometimes burned but mostly surprisingly good, and the staff is friendly and has good banter.\n\nIf you sit here for long enough though, it does get clear that this place exists to make money. It's the difference in feel that you have between a chain store and an individually owned cafe. It's not bad, it just hasn't got much heart. Sometimes you can tell that the staff really doesn't want to be there. Well, not much heart, but good coffee. I guess that just about sums it up!"
1,Horrible happy hour martinis - unless you like pure sugar syrup. Food is not much better. Would not recommend it.
2,"Decided to make another review about this place. My fiance kept telling me that he wants to go here so I decided to give it another shot since the last time I went here it was on those busy weekends. Went here around 10pm on a wednesday. Finally got seated right when we got there. The waitress was nice, but it looked like she hated working there and she only stopped by our table 4 times. First time was to get us drinks, second time to deliver our food, third time because my chicken ceasar wrap was sooo dry and I had that before so it didn't taste like that the first time I tried it, the fourth time was just to deliver the check. Haha some service. Food was cheap though, and finally got it faster then usual. I recommend coming here late at night on a weekday because this place can be hell fridays - sundays. Unless you have the patience of a saint."
0,"Let me say the service here is unparalleled.  We had a main server and an assistant.  There were also other people that would come to our table to check on us and offer assistance all throughout the meal.  When my sister asked where the restroom was, a gentleman actually escorted she and my mom to the ladies room.  Nice touch.\n\nMy negative review is for the steak/kitchen.  We ordered our steaks medium well.  We received them medium rare.  No big deal.  We sent them back to be cooked a little longer but what we then received was a charred MESS!!  I mean my steak was completely black!!  You could not cut the top of the steak with the knives they provided!!  CRAZINESS!!   And to top it all the inside was STILL red!  I have never had a steak come out to me looking like that.  There was no excuse.  \n\nMy family and I were there to celebrate my sisters birthday.  We previously had an awesome experience there so we wanted to re-create that wonderful night.  Well it's true, you can't go home again because this time the kitchen truly screwed up.  The flavor of the meat was fine but trying to eat that bitter char on top was not working for me.  Truly ridiculous.  2 of the steaks we just sent back and did not get a replacement because of time, we had already sent the steak back once.  So a couple of us just ate sides for my sisters birthday dinner.  \n\nThe management did provide desserts on the house.  That was nice of them but really we just wanted to get out of there before the deli closed :-/  We were hungry!!!\n\nI loved CUT so much the first visit that I would have loved to give it more than 1 star this time.   Again the service was impeccable.  The atmosphere is chic and welcoming.  But seriously, the person that burnt those steaks up is ridiculous and should not be in a kitchen.  Even on my stove at home I wouldn't have demolished a steak that way.  I understand that everyone makes mistakes but that was terrible.    Only thing redeeming about the visit was the excellent service and the way it was handled.  But you make reservations for a special occasion simply for the atmosphere.  I wanted good food."
3,"Another gem off the beaten path. It's in the Wal - Mart plaza. \n\nThe BBQ is actually a fusion of Hawaiian, Korean and Japanese.\n\nEverything I tried so far is pretty good and believe me I tried alot last time. Next time I think I'm just gonna go with the AYCE for 13 bucks. \n\nThis is mom and pop shop, never really seen it busy but thats probably because not many people know about it. \n\nThe Chicken Katsu was pretty good and the Bul-go-gi kinda tatse like the fake beef from yoshinoya in a GOOD way. You know you love the meat from there even if you are unsure if it's real meat sometimes. \n\nWorth checking it out."
1,"Very expensive I came here for a car was with a $10 coupon and they wanted $11 more for interior clean. So I got exterior only. Didn't fininsh the drying, had to drive my own car through the wash. Don't think I would go there again."
1,"No complaints about the burrito I just ate, it was pretty good! But, one thing I noticed on my way out that bothered me is that the cook didn't wear gloves, that's so so so unsanitary and it made my stomach turn :("
2,"The decor makes it obvious this place has been open since the early '70's but the nice thing about it is they aren't pretentious enough to change anything.  \n\nService is steady and friendly.  It's pretty quiet in the evenings because their main rushes are breakfast and lunch.  But they're open late compared to the higher end (and snobbier) restaurants nearby that close mid-afternoon.  The BLT Club is good, the french fries are always hot and soda refills are free.  They also have a standard selection of bottled brews."
3,Sushi is fresh and service is great.  I just wish the place could accommodate more people.  Sometimes the wait isn't worth the time.
3,"I love Constellation Coffee for the following reasons:\n\n1. Atmosphere is delightful. Its a really bright & sunny room with hardwood floors. Very minimal & clean. There is also a bar where you can sit & have coffee. There are about 6 tables, and a back room for more quieter meetings or discussions. Also the music Amy choses to play is great! I almost never put headphones in which is nice. A lot of oldies, hip-hop, and other upbeat tunes. \n\n2. Menu - great selection of coffee & tea very reasonable priced! She often has treats from Pittsburgh Pie guys in shop. Coffee beans are from a place in Maryland called Ceremony. Good stuff!\n\n3. The owner Amy is very pleasant. She is super friendly. It's also inspiring to see someone so young run a wonderful little shop."
1,Woo whee this place is expensive. For pre-made cheap Chinese food under a hot lamp my wife and I spent nearly $25! The food is ok but the prices are outrageous.
1,"This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.  The food was okay, but the service was TERRIBLE!  It took 35 minutes to have our order taken.  We sat virtually ignored except our glasses of water until the waitress finally came over to see if we wanted to order.  Once the order was put in, we waited an hour for food to show up.  We asked after we'd been sitting for over an hour and the waitress said she would find out. When she came back she said it would be soon.  We asked why it had taken so long, and she said, \""It's only been 45 minutes since I put it in.\"" We replied, \""But we've been waiting for almost 1.5 hours.\"" She repeated that the order hadn't been in that long instead of apologizing and explaining the hold up.  The table next to us was then served (after waiting for ages) and she said, \""They were here first...obviously.\"" and then walked off.  We hadn't even said a word about the other table when she made that rude comment.\n\nAt that point we went to the manager to complain.  He apologized and about 15 minutes later it was obvious our waitress had been spoken to. She said, \""I'm sorry for the wait and we'd like to offer free dessert. should I bring you a chocolate fondue?\""  We said no and we would like to figure out our own dessert. She made another rude comment at that point. Something like, \""you *don't* want the fondue.  Fine.\"" One person in our party couldn't partake because it had taken so long to get her one side order that she then had to leave to make another engagement.  \n\nIt also took another 15 minutes to get our check and we tried flagging down anyone.  They avoided making eye contact so they did not have to come over.  \n\nLike i said in the beginning, the food was pretty good but I've had lots of pretty good food without the 1) super long wait and 2) crazy rude waitress.  I have to imagine that working at the Sugar Factory on the Strip in Las Vegas is a pretty lucrative gig for a waiter.  If they treat other customers this way they won't make any money in tips and the restaurant will suffer.\n\nI would suggest going anywhere else but this place.  Serendipity gets great reviews and it is right across the street. Go there (or anywhere else) instead.  Save yourself the trip."
2,"Had their \""signature\"" dry aged NY strip. Not very special. Go for the rib eye or Prime rib. Service was great, but for the price the food could be much better."
4,"While I've been all over the country, and every House of Blues is pretty much the same, at least they're the same in that they're a great place to see a concert.  Good view of the stage from the entire venue and small enough to make it feel intimate (The Joint or The Pearl).  I especially like the great camera crew that shows the band on closed circuit TV's all over the club.  Three bars ensure you can always get a drink pretty quick, though at a major dent to your wallet.  It's a long walk from the parking garage, too, so be prepared for that!"
3,"I joined Capital Fitness for two reasons: \n1. it is right downtown and easy to walk to, \n2. They have personal TVs attached to many of the cardio machines, making working out fly by. \n\nOther than that, the locker rooms are always clean and empty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, there is free parking underneath the building, and it never seems packed or empty. \n\nAdditionally, you can pay month-to-month, which was unique to Cap Fitness when I researched a few places in January 2009."
3,"Movidos por un cierto contentismo provocado por unas cuantas copas de vino y un delicios\u00edsimo whisky, terminamos una de nuestras m\u00faltiples cenas en este pub de Edimburgo. Un sitio bastante chulo, y donde los booths (los sillones con mesa en medio) son tan privados como que tienen una puerta.\n\nEs pay as you go (es decir, hay que levantarse, pedir en la barra y pagar) pero est\u00e1n especializados en whisky y merece la pena pasarse a catar un poquillo. Yo ya no pod\u00eda m\u00e1s con el whisky, as\u00ed que ped\u00ed un c\u00f3ctel, que obviamente no es su especialidad, aunque tampoco estaba malo del todo.\n\nEn serio: c\u00e9ntrate en el whisky, te ir\u00e1s a casa m\u00e1s contento."
4,LOVE their nachos and chicken rolled tacos! Awesome place!
3,"This is a nice, clean gym with a pool and brand new treadmills as of 8/2014. I left You Fit due to the lack of child care. My kids love the Kids Care here, they play a movie, Wii and seem to have a good time playing with the other kids. There was a mixup on the enrollment fee as my kids seemed to pay one too since they are enrolled in the kids care but apart from that I do like the gym. $30/mo and that includes the Kids Care."
3,"This place isn't the nicest. The staff here aren't the friendliest. Actually, it honestly feels like they're not even trying. However, for $1.99 for a piece of clothing (used to be $1.25 or $1.75, still not bad), I'm not complaining.\n\nEverything I've brought in here were nicely cleaned and pressed/steamed by the time I got it back. Nothing got lost, a button didn't magically disappear, etc. Honestly, every time I visit Vegas, I pack as much clothing that needs to be dry cleaned so I can have it cleaned here. Why bother having it cleaned somewhere else here when it's going to cost more, right?"
4,"After a week of no air conditioning and finally concluding that the cause was electrical in nature, I gave Good Guys a call. Mike answered right away and was able to come out to Gilbert that same afternoon! He was patient with my lack of electrical/AC maintenance knowledge and figured out the problem soon after arriving. Not only did he save me from the hell that was having no A/C, but also did so very quickly and at an awesome price. I would HIGHLY recommend Mike for any and all of your electrical needs!"
4,"Started with oysters and Chardonnay - then grilled Tilapia, rice, and zucchini - a perfect meal!    All recommended by our beautiful bartender who looked exactly like Thandie Newton!  Then - walk the mall at tempe mkt place. Very nice!!!!"
4,"This place is amazing. \nI am by no means a German Food critic - nor do I know what German food is \""supposed\"" to taste like, but hopefully this is it, because it's amazing.  My husband was stationed in Germany for 6 Years, and he loves it... so I trust his opinion. \n\nI love the beer, I love the spatzel, I LOVE the snitzel. \n\nI bring everyone to Haus Murphy I can, because everything is amazing. \nA few times, I brought my parents and there was a polka bang being amazing in the bar area. \n\nI love this resturant."
3,This is my FAVORITE BBQ place in Las Vegas. The meat is juicy and the flavors are great!
2,"Even with a coupon, the drinks are overpriced ($13 girly drinks, $10 for Jack & Coke)...however, there's something to be said about killing an hour or two on a patio, drinking Jack & Cokes, watching the freaks parade down the strip."
1,Server was polite. Food was marginal and took waaay too long to come out. Beer selection very limited. The only thing that kept a smile on my face was watching ppl fall off of the mechanical bull.
0,TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We will never go back. They couldn't get our order right again. When I told them about it they wouldn't do anything about. We are done. Been there 3 times now and all 3 times has been bad. To have a good successful business you MUST have good customer service with smiling faces. You sure don't see that there.
4,"Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!\n\nThe Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.\n\nOur server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
0,"We were there before they changed their menu and were a tapas restaurant. Before, the food was delicious and since they've changed it, it's horrendous.  My bf got the chimichunga and he said it was just a bunch of meat and cheese that they rolled up to make it a big burrito. He said it tasted like nothing, no flavor.  I got the shrimp taco which also tasted like nothing but I can taste the chared shrimp. I also got the fish taco and del taco's fish taco is  actually better than theirs and finally got their veggie taco. Our waitress said the veggie taco was her favorite...it had no taste whatsoever. It was basically a bunch of meat and cheese and veggies made to fit in a taco. \n\nOh, our appetizers was plain nachos and it taste like pepperoni pizza rolls with guacamole and sour cream on top.  The pizza rolls itself taste better than their nachos. It seems like they fried their chips and then added cheese and baked it and then added the pico, guacamole, and sour cream.\n\nOverall, the place was better as a tapas Spanish restaurant and before they changed their menu. We will not be going back to toros."
2,"Nice selection of beer, but I've found the food to be hit or miss. I've had some good sandwiches here in the past, but the grilled chicken wrap I had a few days ago was subpar. Also not a fan of the way all the food seems to come with potato chips. Still, this is a decent place and worth checking out if you're in the mood for a sandwich."
4,I have had several meals there and was very pleased with their comfort foods  .  Deserts are huge portions and very good.  I have also used their catering service. No complaints
1,"As with any buffet, you get what you pay for.  This place is about $14 for dinner if I recall correctly.\n\nThe Mongolian grill section doesn't have much selection to choose from, but it's pretty yummy regardless.  The sushi is surprisingly good for buffet sushi.  Pot stickers are really good.  Pepper steak is excellent.  Orange chicken is decent.\n\nSo why only 2 stars?  Well, it's the tour groups.  The place is a madhouse when the tour groups come in.  It's just too crowded to find any sort of comfort.  Not to mention the people on the tour group are frequently rude and shove you and cut in line.  They used to only have tour groups on weekend nights.  They are there all the time now, even weekday lunches.  Not to be racist, but there is a cultural difference that I just can't wrap my head around.  I don't understand visiting a foreign country and eating a bastardized version of food from your homeland."
2,"My visit took place on Jan 01, 2015. I ate at the bar and watched the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut also know that I actually sought out this restaurant because more than one professional restaurant reviewer listed Pizza Rock as amongst the \""Top 10 Pizzas - 2014\"" in Las Vegas. In addition, these writers noted that the restaurant has multiple pizza ovens - different ovens to facilitate the production of different styles (Neapolitan, Roma, New York, Chicago...) of pizza, and this caught my interest.\n\nSo let's start with the positives:\n\nIt has a great location. It is across the street from the Downtown Grand, or one block off of Fremont Street. So if you want to get away from the noise, and casino and chain eateries on Fremont Street without having to drive, it a good option.\n\nThe interior is well decorated. If you want to have a nice meal without distractions, you can.  And if you want to sit in an area with views of TV screens to monitor your sports team, you can.\n\nThe pricing is very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber, and the service was also very good.\n\nBut with regards to the food.... I can only give \""an average\"" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the Traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was doughy and more like fresh bread. The bottom (flat area) of the crust was \""wetter\"" than I prefer. Maybe this is the new trend. (I also visited \""800 Degrees\"" on the Las Vegas Strip, and experienced the same issue of wet crust.) Perhaps I need to try a different \""style\"" of pizza next time?\n\nHere's the bottom line: the place is nice enough that I am willing to go back and try another meal. And having read my review, the staff is friendly enough: you or I can describe the textures we want from our pizza to the server. They can suggest a style of pizza that is to your liking, or they can ask the kitchen to accommodate. And they do have other entrees besides pizza.\n\nIt has a full bar, and a good selection of standard and craft beers."
1,I wanted to do some price comparison to see if this place could be a savings over my vision insurance options. I have several pairs of glasses that based on my previous insurance are loaded up with all the niceties that Pearl Vision has to offer. I no longer work for the company that gave that type of vision coverage.  I have visited this location twice in the last six months and the experience both times has been poor. The first time there were already customers looking at glasses when I walked in so no one greeted me. I looked around and left and don't think anyone noticed. \nThat can be great if you don't want to be bothered however if you have questions or are a social person that type of treatment can be offsetting. \n\nThis next time I was greeting right when I walked in and told if I had questions to ask. Nice. I looked around and when I found my frames went to the counter. The sales woman was snarky and I don't even think that she was aware of it. She could not answer my questions without basing them on the current type of glasses I was wearing. I have several pairs of glasses that based on my previous insurance are loaded up with all the niceties that Pearl Vision has to offer Helpful in overwhelming me but not so much in just answering my basic question; being with the promo offered what do you really get..
4,"The BEST croissants in town- for sure, bar none. I have been in love with this little gem since I first walked into the tiny charming shop decades ago- the quality, the butter, the flakiness, the smells!! Such a treat, each and every time!"
3,"The food at Sensi was all around delicious. The bread they put out for the table is a combination of naan, a crispy Indian flat bread and a few others - really good. Of note, the salmon and the scallops were the best I have had in a while. \n\nWith 5 of us, we had a huge private booth and plenty of space. Service was attentive and a little awkward at times... not really too much of a sense of humor but with this being more of an \""upscale\"" place I suppose that is just what you get! That... and maybe a few of the inappropriate jokes/conversations we were having could have been what they were frowning about... but come on it's Vegas. What do you expect?"
0,"This place is horrible! Let me first say that I have gone to the babystacks on buffalo too many times to count and I love it. The food was always exceptional, as was the staff. I didn't like how cramped it was, however, so I was happy when they built this one. So let me tell you why I despise this location. The first time my fianc\u00e9 and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes, which I've had many times, without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fianc\u00e9 was done with his meal. I start eating them, and they are pretty darn good, then I just decide to flip my pancake over and what do I see?!?! Another freaking nut on the bottom of the freaking pancake!!! Are you kidding me?! At this point I'm almost in tears. This is my life, like it's kind of serious. The waiter kind of laughed and took them away again. I'm sorry, is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah. I wasn't just some disgruntled customer who didn't like something. This should have been taken a lot more serious than it was. Needless to say I will never set foot In this building again. Their pancakes are pretty freaking good, but not good enough to be my last meal!!"
0,"I used to come here literally once a week. My staples were the cheese crisp, chips and salsa, Red Corn Chicken Taquitos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chicken Maxamillian and I have tried just about everything on their menu. \n\nI was here opening day at this location. I used to LOVE and adore Macayos. Until about one year ago. They hired a new manager. It started with a lot of great waiters who knew me by name dropping off like flies. Still, there were a few left and I perservered through crappy service to get the food. NOW every SINGLE time I go the soda is flat, the cheese crisp is not cooked correctly, and the service is aweful.\n\n It has steadily been becoming worse and worse since Anne, the manager started. I'm not trying to attack her personally but clearly she is not doing it right. My chips are always cold and I have even walked out because it was so crappy. This is coming from someone who has gone to Macayos since BIRTH. For 23 years I have been 'frequent' and since age 18 I went literally every or every other week. \n\nI LOVED Macayos, it was my FAVOURITE in the world, and now I cant stand to go.  It used to be a friendly, happy family atmosphere, with good food, awesome service and bubbly fizzy soda. No longer. Not since. I have tried and tried again to relive the glory days, but I think it has seen and passed them. I went to Macayos in Tucson and it reminded me of when this location was great. Sad times.\n\nI have literally spent THOUSANDS here. But now I wont spend a penny, unless I hear management has changed."
2,"I gave this an A-OK rating because i'm not an expert of PHO. I like the food, but just haven't been to plenty of vietnamese places.\n\nI ordered the spicy beef pho. It was good, very large bowl and the price was great ! This place was recommended to me by my asian friends. And i saw lots of asain peeps eating there as well, so it's probably a good place. Service was good, even though they were really busy.  I would go again, the menu has plenty of selections."
0,"Bank of America  ah yes the power of Ken Lewis squirming his way out of insider trading while he buys $100++ trash cans for his office and lays people off . Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10,000 another for about $12,000 then another for about $25,000 not only that everything that I charged bounced and there where about I guess $400 more dollars . \n       I called the bank two where used for cars and one for someones cruise  vacation I said wait a minute did it not raise a flag when a $25,000 purchase came threw  when I mostly just use it max of $1000. Well there must have been a \""bank error \"" they said. You damm right there was !!\n       Anyway the bank did put, the money back except and this is the shi..ty part they said I would have to pay the returned fees from the charges that I made and there was no money ? I said if you had caught those huge transactions it would have not been a problem. Any way we went round and round finally about 2 months later they fixed it then I closed my account I did not want to until this was settled .. Another Bank now \nScrew you Ken Lewis ...hope you go to jail for shi..ting on little people!!!"
0,"KOA should not sponsor this RV park, it is horrible. I can't believe it is a KOA! It is a PARKING LOT! sure its on the strip, but wow, when its 114 in the shade this is not where you want to be in your trailer. sizzle sizzle sizzle .....pass out."
2,"When I buy from a truck I assume it should be a good value as their overhead is low with out a building etc. However I think I am paying more because the are only open a few hours a day and need to be sustained on those limited hours. \n\nThis hold true with uprooted, I paid $8 for a spinach, and tempeh bowl, it had some walnuts and blue cheese. At a normal casual counter style place for this size it would be $4.50 for this salad. \n\nValue aside the food was good, and healthy as I was hungry about 12 minutes later.\n\nMy cynicism is really directed at the food truck craze and not this trailer as they are on part with the lack of value"
4,"Visiting from LA, looked for a place to eat late at night and found this place. Would recommend the Champion burger, pulled pork fries, sunrise biscuit, and beignets"
3,"Topless vampire lesbians. Cloth dancers hanging from ceiling. Nunchuck/katana fights. Styx. Drunk dudes yelling obscenities at all the above.  Great performance by all. That being said, two of the erotic rock angels had the WORST boob jobs ever! NASA would have to invest decades in a bra to get those suckers back together again! Other girls were all gorgeous. Come sail away with this show. Worth the money if you're into topless vampires and 80's metal!"
1,"After reading raving reviews of Glass Nickel Pizza, I have to say it was underwhelming.  I have honestly come to prefer Papa John's.  But then again, I don't eat meat so I wouldn't take this review TOO seriously.  I'm sure their other pizzas are good."
4,"Beautiful poker room with plenty of money and action. It's got an open airy feel to it, very comfortable place to play. One of the top 3 places I go to play poker when I'm in town."
0,"Just terrible, even for a 24 hour cafe.  \n\nI came here because, well, just LOOK at these other reviews.  This place looks great, right?  Fellow yelpers, how could you fail me so miserably?!\n\nI made a special trip.  Not there to gamble, just to have breakfast.  I've had better food at nursing homes.\n\nThe eggs Benedict was unrecognizable as such.  Is that megaplex nacho cheese?   I didn't even want to try it because it looked so hideous.  Like congealed latex.\n\nAnd the eggs were not even remotely poached.  More like hard boiled into some thing beyond a solid.  As in, like maybe something one would find on the surface Jupiter.  \n\nAnd the grits?  Well, I guess I should know better than to order grits in Las Vegas, but   these were somehow both watery and grainy at the same time.  \n\nI kept looking for the hidden camera, because surely I was being punked.\n\nTop it off with a bloody mary that was basically clamato juice and (a half shot?) vodka with a touch of tabasco.  ie. about the most uninspired version of a bloody mary I've ever had the displeasure of drinking.  \n\nI rarely send back food and then not give them the opportunity to try again.  But this place was clearly beyond all redemption."
3,"I literally live across the street and come in all the time. Today wasn't a pleasant visit, my waitress was so unfriendly never came by to ask if we were ok. The hostess had to ask if we've been helped yet and got us our drink order. She also has to get us our refills and our check. When the waitress braught us our check she put it on the table and walked away without saying a word or looking at us, So I gave the hostess the tip and said thank you. I give it 4 stars because the food is amazing and so was the hostess at the door. The waitress I'll never sit in her section if she is ever there."
4,"What makes The Birthday Suit unique is that THEY CARE. I have been to countless salons where you are just a number or they look at your ticket see your name and pretend they remember you. Stacy will always remember you and it makes going to your next visit like visiting a friend not just going to another appointment. \n\nWhere do I start, have to say the customer service. I have seen Stacy every time and she is simply amazing. She is so friendly and makes you feel so comfortable (when you would think being  1/2 naked on a table baring all you wouldn't be). I have been waxing for years back in my home town but the wax that is use here much better and less painful. Stacy takes pride in her work and does such a great job even with my stubborn leg hairs, I am a challenge and she wins every time! Knowing you can go back if you ever need a touch up is great, but I have yet needed to go back. \n\nThe children's room is such a great idea for those moms just wanting to keep up with waxing without the expense of a sitter, A+ for that idea. They have great products from the body scrub (that I use daily) to the lotion that actually moisturizes and all great prices and there is always a deal going on you can catch for a discount. \n\nPrices are very reasonable and no excuse to not afford it because they have countless deals and promotions, check them out on FaceBook or just call for deals. \n\nThis Yelper Highly Recommends The Birthday Suit"
2,Corporate burgers has options.
0,"The owner is a rude jerk that takes advantage of people. The stuff is WAY over priced. It's a thrift store, not antique shop. They are ridiculous. Stuff is thrown everywhere. There's no organization at all. \n\nThe two \""good\"" reviews\"" are from known employees and should be removed. They are liars. You'd get better stuff at Goodwill and they charge too much as well"
2,Basic and decent gym with good low price memberships. At night are the busier hours and harder time to get to weights. My only complaints are the hours of service and no wifi to play music! My phone service sucks by the treadmills and back of the building.
1,"I wanted to love this place with it's cute decor and giant coffee mugs. We went in on a weekday morning where there was enough staff on for every table to have their own server. After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well."
2,Wandered in here on Saturday past about 4pm hoping to get a bit of late breakfast or early dinner but things were clearly winding to a close despite the sandwich board outside proclaiming proper food being available till 17:30. Scones & cake weren't what we were after so just stayed for a pleasant cuppa instead. Can't fault the service or prices but they maybe want to be clearer about when they are or aren't serving full meals.
0,Totally avoid this place. Spend a few more $$s and go to the one at Bellagio but do so after 12noon as the Japenese and Italian stations do not open until then. The food at Flavor lacked flavor completely. It must take some effort to make simple dishes taste so bad!
4,"I love this place! Everyone here is great, personally I see Keri and she always does such a fantastic job. She's very thorough and professional.  Definitely nicest place with always the best results and everyone is so friendly!"
4,"Best dentist ever! I went to him yrs. ago ('98) after I had been on chemotherapy. I found out that I had 16 cavities and a few root canals and it was going to cost me thousands of dollars. After sitting in that chair for thousands of hours and after $16,000 my teeth were redone. Ever since then when I go and have my teeth whitened or when I've been to another dentist (even though he is my dentist now!) everybody compliments me on his work.  He did a lot of detailed work like root canals and bridges but he saved my teeth. I am grateful for that.  Most dentists would have just ripped out all my teeth and put in fake ones. He's an honest doctor and I am lucky to have been referred to him so long ago."
1,"If you enjoy sneezing for an hour after you wake up, this is the place for you.  The air in the apartments during the winter is so dry that you need to put pots of water on the heater to make it bearable.  While they have recently redone the lobby area, the rooms are still very much lacking.  I would not recommend these apartments to anyone other than hockey fans, as it was nice to be able to walk over and catch a hockey game anytime you like."
0,"This hospital was appalling. My visit started with admitting, where they misplaced my paperwork and I had to call my doctor to tell them the problem, who in turn, got the supervisor in admitting to all of a sudden locate the orders that had been faxed to them twice.  Really??  Upon arrival for the surgery, my admission was slowed down by lack of information because for some reason, two days later, my per-op information was not completely entered into the system. Entering the prep room, the nurse inserting the IV poked and missed so many times my vein collapsed and my hand swelled up like a football and they had to move to the other hand, all the while, all she could talk about was the tatto on my wrist, which is a memorial to my son who had recently passed. This, of course, upsetting, depressing, and irritating me right before surgery. Again, really??  Upon waking in recovery, I had major spinal surgery. My entire lower lumbars were fused with an unbelievable amount of hardware. My surgeon, who is not a resident doctor there, was wonderful. Sorry to say, this hospital was too far under his league of expertise. I woke from surgery to an 10 inch incision in my abdominal area and an 8 inch incision in my back, 42 staples, and an indescribable level of pain. I was given no pain control whatsoever. I laid in recovery like this for 9 hours before I was given a room. In the meantime, my husband and other son were waiting in the waiting room for 15 hours at this point, not being told anything about my condition, and when asked, they were told I just went home by a nurse who was impatient and uncaring and didn't bother to check for them. They had to ask another nurse, who finally found out that I finally got into a room, and was told a room number and I was there. They got to the room to find I was not only not there, but it wasn't even my room. When they finally got the right room, they sat and waited there because I wasn't even out of recovery yet. Incompetent.  Once in my room, the nurses were huffy, uncaring, impatient and rude. I was left with no pain control for 24 hours before my surgeons assistant came and took care of it herself. Every time I needed assistance, I had to call for a nurse repeatedly, only to get results when I became loud out of pain and frustration. Every person there during my visit was incompetent, rude, obviously hated their jobs, uncaring, in compassionate, and god forbid if it was time for a shift change. Never, in my life, will I ever, ever, EVER recommend this cold, heartless, thoughtless, rude, uncaring, in compassionate so called hospital/staff.  They should all be put in front of the board and the building should be shut down. I will refuse to even die there. I'd chose the gutter first, the rats would be of more assistance and compassion than Valley Hospital in Las Vegas."
1,Marginal at best for the money. The whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other Westin properties I have stayed at.
0,"Place is so grossss total dump, I recently went to tempe for spring training and this place was right next door to our hotel \""comfort inn\""  this place is a dump big mistake food is like rubber and greasy not to mention you have to pay sauce??? that is just stupid  not to mention it's cash out, that should of been a red flag for dump.  Gave me an upset stomach"
2,"A group of us stayed at the Palazzo for a trade show and saw these awesome pictures of burgers from this place.  After being at a trade show for 3 days, I was hankering for some white rice.  They have Loco Moco!! YAY!  The Poutine fries, Garbage fries, and fried Mac and Cheese were gooood.  The fried mac and cheese are these bits of fried squares of creamy goodness.  Also had the fried pickles.  Wasn't to excited about these.  They sliced the pickles lengthwise and the batter was greasy and not much flavor.  My co-workers like their burgers.  There were 6 of us so I don't remember what they ordered.  I got the Loco Moco and was disappointed.  I ordered it medium rare.  The burger was cooked on too high of heat too fast cause the edges were hard and dry and only a tiny piece was medium rare.  The rice... there bunch of crunchy pieces... yah.... hard rice... not good....  My coworker had the red velvet cheese cake.  There was the crust,  then there is a layer of red velvet cake and then cheese cake on top.  He really liked it.  I got the banana fosters cheese cake.  Is it worth the calories?  Only if there wasn't an ice cream place around. \n\n1 star for the fried mac and cheese\n1 star for the server who was quick and efficient (he knew we had to catch a flight)\n1 star for the Poutine and Garbage fries"
1,Ordered during my lunch today with just 3 or 4 others in the entire restaurant. I waited close to a half hour for my food (which was just an appetizer by the way). Ended up having to get my food to go so I could get back to lunch. Also sat at the bar and waited to be checked in with. Never happened. This was the first unsatisfactory experience I've had at Red Lobster. I'll stick to my usual location for future reference.
2,"It was just ok. For 10 bucks for lunch with a drink I had hoped it would be a little better. I had hibachi beef, which seemed like some low grade cut, no sirloin here. Shrimp sauce and rice was good. Carrot slices and broccoli were both very tiny. Not horrible, but for the money there are much better work lunch options around here."
0,"Discovered this place about a month ago and tonight was my 5th and LAST time ever going. Ordered pizza and wings. Out of an order of wings 4 of them were so small that they should have been thrown away instead of served to customers. I uploaded a picture for you to see for yourself. Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!\nNever have I been victim to such awful customer service in my entire life. This place could have had a customer for life with my wife and I, now I can guarantee I will never step foot in the House of Pizza ever again."
1,"Two of us came here for New Year Eve dinner.  We were sat in the lounge area for dinner.  Granted we were walk-in and the main dining area was full.  The food was good, but nothing too special.  It was expensive for what it was.  Given so many options in Vegas, I probably will not go back."
2,"First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service."
0,"This is THE WORST strip club I have ever been to. I have been to a lot of seedy clubs as well. I've been to clubs where every chick is coked out of her mind to the point where she can't even dance, clubs where chicks are dancing around while the other strippers are watching their babies, even places where girls say they have been raped by club owners. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. \n\nThe New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.\n\nThe dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places. Even the overpriced Bourbon Street would be a better bet than this."
3,"This place has more \""cool\"" atmosphere than anywhere else downtown and you have to be ready for that.  The hipsters will be everywhere and the DJ in the corner won't really be doing anything....but it's a cozy place to go with a friend or a date and certain menu items are incredible.  The brie and apple pizza is unlike any other and they usually have a special pizza that can be just as amazing.  Also, the Three Cup Tofu, while a bit pricey ($9.50,) is fresh, unique, and so good.  Other than that, the menu is small and too expensive, so get a Caipirinha (one of the only good ones in town) and enjoy a nice, mellow night out."
2,"I prefer this location due to the fact it's clean,efficient,and the employees are courteous.\n\n   I've never encountered any issue's with my food, but be aware that sometimes that certain employee's may NOT understand certain words due to the fact English is NOT their first language."
1,ATTENTION LADIES: if you are coming to Las Vegas for a girls' trip with more than 2 people to a room do NOT book here. The bathrooms are painfully TINY! Virtually impossible to fit all hair and makeup needs. The room itself is nice with plenty of drawer and closet space. I was just shocked at how tiny the bathroom is. The toilet is right in your face as soon as you open the door. My recommendation if you have a few girls to a room is Planet Hollywood (double vanities on separate sides of the bathroom!).
3,Best Wings in Scottsdale. Big Wings served any way you like em. I prefer hot and I like the hot sauce cooked in not poured on top like Buffalo Wild Wings. Beer is served ice cold and the wait staff is super friendly. Kid friendly family atmosphere. Lotsa TV to watch games. Missed getting 5 stars because they play so many different games at once it's nearly impossible to hear the one you want.
3,"NOW I GET IT!!!! \""RAw SUSHI!\""\n\nVery clever.\n\nI was in Vegas for tamales in December (Yes, just for tamales. Really.) and tried to find Ra for a mid evening snack, but couldn't. Dunno where it went. Anyhow, last time I was there it was good stuff. It's not the best in Vegas, but it was certainly one of the simplest experiences I had there. It isn't worth cabbing to the Luxor for, but once you're there and you've washed down too many three-foot ra-aritas upstairs, come slide some RAw fish down."
2,They do a decent job on the cleaning. It appears to be disorganized. I have been going there for about 1 year. Several months ago they didn't get the cleaning done in the timeframe they said they would. The owner said he would put a credit on my account. They never did even after I reminded them on my next visit. They said they would speak to the manger when he was in. Nothing happened. Oh well
3,"HUBBA HUBBA! \n\nSexy, hilarious, jaw-dropping, raunchy. I always love the audience participation Cirque has. \n\nI think Zumanity is one of those shows that you'll either love or not think much of. There is no story line, just dirty humor, seductive acts, and always, acrobatics that make you squeemish or astonished or amazed throughout the entire show. I loved it. :)"
2,"I think I need to go in during the mornings to see the best selection of cupcakes. The times I've come here have been toward the end of the day and they don't have much left. That being said, I did try their butterfinger cupcake and it was pretty good. There is more frosting than cupcake, and I'm not wild about globs of frosting, but if you're a frosting lover and a cake hater, you'll be stoked on the proportions."
2,"Good value, pretty good food.  I give Sultan's props for serving middle eastern in a culinarily lacking location.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The food was relatively good - especially considering the price - $6.99 for lunch special which ends up at $7.50 with tax.  The restaurant smelled a little bit like public restroom (the cleaner) which was kind of a turn off."
2,"First things first, the food is great.  This is the only Shanghai place in Chinatown (I think) and their food is as close to authentic as Vegas can get.  I especially love their specials menu on the back where if you order one entree, you can get a soup for a little extra charge.  You can get a lot of food for under $10.  \n\nWhen I went here, I ordered these noodles with beans, peanuts, mushrooms, tofu, and meat in a special sauce.  I think they're called Eight Noodles or something, but I love these.  Only Three Village serves these noodles.  Slightly spicy, piping hot, and al dente noodles, this was my favorite dish.  \n\nI ordered it with the hot and sour soup.  Normally, restaurants add too much sour and corn starch so it becomes almost gelatinous.  Here, the texture of the soup was perfect as well as the balance between sour and spicy. \n\nThe worst part of the restaurant, however, is the service.  Never before has the service been such a killer of my good-food feel.  I'm pretty tolerant of bad service, too, but the waitress ignored our table the entire time.  Even worse, there is only one waitress.  When I went, there was only one other table, and she spent 15-20 minutes conversing with the table while I had to get up and service myself.  Worst service.  Ever."
2,"I really wanted to give this hotel a 5 but I just couldn't! I have stayed at South Point hotel numerous times and have always heard that Grandview was a nice place to stay and within walking distance. So my husband and I finally decided to give it a shot. My step-son was with us. So a suite seemed ideal! Overall our accommodations were ok. The bed within the bedroom was comfortable. The sleeper sofa was ok. The kitchen was a nice size. The pool was freezing cold. Considering it was over 100 degrees outside, cold sounds nice. But somehow the pool was actually too cold. Overall, Everything was just ok. I guess the problem is that I actually think that the rooms at South Point are better. In fact, I can think of several hotels in Vegas that are far better than this. I just felt disappointed. The person who checked me said he was giving me a recently remodeled room! It wasn't remodeled. The decor seemed very old and outdated. I don't think I will be staying there again!"
0,"I choose the regular oil change service for $24.99. This included oil, oil filter, top off fluids, check tire pressure and clean front windshield. The premium service is $34.99 and includes everything mentioned but will also add washing all windows, visual inspection of brakes and vacuum the interior. In addition to my $24.99 service I had my coolant topped off for another twenty cents.  The reason why I gave one star is because I was charged the premium price but got the regular service. This could have been just a mistake but according to the service checklist on my receipt they did charge me for premium services. So I inspected under the hood and noticed they didn't top off the coolant, which was an extra charge, didn't fill the radiator overflow, didn't wash any of the windows and didn't vacuum. I even had to check to see if there was fresh oil in the engine. According to my receipt all these services were completed and checked off.  If you're looking for a professional shop to work on your car I suggest you take it to another place."
4,amazing staff and always takes time working on our eyebrows...very professional and friendly that's why we always come here:)
4,I am so sorry. My account was hacked by a asshole ex-friend . I love your store. The original has to stay up while I'm going through legal crap. I am so sorry. I would never say that. I love your heels. I wear them whenever I can. I am so sorry. I love your stuff.
4,"This is the BEST casino... well maybe \""gambling hall\"" is a better way to put it, on the strip!\n\nThey have cheap drinks.  Good food.  and a SUPER nice staff.  The folks that work here are just really nice.  The pit bosses, the bar tenders, waitresses, everything.  \n\nThis is my number 1 casino."
0,"I miss the old set up. Now you put sticks in your bowl for what meat you want rather than self serve. They charge $4 for extra meat which you used to control yourself and they got rid of the most delicious protein, the sausage! Between paying extra for shrimp, extra for more meat, and extra for 2 bowls this place just makes me feel like they are nickel-and-diming you. HuHot on Junction rd it is from now on, better value with all you can eat and more protein choices for a better price."
2,"This isn't just some typical bookshop and its specialist nature might mean that it might not be of interest to all.  What this place does offer is a range of books about Scottish history, Scottish literature and rather surprisingly a range of travelling and educational books that seem a little out of place.  Also on, however, bringing us back to Scotland are some prints that are guaranteed to be of a certain age, but this perhaps is a specialist item.\n\nThe prices are fairly reasonable, but perhaps tending on the slightly dear side.  That said you do get a good range of quality books that are hard to find elsewhere."
1,"Prices on the main menu are outdated. Ordered an appetizer sampler (11.99 on menu) supreme nachos ($6.49) and 2 drinks. My receipt did not have the prices on it. I thought I heard $23 over the phone which sounded fair but it turned out to be $33. They should update their prices, but if they did, I probably would not have ordered in the first place.The nachos were good but the items in the sampler were unseasoned and bland."
0,"Tried to kick smoking, went to High Life to buy what I needed for vaping  Felt decent about the purchase, but not good about the experience.  After arriving home and looking at other local stores I noticed I overpaid, and was sold knock offs.  The first battery never held a charge and the charger I bought was defective as well.  I tested each product independently.  Upon trying to return the broken merchandise within 24 hours, they offered no return nor exchange.  All sales final.  Fine, I get it.  Fool me.  A company that can't even stand by the products they sell is a fraud, cause the products are junk.  Also the knock off equipment could have exploded and caused great harm to my home or person.  A cheap battery from an unregulated plant could overheat, explode in hand make me a lefty for life.  A defective charger could start a fire in my home and kill everyone nestled in their beds.  Go somewhere that cares about you, the community and proper business ethics.  I understand profit, and bottom line, but I dont support taking advantage of uninformed customers.  This is not a vent, just an event log so you can make an informed decision.  Dont believe me, fine, read the other reviews, everybody seems real happy with this establishment."
1,Place way over priced
1,We went here for a celebratory dinner.  I envisioned high end service with a smile.  It's all an appearance.  The waiter was nice but frowned the entire evening.  We were there for late reservations so they weren't even busy.  The food was unimpressive.  Over price and over rated.  I won't waste my money again!
2,Lately i have been feeling homesick for asian food and been hitting up places that i haven't been to in awhile.  Recently re-visited Thai Pan for a quick lunch and quickly ordered without spending too much time perusing the menu.  It looked more diverse than I remembered including some Vietnamese additions.  I remembered the curries and stir-fry dishes were ok but nothing really memorable.  A quick summary for my latest visit:\n\nPros:\n- convenient order-at-the counter setup\n- self-serve drink station\n- brown and white rice mixture\n- friendly and gracious owners\n\nCons:\n- too much napa cabbage in comparison to green vegetables \n- wish the owner/chef would be back in the kitchen vs. managing\n- spice level on the weak side
2,"What can be said about Kaba Curry? No, really. What do I say about it? There's nothing remarkable or memorable about it. It is a little place in the commons building that serves Japanese/Hawaiian style curry dishes. It's... curry. With rice. Sometimes other things. I know I'm being overly descriptive but that's just what it's mustering out of me. I mean just take some curry, pick a solid ingredient, and combine. I've just summed up Kaba.\n\nI do remember kind of a cool idea - a curry \""grilled cheese\"" sandwich. Just curry poured between a couple slices of white bread. There is potential here but it needs WAY more.\n\nIf you're in the area, really want curry, but don't want to go to Chinatown (and probably get it a little cheaper) then this is your spot."
0,"We ordered from this place last not and I am not happy at all. First off the lady on the phone was not pleasant, she seemed annoyed to take my order. She said it'd take 45 minutes to get my food delivered and it took an hour and a half. The food they did deliver however was not what I ordered. And it took another 20 minutes for MY food to get to my house. And two guys showed up this time in two seperate vehicles which I though was strange. I don't have a problem with that I just thought it was abnormal. They then had the nerve to ask for the other order back and then I thought that is super weird and not sanitary at all!! THEN the two guys proceeded to unpack that food and repackage it in new containers and bags I'm guessing in hopes to deliver it to the right person! EEEWWW!! They put their customers health at risk just to save food and money. NO THANK YOU! Then they left their TRASH on my wall outside my house (the empty styrofoam containers and the ripped plastic bag) because they apparently don't know how to throw anything away! When I sat down to eat my food it was ice cold and it was not very good. Needless to say I WILL NOT be ordering ANYTHING from them EVER again! I don't know what sort of place thinks they can get away with something as disgusting as that! But I hope they read this and change their ways because they're gonna make their customers very sick if they keep operating this way."
2,"3.5, but more of a 3 than a 4 so I'll round down.\n\nThanks to Groupon, I was well fed for the rest of the day for only $8.\n\n- Smoked Turkey w/ Egg and Cheese on a toasted Honey Oat Bagel: WIN!!!\n- Ham w/ Egg and Cheese on a toasted Whole Wheat Bagel: LOSE (ham was too salty)\n- Chicken Salad on Whole Wheat: LOSE (too much sodium)\n- Coffee: Not a win, not a lose either\n\nI'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu (and to use up my other Groupon offers). \n\nAs far as the service goes, I didn't have any issues with the workers there. They weren't overly friendly, but they weren't unfriendly either."
2,"The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of my top burger spots in town just opened up The Barrymore at the little-known Royal Resort just off the Strip, and I was more than excited to see what else they had in store for me. I've read a few things about the place since it opened, plus the pictures of the interior looked like my kind of spot so I really had some high hopes that I would be walking into my next go-to restaurant. All of these things surely added up to a great burger right? Not so much.\n\nThe restaurant itself has a great interior; contemporary, hip, kind of reminds me of the Vintner Grill but maybe a little fancier. There is a really small bar at the front, and I think two different dining rooms, seating a total of only 50 people I think so reservations are probably recommended. The Royal Resort is pretty cool as well, the lobby could still use a bit of work with their ceiling tiles for example, but I'm sure the average person won't notice this.\n\nThe menu looks great, I would definitely go back to try many of the items that sounded delicious, but as usual I'm there for only one thing. I did manage to sneak in the lobster mac & cheese before the burger came out; it was decent but not amazing for $13. I've also heard from many people that they have a fantastic cocktail menu which I wasn't totally in the mood for on this visit but would definitely be willing to go back for.\n\nThe Steakhouse Burger on the menu is listed as grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic aioli. That's quite a lot of flavors packed into one assembly, and I was almost nervous as to whether all of those would be able to stand out or if some would overpower the others. The burger came out with a very strange looking bun, and pinned with a wooden steak with the lbs logo on it which I thought was odd, but made me even more excited because I haven't had a bad burger there yet. Maybe it's because we weren't actually at lbs but this wasn't up to par. The meat had good flavor, was definitely cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the toppings and bun added up to something just short of working for me. As predicted, I think the toppings all kind of got lost together, although if you isolated and pulled out individual bites of each they were quite good. The bacon marmalade was probably my favorite, and the bun really detracted from everything for me. The bun to meat ratio was ok, but the bun itself was very dry and just really odd. Overall it was ok, but not at all what I was hoping for.\n\nThe fries were good; they had a bit of seasoning and good flavor, and luckily were included with the price of the burger otherwise I'd say the $6 for a side order of them is a bit much. My friend ordered asparagus instead of the fries and we were sadly charged an additional $7. I understand that some menu changes come with an additional fee, but I wasn't too crazy about that line item on our bill even given the 'fanciness' of the restaurant. If we hadn't done any strange swaps, our meal would have come to $27 for the two burgers which isn't horrible given the location just off the Strip as well as the interior of the restaurant, unfortunately I thought the burger was just ok. My friend liked hers, but I thought it could be better. If you want to spend about the same on a really great burger I'd say go to Holstein's if you're on the strip or lbs if you're out in the suburbs. But if you want to check out a really cool looking restaurant and eat some other great food definitely check this place out."
1,70$ on Hotwire... Nearly double that after sundry fees added up. Lacklustre hotel otherwise. Go to a chain hotel instead.
3,the food is awesome... but the hostess are not nice....
1,"Don't eat here! \nI was so excited to stop by Vegas and have some authentic phillipino food but it ended with huge disappointment! \n\nThe meat was not fresh and not prepared/cleaned properly. The taste of meat odor was overwhelming, especially the liver. (I am Asian. I eat everything but onion, garlic and ginger.) I couldn't keep the food down my throat and ended up puking everything on to my plate. \n\nThe only dish that was ok was the Pancit.\n\nMy boyfriend grew up eating phillipino family friends' food. He was quite disappointed too."
3,"Great sports bar, tons of TVs with all sorts of sports.  Food is pretty good for a bar.  I ordered a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was prepared very well, it was not over cooked as most non-seafood specific places tend to do.  Server, Meghan, was very nice & kept my drink full.  Free wi-fi is always a plus."
3,"We had a restaurant.com certificate so we decided to take our friend here for his birthday before the Counting Crows concert at Mandalay Bay beach. I made a reservation but I think it was kind of slow. When we walked up, it looked completely crazy but I think a big party was waiting to be sat. \n\nOur server was friendly and efficient so no complaints there. We ordered calamari and an 18\"" ham and pineapple pizza. Everything was really yum. The ONLY complaint I have is that the pizza could've used a bit more cheese. The crust though, omg. I LOVE thin crust pizza but hate how sometimes it gets too soggy or other times it's too crispy like a cracker. This crust was just perfect. It was crispy on the bottom, but soft and chewy on top. If the pizza had more cheese, it would have been AMAZING and deserving of 5 stars. I'd like to go back and next time request extra cheese.\n\nAlso, I got the berry martini and it was TINY and tasted like juice. At $10 a pop, I'd skip the drinks."
4,"The salad bar here is by far my favorite in town, fresh and various, big portion and reasonable price. The pizza is good. The Asian noodles section is actually the previous Ming's Table team, authentic HK food, the XO seafood undon is awesome and beef noodles with tender is pretty popular, too. The sandwich bar has the very cool Caprese sandwich! And last but not the least, must try the cold caramel macchiato here, way better Starbucks."
3,"Very nice accommodations. Centrally located to everything. Walls are a little thin. We heard the couple next in the room having some \""morning relations\"". Very clean and modern. Would stay here again. Helpful staff."
2,"Food is pretty good.  Prices are pretty high in my opinion.  Staff is really friendly and food comes out quick.  If it wasn't overpriced, I'd be more inclined to give 4 stars."
4,"Great food! I love their nem nuong, it's the best I ever have.  This restaurant is a subsidiary of the famous Brodard Chateau in OC. I love their banh canh tom cua, bun bo hue. Great place for Vietnamese cuisine in LV."
0,"Ill give that hotel 1 star or motel style ,no cufe in room  i asked Y ?they told me even belagio  hotel dont have ,are u comparing to that !!! Slow as speed internet , no buffet. Away from strip its not worth it"
4,"My first experience was a wonderful one.  Not a big fan of crawfish, but loved the shrimp soaked in hot n juicy sauce.  I can inhale a whole pound myself.  Mmmm... protein yay!!!!! Tasted my friend's super spicy crawfish, I swear my lips were comparable to Jay Z's.  Service was fast and friendly.  Except for the homeboy with the glue on black nails.  I hope he wasnt the one cooking up of crawfish.  God knows what is in those freakin press on.  YUCK.  Price is very very reasonable.  The pound of shrimp purchased was only $9.99.  No need for rice.  Must get cajun fries for $1, a dozen of sausage for $4, corn $.60 each, and potato $.60 each (potato is not that exciting, id rather get a corn)."
1,"Not Impressed at ALL!!!  Had to wait nearly 45 minutes when we were told the wait was 20 minutes.  I really didnt enjoy standing in the middle of the parking lot waiting for my table!  When we were finally seated I felt right at home because our table was also in the parking lot! LOL!\nI planned on ordering the eggplant lasagna - until my friend pointed out it took 45 minutes to cook - no thanks.  I want outta here quick.  Instead I ordered the Lady is a Scampi - I will describe it as strange.  My friend ordered a pasta dish also and a side order of the Giant Meatball.  When the \""Giant Meatball\"" came out it wasnt giant it was all cut up in the sauce - aka meat sauce.  One good thing was the food came out quick so once we were finally seated we were outta there quick.  I wont be back."
1,Oh Capriotti's you've been disappointing me lately. I have always been a fan since I tasted my first sandwich several years ago when I moved to Las Vegas. However for the past several months this location specifically has been getting skimpier and skimpier on their meat. \n\nI'm a simple turkey sandwich on wheat girl and when I first started ordering these a few years ago there was so much turkey on them it continually fell off. That's not a problem for me! However the last few months I have noticed there is less and less meat and the topper today was when I got my sandwich and about 30% of my bread wasn't even covered. \n\nI hope you get it together since your right in my neighborhood.
0,"Manager's attitude:\nFirst, with party of 25, mgr only wanted to give us 2 tables to fit 25 people. We requested 3 tables, first we got a big fat \""NO\"". When I turned my back and start walking out, half way walk to out side, mgr changed mind to said \""yes\"".  I could take this business to anywhere else yet family started arriving. By the the of dining, restaurant never reach 80% fill\n\nSanitary issue: \nThis restaurant mixed drinking serve water glasses to guest with dirty dish tray on the same cart! \n\nPissed poor services:\ndim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..\n\nOnly table who did the family style order got their food as their order.\n\nForever food:\nPork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing. \n\nOrdering:\nTry to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant \n\n\nBottom line:\n\nI HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND TO EAT HERE ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. SANITARY ISSUE, BAD SERVICES, FOREVER FOOD WILL NEVER SHOW UP FROM MENU,"
0,"So I have had it with the lousy software updates, with each new rendition of iOS, from 5 to 7, getting worse and worse, as well as introducing new bugs that are not resolved. \n\nIn total, I have replaced my iPhone 4 once, and my iPhone 4S TWICE, all within a year of purchase. Usually its some sort of battery charging issue, it goes like this, the phone gets REALLY HOT the day before the battery fails, and very soon after that, it no longer holds a charge. It may stay at one percent, maybe it drops from 100 down to 0 in two hours or less. All THREE of the 4-Series iPhones did this to me. And it usually happens right after a hotfix patch.\n\nIn particular, I have had a bad experience with THIS Apple Store. In my final iPhone 4S fiasco, I went back to the Apple Store to get it replaced because its still within the range of one year since purchase. Everything went smoothly, supposedly. \n\nThen on my way out with my refurbished replacement model, I was immediately stopped by two of the male Mac geniuses that sort of look alike (they refer each other as \""Clark Kents\"" as some sort of inside joke). They told me to follow them back to the Genius Bar, only for me to realize that apparently I am accused as a thief as they sternly questioned me about \""Where was the old iPhone?\"".  Only then, did the stocky blonde girl (the Concierge), managed to show them that she had it, AFTER I started YELLING at the staff that \""the blonde girl has it\"". She FUCKING LOST THE OLD IPHONE that I gave to her in exchange for the replacement! If I hadn't made the Geniuses drag her ass back out of the break room in the back, I probably would have been arrested for a false felony grand larceny charge. \n\nAnd then it got worse, on my embittered way out of the store, NEW replacement phone in hand, the Geniuses actually followed my ass out profusely saying fake apologies. \n\n\nI no longer am one of those Apple fans. There is no amount of empty \""Sorry's\"" and fake smiles that can draw me back. \n\n\nHere is another story, of a different Las Vegas Apple Store experience.\n\nMy MacBook Pro, which I bought 3 years ago, is in need of a battery replacement according to the diagnostic tools that its been warning me with. \n\nBut, given how I was treated at this store, and the Town Square Location (they aided a thief who stole this very MacBook in reformatting and deleting the Undercover Mac software before selling it to a pawn shop, and I had to call Metro's Property Crimes Division to use the personal information I acquired through screenshots by Undercover to get it back), I refuse to purchase or request services or support from any Apple Retailer. \n\nIn fact, I even wrote a negative Yelp review of the Town Square location upon discovery of my stolen MacBook (through Wifi-Router GPS screenshots) a few years ago. I was complimented by many other Yelpers for my \""slick detective work\"" before it was mysteriously deleted months later by Yelp. I included screenshots of a thin caucasian male Apple employee that was reformatting my formerly stolen Mac, this evidence was also taken by my Undercover Mac software. \n\nI am considerable getting some sort of Android device as replacement. I realized I should have snapped much earlier, but my older brother is some sort of die-hard Apple fan that really doesn't want to let Steve Job's dream go. \n\nI however, am very willing to burn bridges. Especially built by those who turn on not just me, but their crazed consumers. You can Google it, there was a lawyer who sued a Apple Store, search for \""Michael Deverett\"" from Toronto over a plethora of stolen Apple products. He won surprisingly. \n\n\n\nRight now, I am digging around my laptop to see if I can find those old screenshot photos I have that implicated the Town Square location. But instead of submitting THAT along with photos on Yelp, which would surely be deleted, I am going to put it up on Google Maps.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nFound some of the implicating evidence for the stolen laptop incident years ago at Town Square. However, I remembered that it wasn't all the screenshots. It may be in my external HDD back at home, i'll check again when I get back. \n\nNote: \n\nIf these reviews get deleted, I am merely going to repost backups onto Google Maps instead."
1,"$27 for dinner. About 8pm last saturday night there was about an hour wait.\nThe place was crowded, so much so that it seemed a little dirty, like they couldn't tidy up fast enough. \n \nThe bad:\nThe ginger ale tasted extremely watered down.\n\nThe stone crab claws were already cracked somewhat, but I tried a few different ones and was unsuccessful at getting anything OUT of them and also managed to slice my finger open trying. Friend got some of the snow crab legs, but they just looked soggy and aged to me.\n\nI was excited to see the brie and bacon mac and cheese, but was promptly disappointed by the quality.\n\nThe decent: \nThe lamb was good and not gamey. Crepe station was pretty neat- long wait, and not Spectacular, but worth it.\n\n\nOverall, I don't remember a darn thing about this food. So very unremarkable.\n\nand the good: \nthe reason this place gets 2 stars is the Creme Brulee!!! I lucked out and snagged some, but a friend went to get dessert and came back without, saying the chef was caramelizing the tops and they weren't out yet. I went back to try the remaining desserts and she asked me to pick her up a creme brulee, but they were out again by that time.\n\n\nCaesar's buffet is the same price and I'd recommend that. We had been there 3 weeks prior, about the same time (8pm Saturday night) and there was no wait."
2,"I know, it's hard to believe...this was my first time EVER eating at a IHOP. And it was okay. \n\nThe Good: \nI thought the decor was really cute, they have these walls with windows that kind of give it a cottage feel (i feel weird saying that for an IHOP...But its true) \nI waiter JESUS was super nice, and thanked us for our order and coming in. I thought that was special because most restaurants don't thank you for your $$.\nthe french toast was SIGNIFICANTLY better than the blueberry pancakes. the syrup was overpowering on the pancakes\n\nThe bad: \nthe meal is 9.99 compared to the exact same meal at dennys costing 3.99\nthe hashbrowns were cold and hard. \n\nNext time Ill go to denny's since neither place is fancy, might as well pay less."
2,"Zumanity - the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil\n\nI don't know if I'm quite sold....\n\nI heard great things about this show, and I was really excited to see it.  It was hot and raunchy, but some of the skits were kind of.. unnecessary?  I know they're trying to add comedy into the mix.. but some of it was just blehh..  Random?  I was expecting sexy costumes, sexual acrobats.. I guess there was some of that.. but I was hoping for more.\n\nThe hostess.. or host.. (it was a guy dressed in drag and he was AWESOME at it!) was pretty good.  I really liked how she would engage the audience and ask, \""So what does this make you want to do?\""  It's always such an awkward response - hilarious!\n\nThe black girl with the African ensemble was freaking AMAZING.  She had the body of a goddess, and her dancing was hypnotizing.  Terrific performer.\n\nThe singing was ok.\n\nThe dancing was ok.  \n\nMore acrobatics please.  I like the fishbowl skit.. MORE OF IT!!\n\nThere was just too much talking.\n\nIn the end, I was just not turned on!  :P"
0,"The bartender at Geisha was not friendly nor had a smile on her face ever. She became annoyed and hostile with us when having to correct our order. We asked that our edamame could have less salt and her response was \""That's not possible.\"" Not sure where her customer service skills were hidden but I sure hope she finds them in a haste manner.  Wishing her the best of luck since it seems like it will be hunting for a needle in a haystack."
3,"Pretty good place to eat a burger, Without spending too much."
2,the drinks are great... im sad that they dont server food anymore... the food was pretty good... an the happy hour was cheap... I get off one night  from a long day at work... i stop by to get a drink!  so i order a tall hefeweizen beer... slowly calm myself down... totally hits the spot..!!  good atmosphere... stop by!!
2,"I feel like I could use a bigger pool area for this hotel...  it kind of seems to me like they had nowhere to put the pool so they stuck in the first space they acquired. Also, their lazy river isn't long enough, nor connected to the main pool (which is too tiny anyway) and you're not allowed to have drinks while floating in the river.... I mean.... it's Vegas, if I can walk down the street and drink I should be able to float and drink, if anything happens that's what they have life guards for! \n\nOverall I'm not too happy with this area, I feel like they could have gone a little bit farther beyond and maybe placed it on the roof of the building or put more effort into making the surrounding buildings not look so over-powering of the pool itself... luckily most of the life savers and servers (guys and girls) are hot so there you go; eye candy.\n\noh, but I forgot to mention... there are WAY too many kids... so beware and I wish you luck."
3,Went here on a Friday night around nine and was sat right away. I chose the Chilean sea bass and my dinner companions chose the bone in ribeye and the new your strip. After sampling everything I would have to say the ribeye was the best. We also tried their oyster Rockefeller and it was delicious!
4,"We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt, their prices are fair and I trust them. They won't try to sell you a replacement unit if your current equipment can be repaired. After 25 years of great service I wouldn't think of calling anyone else."
0,"CAN I GIVE NEGATIVE STARS???????\nPLEASE READ MY REVIEW\nI just literally walked out of here 10 mins ago. I am so so so mad at this place i wish i could swear on yelp. First we go in.. Nobody greets us. Then they put ure feet in this plastic bag thing for 20 mins waiting. While we are waiting they are yelling at each other the whole time. I get no relax in vegas and i come to the spa and it is louder than the casino???? Then they say we should do the 35$ massage cuz its better than the 20$. So we say yes. I get massages 3times a week at least(not here). This was by far the worst massage ive ever had and i had hundreds of different people work on me. I went in just cuz it was cheap so i wanted to try it out. The massage was TERRIBLE. Then i go out to pay my friend said lets leave 5$ tip each so 40$ and i said even though they were horrible i cant do that and i try give them 25% tip. They look at the money im handing to them and they look at me and they look disguste with the 25% tip. They tell me everybody tips 20$ or more for the massage. So i tell them the massage is 20$ to 35$ and ppl tip 50% to 100%???????? And they said yes. They said 10$ each is not enough for them cuz they worked hard. Best part! When i handed the money while they looked disgusted at my 25% tip. They said \""THATS IT????\"" How is 10$ tip on a 35$ service get that kind of attitude? Im a good tipper and a nice person. The massage sucked and it was like 30% tip almost i was giving to these rude ppl!!!! So because im a pushover i ended up giving them 35$ on a 70$ bill!! 105$ and they didnt even say thank you. I just got robbed and had the worst experience in my life. Don't ever go here. This place should shut down and go out of business. Train your workers. They suck."
4,Always great for a variety of wholesome foods and desserts! Everything is neatly organized.
3,"San Gennaro Grill is probably one of the last places you'd expect to go for a burger on the Strip, much less late at night.  I just stumbled upon this place because I had a late night craving for burger, was in the Venetian at the time, and needed something to absorb the big pomegranite martini I had earlier.  It's in the Venetian food court and is open really late.  I was a little turned off that it cost $11.50 for a mushroom swiss burger, but you have to expect that with anything on the Strip.  The burger was surprisingly good though and it satisfied my craving for the night.  Thinking that it was a fluke for that night, I came back again the next night and ordered the same thing.  It was still good, just as good as some of the upscale burger joints on the strip.  Would I go back again?  Maybe, only if I'm at the Venetian and don't feel like going to Grand Lux Cafe late at night."
4,"This is the gem of University City. \n\nIt's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot, with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses. At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. It's commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesn't overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking you're anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. \n\nThe Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some well-treasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. It's very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldn't wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. \n\nIt's worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers. If you're single, the last one is especially fun."
2,"Very expensive and they sell nothing for vegetarians. All the frozen food is basically stuff that is terrible for your health. I guess you could buy some vegetables and rice and make something that will not put you in an early grave, but otherwise it is for people who do not care about decent food or their health. \n\nFor example the crisps section is bigger than any other individual section in this entire store. Seriously. \n\nAnd would it kill you to sell some vegi burgers? \n\nOh they make some of their own bread which is nice and open until 11pm, which is a plus."
0,"Bartender charged me $29 for a Bellini that was just champange!! rip off city, don't stop here."
4,The hotel rooms weren't the best but Kenny at the bar was awesome. Super funny and nice and really knew his drinks and cared about his customers!!
3,"Janet Lynn's was pretty much my entry into fine dining as I grew up and went to university, as an incredibly classy and romantic anniversary. It's been my go to place for special occasions ever since. \n\nThe menu doesn't change much but the service is just so attentive that It keeps me going back. The room is lovely and maybe a bit stuffy, but it is a welcome change from the restaurants that are closer to the universities. I did feel out of place at first because we were the youngest people there, but our waitress was so nice and helpful with everything on the menu/wine list.\n\nWhen the food came I did scarf it down (possibly to the chagrin and scoffing of the table next to us) but it was so delicious. The duck and chicken were so delicious as was the creme brulee for dessert.\n\nForget Symposium for first dates, take him/her to Janet Lynn's for something romantic, memorable and elegant."
4,"Awesome check-in deal and not so pricey to begin with... the receptionist was nice, they had free wi-fi and actual current magazines besides like Motorcycle Monthly and WebMD that you usually find at other auto repair places. Big plus, they have tons of free stuff like water bottles, cookies, tea, ice cream, coffee, etc."
3,"Carol has done my makeup for me for special events.  She says she gives me the California girl look.  In any case, I always dazzle after Carol works her magic.  I highly recommend her for make up, make overs, and facials.\n\nCandy Stone\nStone Talent"
0,"Probably the worst Vietnamese place, I have experienced! When it comes to costumer service this hits a all time low. After being seating at a booth for 15 minutes, I had to flag down a waiter for the menu (Minus a star)! It seems the like the waitress and waiter are all gathered around the cash register talking amongst themselves to care! We have to inform the waiter that we never got any cold water (Minus another star). The waiter decides to gives us an attitude when we was placing our order (Minus another star)!\n\nWARNING: The establishment itself is a OVEN!!!\n\nLacking AC in this weather is not a welcoming place to dine. When I ask about the AC the waiter claim it is working (on) and the heat is cause by the weather outside! Sorry that was a load of crap! I posted a picture of the thermostat of the restaurant and it reads 90 Fahrenheit. I am not a high maintenance person but temperature that high ruins the dinning experience. \n\nThe food is nothing to rave about! The chicken dish was dry! The grill pork and egg roll with vermicelli was decent! You could have gotten this in another Vietnamese restaurant. I could not imagine eating Pho here because of the heat! Personally with the lack of AC (Las Vegas being so hot) with bad costumer service, I would NOT RECOMMEND this place based on today experience!"
0,"I've been here 6 or 7 times and at first fell in love with their carne asada burrito. This love was short lived as every time I take my first bite the wrap completely apart due to the pico sauce water. Here's where the 1 star comes in. Service leaves a LOTTT to be desired. EVERY time I've ordered the same thing, and every time it takes 1/2 hour on average for the burrito to reach my table. There are 2 people eating inside the restaurant and 1 in the patio area - it shouldn't take this long. My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times. 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration. Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again. Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later, but as I finally got up the courage to complain, the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies. I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that, I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore. Good Luck guys!!"
2,"I've been here a few times, and service hasn't been bad. When we actually got service today, it wasn't bad either. That's why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 1. In the first 10 minutes we were there today, 3 servers walked right past us, including after we got the attention of one girl. They appeared to be socializing with another table. Our server was very attentive, as I said. She did a great job. The highlight of our trip was when one of the hostesses walked past out table yelling, \""Someone's gotta pee! Someone's gotta pee!\"" over and over again. I guess in my profession that's something one keeps to oneself."
1,"My wife absolutely loved her turkey burger, and the fries were decent if not spectacular.  So why the 2 star rating?\n\nThe service was absolutely awful.  This was at the South End food truck meet up on Friday night.  By the time we got there (8ish) the lines were dying down.  My wife ordered from here while I went elsewhere to order.  The line was longer where I went so by the time I got back she was already waiting for her food.  Then we went to Common Market to pick up a couple of beverages.  We came back and my food was just coming out.  Hers was nowhere to be seen.  It was another half hour before it came out.  I was watching the whole time and it wasn't like they were overloaded with orders - it took them between 5-10 minutes to put out each order.  Absolutely crazy!\n\nMy wife liked her burger so much that she said she would eat there again, but it will have to be without me because I won't wait."
4,I have been going here for the past 3 years. I love Dr. Ito and his staff! Everyone is so friendly and Dr. Ito is hilarious!! I never feel like they do work on my teeth if it is not necessary. Michelle the receptionist is the nicest person ever and will always walk through the steps with me of the payments or work that I need to get done. She is always so patient and accommodating! I would recommend anyone to go see Dr. Ito!
2,"It's important to know that Smashburger is more than just burgers.  As someone who doesn't eat hamburgers, I had never thought to check this place out until now.  You can get any of their burgers as either a grilled or crispy chicken sandwich.  Win!  (They also offer a veggie burger).  I ordered the local special, which came with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, and jalapeno slices.  Everything was very fresh, even the guacamole.  I was a little surprised at the size of the crispy chicken breast, as it seemed a tad small - I guess because I'm used to the super-sized ones you get at a lot of restaurants.  It was certainly more than enough food, just caught me off guard.\n\nOverall, it was a very good sandwich, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries as well.  The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is that it's a little on the pricey side.  $12 for my sandwich, a water, and some sweet potato fries.  Not going to break the bank, but enough that I couldn't eat here for lunch every day.  I will say though that for the occasional treat it is worth it.  I do feel that the freshness and quality of the food justifies the price."
2,"Went with a large group of 8 for a business dinner.  The service was a bit lacking - our waiter seemed to disappear at times and prolonged the dinner.  It was fine because we had a lot to discuss, but out out-of-town guest were probably tired from a long day of training so it would have been nice to make dinner a bit shorter.\n\nI ordered the penne rustica and it came to the table in a piping hot bowl.  It was nice the put a plate under it and I definitely devoured the whole thing."
4,"Great service, great price, great work and a quick response time. What else can you ask for? I highly recommend Chavez LawnCare."
0,"Uggggg....\n\nOK, so I used to love Luna when it was on campus.  LOVE. IT.  Which I guess is why I have repeatedly attempted to continue my love affair at the new location.  \n\nFirst and second, I went with a group for brunch.  The place was nearly empty the first time, but we waited forever for the food.  My second trip, our group had reservations and we still waited 45 minutes! I enjoyed my breakfasts (poached egg  with lox) but the service was suck.\n\nThird (and I'm afraid final) visit was a disaster.  This was another large-ish group (about 12) with reservations.  Drink orders were taken but never filled.  Our food orders were not taken at the same time; not even close.  I was the last person to order food (by about 20 minutes) but the first person to receive my meal.  On the other hand, my husband didn't receive his dinner until after the rest of us had eaten!  All of this happened while thirsty patrons are still waiting for their first drinks.\n\nI ordered risotto that night.  Mistake.  It was like a sticky sort-of rice pudding that was cold and just all wrong.  The very delicious-looking fries were sort of like my risotto, cold and wrong.  The steaks that my friends ordered looked great, but some were not cooked to order.\n\nI think the most annoying part of the night was that the restaurant will not accept more than two credit cards from a party.  They will split up the check, but they will only allow two parties to use plastic.  In this day and age, I don't know how this kind of policy could even be imagined, but we asked the waitress to combine some checks so that we could accommodate.  Of course that was all wrong and took another half hour.\n\nI also wish they wouldn't cram their tables they way they do, especially next to the door.  It's so cold, loud and crowded.  And by the way, on our way out the back to parking lot, I could hear all of the employees in the kitchen yelling about how they couldn't wait to get out of there and that they hated being there...my sentiments exactly."
2,"I walked into this place thinking: \""Oh man, you know the Americans(white dudes) are going to love this place\""  Flat screen tv's, nice tables, friendly service, trendy ambience, waiters who speak good English, white guy playing sitar at the front....this is white guys paradise...unfortunately the food itself was just above average. FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \""Americans\"" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \""The spiciness wasn't there\"" review\n\nIn terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\""Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\"" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.\n\nAnd to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys. So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate?\nDon't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj"
4,"This place is awesome. Tasty burgers and fresh cut steak fries. Tons of options from the classic burger toppings, to saut\u00e9ed garlic and pesto! You can also get fried eggs or even pastrami!\n\nThe feel is super chill and great music. Sherl, the owner is super cool, and always helpful for first-timers.\n\nThirsty? How about one of the 16 flavors of lemonade?! I've been searching for the best burger in Phoenix, and this is up there with the chuckbox near ASU, Ted's in Cave Creek and Lucky Boy as far as a \""great burger\"" goes!"
2,"The website has a $2 off coupon, so that makes a men's haircut 13 bucks, but you have to tip, so it comes out to $15 anyway. Nothing great about the haircut really. The girl who cut my hair was nice and we chatted during cut, but she was very young and inexperienced. Nothing got destroyed on my head. It was a middle of the road cut for a walk-in. Might be better if you were a regular and knew someone here that you trusted. Still, it was a very friendly place and a good one-time cut if you need one quickly (i had a 10 minute wait at 11am midweek)"
4,Great customer service and well priced rentals. Good advice on trails to take and local sites to see. My buddy got a puncture (complete with sunstroke) and a member of the team came out to meet us and replace the tire.
0,Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat
3,"I love donuts no matter how you spell them and O Face Doughnuts delivers.  Their staff is super friendly and the donuts are great.  I got the Maple Bacon w/ Maple Mascarpone one and it literally was one that needed a fork and knife. So great and if you're a donut lover, check this place out!"
0,"Terrible! They deserve 0 stars honestly! I have been here twice, both WITH appointments and still have waited over an hour and a half to be seen. The 1st time Dr. Tran was very rude. I came in for a blood pregnancy test because I wanted to be 100% sure I wasn't pregnant even though i had a negative pee test. (I was over 2 months late.) & there HAS BEEN CASES where a pee test hasn't detected the pregnancy hormone. He tried to get smart with me saying he had never seen a case like that, & I honestly wanted to just be like, \""Idgaf what you have seen or not, give me a damn blood pregnancy test and be done with me!\"" BUT...lol I contained myself and said, \""Wellllll, I STILL want one!\"" He gave it to me and I left. This last time, I walked out. Apparently I signed into the wrong list (drug testing) and I had already waited over 20 minutes of my appointment time which was at 11am. The drug testing guy said, \""Don't worry, I'll take care of it.\"" So then I walked up to the LOVELY receptionists and asked how much longer I was gonna wait and one of them while on the phone had the nerve to look at me and slightly roll her eyes and say, \""Its gonna be another 45-1hour!\"" I mentioned I had an appointment and another receptionist which was nicer said she apologized for the inconvenience but that everyone had arrived at the same time. She calmed me down from the other bitch that had snapped at me. If you're reading this BITCH, you need to learn some FUCKING people skills and respect appointment times. That's why appointments are made you STUPID BITCH! I will never be back here again."
0,"My experience here has left me with no words. Bad service. Mediocre food. I can definitely say I'm never coming here again. It took over 20 mins to get our table some water and the waitress didn't own up to her mistakes and blamed the busboy for not bringing the water. When we got the water, it tasted horrible. Our hotel room sink water tastes better than that. The food came so late as if they left to catch the fish we were going to consume. The waitress then forgot to put in one of our rolls and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying it was a \""human error\"" as if she wasn't even sorry about it. As we received the bill, my friend realized she got spicy tuna when she had wanted yellowtail. All in all worst place ever! The only decent person was the busboy. Avoid the waitress with a feather tattoo behind her ear."
2,"The place wasn't too packed it looked like your average \""after work\"" crowd...the server was quick and informed us of their happy hour specials. I decided to go with the strawberry margarita; it was pretty good and strong. We decided to order off their \""munchies\"" menu, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari, it was cooked perfectly not too chewy and you could really taste the mix of salt and pepper...  and the mozzarella wedges were your standard fried cheese concoction served with marinara. I also ordered the wings in hot honey sauce which surprisingly were really tasty, they weren't hot at all but the sauce had a great sweet smoky flavor to it. Also some random ordered us a round of Washington apple shots so that made the food taste even better! I will def. be back to try some more food off of the regular menu."
2,Expensive for what you're getting.  Food is good.
4,"I love FEZ!  I was first turned on to them when I went to Devoured and they served some kick@ss foods.  Then I took my old lady self and my little old lady girlfriend to eat there--asking first if she minded that it might be a gay hangout which is what I heard (she didn't)--and wow! I am so glad we came.  I had a turkey burger thingie with artichoke, red peppers, etc. on it.  Very good! \nThen we ordered a tiramasu and split it--fantastic! \n I love this place, didn't feel out of place cause we were two gray headed old lady heteros eating there and loved the food and service. \n I hang out alot at the Phoenix Art Museum, so FEZ is getting another visit next week from me with another old lady hetero friend..ha!\nPretty soon people will be gossiping that FEZ is being taken over  by little old gray headed hetero Grannies eating there....bwahahahahaha!  We're taking over, peeps, so make way on that bar stool, honey!"
2,"Stopped here on the way back to California.  Not the best Dennys experience I have had.  Our waiter was Arturo... didn't say his name, and reached over the table (and our food) during our meal to exchange the condiment rack.  Really that couldn't wait till after we were gone?!?\nOtherwise the food with standard, hot,  served quickly, and was very good.  I had regular coffee and the seasonal pumpkin pancake grand slam, with a lot of the whipped butter on top. That was good!\nWas disappointed that they don't have caramel coffee anymore.  But hope to see it again in the future.\nOverall it was an average Denny's  experience, and I would return when in Phoenix again."
3,"A must visit when you are in the downtown area!  Love this place!  When you go to the top, it shows the Vegas Strip (which is best seen at night).  I never experienced the rides, but did go to the show and love the casino itself."
1,"What's up with this place ... it is not open during posted hours. Chairs are turned upside down on the tables, door locked, and an [Open] sign is still hung in window. I was there 8:00am (closed) Fri. 4/1 - posted hours 7:00am. I was there 9:00am (still closed) ... what's going on? Also have driven by in early afternoon, closed.\n\nTheir ad in the 4-2-11 Chandler Republic states:\n\nNow Open Melted Cheese Kitchen\n\nopen 7am to 3pm Monday - Saturday for Breakfast & Lunch\n\nwhat gives?\n\nI'm willing to spend money and the place is not open."
0,"This place has changed! When I first moved here this place was great! Not so much anymore.. Waited 15 mins for our waitress to even come over to us (& it was NOT busy!) we ordered our food & she quickly hurried off.. Waited another 30 mins for our food.. Which when was brought over I had a big pile of guacamole onto of my food when I just explained to her not to put it on ( highly allergic!) .. She laughed and said sucks that it's guacamole & you can't just scrape it off.. \n\nFood was still amazing, but the service just put a bad taste in my mouth!"
3,"Tis good.  Very unique food.  I love the bread, it's unique.  You definitely will be full when you leave.  They also have ginger soda which is amazing."
0,Save yourself and try somewhere else. The taco and relleno plate was just horrible. A mush of egg and bad cheese. Taco was dripping oil.  My sister's huevos rancheros weren't much better.  Bland tomato sauce.  There is better food out there.
2,"My visit was very disappointing. The wait wasn't long for a table. All of us got AYCE so we planned on sharing everything we ordered. Everything I ordered the first round our server wrote down on paper. The edamame took over 20 minutes to come out. That was already disappointing. All the rolls came out a little after that. The 2 orders of Dynamite, grilled shrimp skewers & cucumber salad which is usually pre made was never sent out. I had to ask about the dynamite 3 times. I ordered a second round of sushi. Maybe 5 rolls. One of them was a baked roll & the server said it would take longer cause it's baked. Funny cause that's the roll that came out first! All the rolls came out & I still didn't get my Dynamite. When it did come out I started laughing cause the serving was the size of my palm! It wasn't even worth waiting for. The restaurant is nice inside. Small thought, but nice. The service was just terrible. My boyfriend has been here before & said the service was way better last two times I came here. Maybe it was just out server. She was the only one not in uniform. Just wearing a white shirt. \n\nThe buffet is priced at $24.95 per person not including drinks.\n\nThere is nothing special at all about their sushi rolls. If you look at the specialty menu they all say \""in:California roll\"" or \""in:shrimp tempura\"" with just different stuff on the outside. \n\nI will not be coming back here!"
0,"NEVER AGAIN!! Went for lunch with my wife on a Wednesday.  We sat at 12:25 PM.  We ordered the Kibbie and  two Chicken Salad Rolled Pitas.  We asked to have all of the food come out together as we were in a bit of a hurry.  We inquired about our food at 12:50 PM when we noticed guests seated after us were served some appetizers.  We also commented that the gentleman who was seated just before us finished his meal, paid, and had left the restaurant.  Our server mentioned that our food would take longer because we ordered food that had to be cooked.  We sat and sipped on our drinks until 1:10 PM and we could not take it anymore.  We asked for our food to go.  The hostess/manager apologized and offered to throw in desserts.  We declined the desserts, and she comped the Kibbie.  We waited another 10 minutes at the front door as our food was still not ready.  As we walked out the door the hostess/manager mentioned that a trainee was in the kitchen, and that was the reason for the delay.  It was a frustrating experience, and I will not go back.  You cannot have a weekday lunch go an hour without any food.  It is inexcusable."
2,"I'll admit, there are some very intricate details and amazing displays of the human body in its truest form. The dissections done for this exhibition seemed to be very carefully performed, and it was amazing seeing the muscles of the body and more delicate parts of the body being preserved so well. All areas of the body were covered, going through numerous systems, and going from the outside layers to the heart and other organs.\n\nHowever, the price for this exhibit was pretty steep ($34) and we weren't allowed to take any pictures of the exhibit. Moreover, I thought that there would be more things to see at this exhibition. It took my sisters and me about an hour to go through the whole exhibit. I felt that I was a bit cheated since it seems that Body Worlds has so much more to offer.\n\nIn general, I think it was a delight to see an anatomical exhibition for the first time, especially since I'm so interested in anatomy, but right now you can visit San Diego and see the Body Worlds exhibition in the San Diego Natural History Museum for only $27. Boo."
2,"I came here for breakfast and have been wanting to come here for a while.  Its a bit of a drive for me, but I finally decided it was time to go.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience and enjoyed my time here.  Its a fast casual type resturant, where you walk in, place your order at the counter, and they walk the food out to you.  They seem to have a nice selection of food, mostly breakfast with some lunch items.  \n\nI went for breakfast, and wanted to keep it simple.  I ordered two eggs over medium, with toast and potatos.  I found the toast to be a bit dry, and a bit to dark for me.  Usually I like my toast a little lighter with butter on it, but that was not the case.  Also, I found the potatoes to be a bit bland and boring.\n\nI will probably be back, but was not blown away by this place.  I rated it high becuase I think overall its a good place, and the food isnt that half bad."
0,"24 Dec 2012     actually a 1/2 of a star   for business practices.                                                                                                                                                     I been a member of La Fitness since 1999.  I now live Citrus Heights CA.  La Fitness does not have any gyms here.  I'm been trying to cancel my membership since November.  the first person told me I could do it through via web get  letter of cancellation and  mail it . I am having problems getting on to the La Fitness website.  I just called again to yesterday 23 Dec 2012  and the young lady told me the manager is not there to speak to me and the  ONLY and I quote \""the only way you can cancel your membership is to go into any La Fitness gym\"" .       I'm in Northern CA , I can not spend  three hundred dollars to fly back into Phoenix AZ, rent a car and go to the LA Fitness to cancel my membership.  So I'm waiting for the manager to call me.  I have already written to the BBB, because you can not charge someone who has relocated and ask them to stop by a LA fitness to cancel their membership.  please   That is bad business practices.   I will promise to keep this up to date.  As soon as I hear any info I will let you know. \n\nThe one thing I would love La Fitness to do and supply cleaning spray and paper towels to wipe down equipment.\n\n\n I will not change this rating until I know La Fitness has cancelled my account and is not charging my account."
3,"Cheba Hut had a vision from an Amsterdam trip and is growing the dream to legally sell Chronic, ATF, Kush and more. \n\n   I get the special of the day because this is a rare place were most of the sandwiches are worth the try.  I also treat my self to a rice Krispy treat.  The restaurant has been seen as a great concept and can be found in many states. Its great to see a business find success with a Hippy concept.  \n\nErik T. thinks Subway is great, go ahead man yelp about all the great subways in AZ I can't wait to read them."
4,"I have never had bad food from this location. It's clean, the staff is friendly, the food is stellar! Seriously, I don't go to any other location because they've set the bar so high, I'm usually disappointed if I go anywhere else."
2,"I've never actually gone inside the convenience store here, but this is my go-to gas station along the 101.  I drive all over the East Valley for my job (selling real estate), and Chevron's gas is well-known to be one of the best you can put in your car, so I go out of my way as often as possible to go here."
3,"Not as high calibur and fresh/diverse as Ghengis Grill.\nLunch specials is around 9.50 a bowl per person.\nIncludes drink and soup and wonton crisps.\n\nMeats are usually frozen and rolled up so get a tissue paper to stuff it into your bowl.\nPress!\nchicken, pork, beef. choose.\nI usually get pork.\n\nchoose your veggies such as mushroom, zuchini squash, bean sprouts, tofu, etc.\n\nThrow some rice noodles into your bowl.\n\nAdd sauce. Add at least 5 to 6 scoops or you won't even taste it.\ncooking oil, sesame oil, lots of spicy thai, chili oil -- thats the way I like my food.\n\nHand it over to the Grill guy and wait.\n\nGet your finished food, grab a drink, utensils, soup, and go seat yourself and eat.\n\nThere are no servers so that saves quite a bit on tips"
0,not very knowledgeable. . . came in for an inline 15 amp fuse and holder . . . The dude couldn't find a 15 but suggested his 30 would be fine!! Might as well have connected the wires and waited for something to melt ;-)
2,"Compar\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres hotels, le prix est plut\u00f4t dans la fourchette haute, et surtout il n'y a pas de tarif sp\u00e9cial pour les enfants...\nLe choix est assez vari\u00e9, m\u00eame si on peut d\u00e9plorer l'absence de sushi dignes de ce nom. Le traiteur italien est aussi d\u00e9cevant.\nEn revanche les pattes de Snow Crab sont d\u00e9licieuses, et la viande est plut\u00f4t bonnes aussi.\nEnfin les desserts sont probablement ce qu'il y a de mieux, aussi bien d'un point de vue gustatif que visuel."
1,"We went to the KFC on Chandler Blvd. & the I-101 to get the 8 piece Family meal $19.99 + .99 (10 piece tender bites on special) for our visit to my 96 yr. old mother in law on Sunday.\nShe loves KFC! \nI was quite disappointed in the price to quantity ratio. All 8 pieces of chicken fit in the same size box as the 4 piece biscuit box. The 3 chicken legs and 2 thighs looked the same size as wing drumettes. The 2 wings would not keep a sparrow aloft. The breast, although a little larger, was dry. The 10 piece Tender bites were also dry and the crust had come off in the cooking process. The sides were ok. Cole slaw, 4 dry biscuits, potatoes and gravy. I could have consumed all the chicken myself and still have room for sides and dessert and I'm not a heavy eater. \nI have visited many KFC's and they are all the same. It's not just this location. \nAbsolutely NOT worth the $21.00+tax for me but worth every penny for the smile on my mother in law's face! :-)"
4,"It's nothing fancy, but I'm a huge fan. Lots of TVs that the staff will gladly change to accommodate a sports fan. One of the few places in the valley that will show soccer games without being asked too.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and know how to have a good time too. It's definately a good place to be a regular at, but they treat the first-timers just as good.\n\nFor a sports bar, the food is super good. I'm a huge fan of the mac n cheese and I ask for some Habenaro paste in it just for the added heat. So good! The green chile burger is another yummy choice. And if you're ever in the mood for beer and wings, you're completely in luck!"
1,"Located in the newest Vegas hotspot The Cosmopolitan Hotel, Wicked Spoon was more like Weak Spoon as my expectations for the establishment fizzled at my first spoonful. \n\nOffense number 1: There were no crab legs. Really? Why are there no crab legs? If Paris can do crab legs, why can't the Cosmopolitan do crab legs? In all seriousness, they have crazy (ugly) $500/night rooms and ridiculous $20-60 cover at Marquee, minimum $25/bet tables and you can't even foot the bill for my crab legs. The hell? \n\nOffense number 2: Bland food. From the eggs benedict to the deserts everything was bland city. \n\nWhile the food lacks taste, it definitely makes up in presentation. All of the food is nicely presented - from the glass case full of french styled mini deserts to the individual take out boxes and egg benedict pans - it definitely brings self-serve buffet and hour d'erves to a whole new level. Sadly the food is not nearly as good as it looks and I felt like eating the bag of chips in my purse more than the food that sat in front of me. And although the presentation was nice I found getting the food back to my table to be a pain-staking process as my plate was not big enough to house no more than two or three of these mini pots/pans/boxes. I don't know about y'all, but if I'm grubbing at the buffet, I am grubbing. Period. \n\nI will never return and encourage all my friends not to experience Wicked Spoon. It's not worth it. Save your money, do yourself a favor and eat at the Wynn Buffet or Paris. They're much better."
4,"This is my fav place to eat at while in Vegas.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  The salsa bar is awesome, and the fajitas are incredible (I get the shrimp).  The food is great here, the service is also perfect, and I love the atmosphere as well.  Rarely have waited for a table either.  Usually play poker at the hotel, then walk over for dinner.  Highly recommend."
4,Great experience. So fun!!
1,"Ok the food is worth trying I will give them that. But the way they lie and treat you the customer is just awful. We originally ordered catfish and they came back about 4 minutes later and told us they didn't have catfish. A customer walked in about 20 minutes after that and when the waitress said they didn't have catfish the big man that runs the place spoke up and said \""yes yes we do have catfish\"". I think he only told that customer they have catfish because he is biased. I am white and they didn't want to serve white people the good stuff it was only for their special guests or other black people. The waitress didn't smile once; when i asked if they had coca cola or dr. pepper she said \""NO!\"" in a very hateful tone and looked at me like i was scum. I felt like I wasn't welcome there the whole time I was there. Gave me the suspicious eye. Let's get rid of the prejudice people. We. Can. All. Get. Along. Anyways if your black, they will call you brother or sister and give you the royal treatment but whites should stay away unless you want shitty ass service."
3,"I recently brough my car up to Edinburgh from home, where it had sat on the drive pretty much since I had left home to go to university.\n\nAs I'm sure you can imagine, it was pretty filthy, so I pulled up here expecting to shell out \u00a35 or so for a crappy was that wouldnt really be that great.\n\nNeedless to say, when I realised that the cheapest was was \u00a32, i was suprised and I was even more suprised when the car came out looking like a million dollars.\n\nVery impressive for \u00a32, but thier prices can go up to around \u00a36 - which I'm sure must involve so many polishes and waxes and cleans that dirt must be simply repelled from the body of your car, never getting dirty again."
1,"The cocktails are great and so is the chopped salad. That's it. Had two entrees and an app and they were just ok. Waiter was so sweet but honestly I cannot believe how many people don't have good taste and gave this place 5 stars. Next time I go, I will sit at bar, have some drinks and a chopped salad and be done."
4,That burger joint is good. I get the double char and its the best I will definitely return soon
1,The music is out of style! The view is really nice but its definitely not for a 21st bday!
0,"After sushi in China Town, I had the idea to go get foot massages with my boyfriend. Found this place on yelp, and the reviews seemed good. We went there and they had a special going on. 1 hour for \""full body.\"" Sat down and was really sketched out. It was almost creepy. The massage was decent, I've had much better and they were extremely rough. Not rough as in the pressure of the massage but rough as in they were tossing and smacking our limbs around. Not to mention the two massaging us were whispering to each other the ENTIRE time!!! Not relaxing AT ALL!!!!! Honestly, save your damn money. This was a joke. Never again!!! I almost forgot! They hustled me into tipping them more than they deserved! I was just trying to avoid a fight. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!"
4,"This is one of the places I recommend to everyone. We are here at least once a week and if for some reason we don't get out there that often - we crave it like crazy.\n\nThe french press coffee is awesome and I am a big fan of the bacon wrapped filet bacon sandwich. The hubby loves the chicken & waffles. We both love the country fried steak BUT sometimes it has too much fat on it for our liking.\n I love the ambiance and great service.\n\nWe try to get there early enough to beat the rush and when the weather's right, we love eating on the patio with our dogs.\n\nHighly Highly HIGHLY recommend"
3,"Maru brings back the pride in Korean cuisine which has been downgraded in AYCE korean bbq joints with a profusion of lesser quality meats.\n\nMaru's Dolsot Bibimbap is in an authentic dolsot (stone bowl) making the rice crispy and chewy.  They serve it sizzling hot and mix it tableside for you, if you wish.  All of their meats are of superior quality.  You can actually taste the different inherent flavors of beef and pork so you dont have to drown non-marinated meats in sauce.  The Galbi has a tasty marinade and does not have an excess of fat.  The Black Pork Belly and Jumuluk (sliced beef in marinade) are also my favorites.  \n\nThey serve a variety of appetizers including a generous portion of their house salad.  The first time I tried Maru, they had seaweed chips which were crispy strips of seaweed sprinkled with sugar and sea salt. Yummy! I never saw it again though...\n\nI give Maru 4 stars for setting the bar in Korean food, cleanliness, and for the owners, an old couple with a sense of humor, who makes it a point to make their rounds and talk to the customers.\n\nPS:\nBeware of Maru's specials like the AYCE sushi and $9.95 korean bbq dishes.  There are a lot of fine prints.  So if you have the moola to splurge on quality and not quantity of Korean food, this is the place to be!"
3,"I really like what The Huxley have done to this space, and especially on their menus: both food, and cocktail. \n\nPreviously the Rutland Bar, which had been around for a fair while, a makeover and change of name can do the world of good. I always liked the Rutland, but it felt very much like a bar to have meetings in, or a subdued drink. \n\nThe Huxley has a great vibe midweek. I've yet to visit at the weekend. But yknow what? As far as a bar for a mid-week after-work drink and munchies goes, it's pretty good. I've heard amazing things about their burgers and hot dogs. I will be back to try these (the burgers come with two patties per bun?!)\n\nWhen I came, I tried a Grapefruit Mojito and it was really fresh and delicious. When a bar isn't specifically a 'cocktail bar' I can be very suspicious. So many times a cocktail can come unmuddled, or with chunky ice instead of crushed, and it can just taste like watery, alcohol with a sprinkling of fruit. Not at The Huxley. I happened to meet the mixologist at the bar, who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some cocktails for me. I love this kind of energy and passion. There were some delicious looking numbers there too.\n\nThe food menu is also really unusual, inspired and different. Hot dogs are, well, so hot right now. But there were also nibbles like Poached Duck Egg with black pudding and chorizo. Or a Scotch Dug Egg with HP sauce. Or Mini Chipolatas with dip, which I had. And the Battered Sole, with a side of seaweed salad.\n\nNote: do not put half the seaweed salad in your mouth at once. It tastes like the sea. Like the sea and fish. I used to have a through-and-through phobia of fish. It was not pleasant. I am assured, however, that a little nibble of the seafood salad is quite pleasant.\n\nThe Huxley is a new bar, and new bars take a while to settle into themselves. I hope it goes from strength to strength, however, as you can see they've put a lot of thought into the new food menu, the cocktail menu, and the new decor.\n\nNow, when can I go back for a burger?"
1,4stars to DJ !!! \nI got hyped by the music that DJ played for us.\nHe played songs that are mixed from old funk to pop songs.\nTransition between songs is really smooth. \n\n0 stars for the bar. Cocktails were not worth the price.\n\n(4+0)/2=2 stars
4,"Massage, massage!! I am visiting from out of town and wanted a massage. They were great on getting my sceduled in on last minute. I had a neck and shoulder massage from Lawerence and i highly recommend him! I typically dont like massages because I just don't have luck with finding someone good. He was great and will come back when I visit again!"
1,"Well there is no food, beer, music, or anything else for that matter here.  Its the health office.  This is where you come to pay $50 to watch an hour long movie about washing your hands where they give you a quiz, but after the movie the instructor gives you all the answers allowing any average joe to come get their health card.  Get here at least an hour early before the scheduled movie time.  The waiting is ridiculous, but hey thats how government works.  Inefficient as possible."
0,"Went with another couple to get caught up over Christmas time.  Horrible service right from the start.  Had to ask for everything.  Loud obnoxious group there at the same time so forget being able to hear your own table if there's a crowd.  Took forever for our food to come.  Forever for the check, which was NOT worth the price. First and last experience there.  Too bad cause we're locals who love Mexican food."
0,"This place was just ok. We sat outside and it was very loud but that is not the restaurants fault. We loved the chips and salsa and were looking forward to our meal. I ordered the fish tacos and hubby ordered the short rib enchiladas. I was shocked to see my tacos, they were so small, like an appetizer, the tortillas were smaller than fajita sized tortillas(which is the size I expected). There was a chunk of fish in each taco( there were 3) but the piece of fish on one of the tacos only covered half of the tortilla. So, I take a bite and although presentation was good, these tacos were so bland to me. I tasted a hint of lime but that was about it. Hubby said he would rather eat Taco Bell! He said the taste wasn't horrid, but his dish was way overpriced. Service was horrible, we were  checked on once during our meal by our waitress. We had more interaction from the bus boy!!  The water we were served was barely cold, after filling our glass once, we were given a carafe of room temperature water. I guess their ice maker was broken. We ordered the guacamole, it was good, but way overpriced as well. It came with two oversized chips to which hubby and I both exclaimed \""that's it?!\""  Maybe we both got bad dishes, or the chef was having an off night and forgot to season our food. If you are recovering from the flu and need bland food, I highly recommend this place. :)"
2,"Somehow Asian food just works at night...Noodles is inside the maze of the Bellagio and it's pretty large. Service is ok, but it's sorta expensive. Like $18 for HK style noodles. Given how complex it is to get in and out of hotels, and if you are craving asian food late at night, I'd go to Noodles...."
0,We went to rescue a baby kitten and was turned down because I didn't want them contacting a landlord due to fees . I think it's sad they turned it down and when my bf said he would keep it at his house they still said no because they didn't want the kitten at my house . SO we had to find a kitten another way. Sad they say to rescue fur babies but we couldn't our kids were sad leaving this place instead of happy .
3,"I almost don't even want to write a review for this place. It's so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just don't know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So I'll attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint:\n\nA. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that we've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. You're welcome Lodge. \nB. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said. \nC. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I haven't seen him around much lately and I'm pretty sure that's why I've been at Kelly's more recently)\nD. Black-outs\nD+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above. \nE. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea. \n\nThe only reason why there's not 5 stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way. \n\nOh The Lodge. Such great memories here...and most of them are just hazy bits and pieces."
4,"This is the best place to come when u have a seafood craving. I always order the snow crab, which are actually a very good size in legs compared to most other places. I ordered once the king crab legs and that filled me up really good. When u choose your type of seafood u get to choose the type of seasoning , such as Ragin' Cajun for me, and the level of spiciness, which fortunately for me they have non spicy as an option. My favorite also are their side red potatoes and their cajun fries. \n\nThey have a lot of tv's everywhere so it's great for watching the game. There's writing all over the walls and seats, but I think it's pre-made because there are signs saying they will fine u if you write on the walls."
3,Love this place the icecream is amazing my only complaint is they run out of cookies so I miss out on my favorites a lot . The salted caramel with a chocolate chip cookie is crazy good.
4,"Best place to get your beauty products, hands down. Everyone is friendly and helpful without being pushy. They have great deals if you sign up for their mailing list...sometimes they send cards in the mail with vouchers for a FREE full size product with any purchase. They have special ladies night out events with raffle prizes, and discounts on salon services. I have never left empty handed or without a smile on my face.\n\nFYI, they take ULTA coupons too!!! and you can stack them with your beauty brands take ten!!"
2,"I went with a buddy who swears by the cheesesteaks. I opted for a turkey sandwich with coleslaw and swiss. I will say I was impressed that they roast whole turkeys here for the sandwicehs, so no thin processed turkey on teh sandwich. I would prefer if they baked their own bread, but that's not a huge deal. I ordered the \""small\"" sandwich, that was stil huge! all in all, good turkey sandwich"
4,"GO GO GO, really GO!\nFood, Clothes, Entertainment and bargains and deals to be HAD!\nNeed something for your car, house, wife, husband hell even those little things that need supporting until there 18!!\nThis is a great place to visit and spend the day, they have a BBQ place there that holy jackanorie it's blinking amazing!"
4,"Love love love Kaleidoscope Juice! This is a busy person's dream. It makes getting extra nutrients &/or cleansing so simple. Everything tastes fantastic. My favorites are Gold, Dusti Beet, Kerri's Clean Green, & the Strawberry Protein Almond Milk. I've done several 3 days cleanses & i absolutely love the 1 day reboot when I'm feeling a little low on energy. I tell everyone about Andrea & Alexandra & Kaleidoscope. I've lost track but I think at least 50 of my friends, family, & client have done their cleanses (either as a group or on their own) & many say they pop in all the time for a juice or two. Wish these ladies all the success in the world, they're doing great things :)"
4,"I thought I had already discovered my burger place in Vegas and that was Gordon Ramsay's BurGR and no one could take that place from my heart.\n\nHolstein's though, came pretty close. But I think it was my zeal talking more than anything and my weakness for those little moments where a person can feel top of the heap just from buying a meal. \n\nYou see, I had hit it pretty big at roulette and craps the night before and was feeling confident. I knew going in that I wanted that Billionaire Burger, with its truffle aioli and foie gras, elements of a burger I know I would never eat anywhere else but on vacation. I did order it. And then some. That burger came medium rare, with additions of aged goat cheese and lobster, heightening an already indulgent, gluttonous, and decadent burger into a whole other realm. It was luscious.\n\nBut like I said, it wasn't fair. I made it luxurious because I willed it. Is the law of attraction in action? Perhaps. More than likely, though, it was me riding the high of a couple of wins and wanting to eat like a winner.\n\nThe philly cheese steak egg rolls were average. Nothing memorable or special.I also had a taste of the bamboozled shakes, the Tiramisu and the Fat Boy. Most gush about The Fat Boy but it was too candy-like for me. Boyfriend had the Memphis Burger, which had a layer of pulled pork that he believed might have been crisped up on the flattop beforehand to create a crust. I had a bite and was impressed but really, I only tasted it for the sake of tasting because I refused to part with, even lay down, my obscenely excessive truffle, lobster, foie burger, oh no.\n\nYou had better believe I am still thinking about that burger. Late at night, when all the lights are out, I reminisce about the taste of that false luxury."
4,i came here with my fiancee a little while back.. it's one of the more memorable places in all of scotland.. give yourself about 3-4 hours to full take in the entire experience.. and don't forget to get their early to avoid the lines..
4,Amazing sushi. My family (extended included) have been coming here for years and it's never disappointed. The School Bus roll and the Vegas roll are our favorites. The teppanyaki is always delicious as well. The atmosphere is so fun and is great for casual dining or for a special event. The staff is always very friendly and seem to remember us. Always a great time and always leave satisfied.
1,"I've eaten here twice, and I think brunch was much better than lunch. The high light for me was the made to order waffles and omelets during brunch, everything else was mediocre at best, the Chinese food section needed much improvements especially. \n\nYou can get 20% off if you sign up for their a-list club card. But for the prices, I would suggest you going to somewhere else~ like the Bellagio, or South Point for around $10."
3,"I drive by this place all the time.  First I look at the massive gym behind and think to myself that I need to work out.  As I think about working out I get hungry.  This is when I notice the Healthy grill.  Then I always say I'm going to check that place out someday and then forget that I need to work out.  \n\nI was at work and couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat.  I really didn't want a boring sandwich or something fried that was going to put me down at my desk.  Just then I remembered about this place by the gym.  I read some of the Yelp reviews and then I was off to go get my bowl on.  When I arrived the restaurant wasn't packed, but there was a few people and no line.  \n\nI really struggled to give this place 4 stars.  The reason was because the girl at the counter was really rude.  This was the first time I have ever been here and was asking some questions.  She seemed annoyed and just wanted to take my order.  I was upset because there wasn't anybody behind me.  After asking a few questions I finally gave up and realized she was visibly upset.  I though maybe I caught her on an off day or she just had a rush.  Oh well, there's really no excuse to be rude.  \n\nIn case you were wondering I was asking about the Jay Cutler bowl.  This bowl looked like a man's bowl of food.  It was huge!  I will have to order it someday.  \n\nI ended up ordering the small bowl because I didn't want a big lunch.  It was priced pretty well.  and it had vegetables.  I am amazed that the other places charge you for vegetables.  Really?  Other than the girl be rude the overall experience was good for my stomach and wallet.  If you are in the area or at the gym go check it out.  I hope you get a friendlier girl or guy at the counter.  Cheers!"
4,I'm a BBQ lover and Mac's is top notch! We got the 4 meats 4 sides platter and it was amazing! Everything was cooked to perfection and the assortment of sauces was great for the a variety of tastes!
4,"I was in Charlotte last week on business and found this restaurant on Yelp.  It was great.  Located in a renovated church, in a very nice artsy part of town (many of the shops seem to be located in renovated old houses).  They have an excellent wine list (bottles, by glass or flights if you so choose) - I had the Foley Pinot Blanc (very tasty!).  We started with the pate appetizer, then followed by the fresh Grouper.  It was perfectly broiled, moist fish sitting on top of a lovely bed of wilted spinach.  I also had side salad of fresh greens and nut encrusted goat cheese.  Then finished with Banana sorbet and cappuccino.  Lovely meal and service was great!  I'll definitely be back."
3,"Super yummy food, reasonable pricing and fun atmosphere. Big bar, tons of flat screens and a great happy hour- I will definitely be back!!"
0,"Prepare to be wowed. \n\nHigh class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked, \""may I try some of your french fried potatoes?\"" I was greeted with a crackled mutter as I inched my vehicle forward. I was then treated to a relaxing 15 minute wait as nobody moved in line. Perhaps it was the clientele, a 1992 minivan filled with some savvy locals. Perhaps it was the professional waitstaff, whom I could hear laughing and socializing through my window. Whatever it was, the dining experience was filled with culinary magic and spa-like service. After some deep meditation, I realized that perhaps tonight was not the best night to sample such fine delicacies so I pulled away. I cannot wait to return to this location and try my luck at trying these elusive fries. I highly recommend this palace of excellence."
4,"I think this might be what a drug-induced sex-less orgy might be like.\n\nLe R\u00eave offers a visually spectacular experience that seems almost unreal at times.  From what I understand, the acts for the show change from time to time.  The friends I went with remarked that the show, and even the stage (if one can even dumb the extravagant setting down to a single word), had metamorphosed since their last visit.\n\nAll I know is that I don't remember ever witnessing this level of athleticism and choreography in a show in... ever.  I liken it to some old-school Cirque shows I've seen in the past... on crack.  With disjointed acts, tied tenuously together by the theme of a dream, there are very few points where there isn't a smorgasbord of activity to feast your eyes on.  And the entire intimate space is used -- from the depths of the water to the dizzying heights of an out-of-sight ceiling, and from wall to wall.  There's doesn't seem to be a single cube of space that isn't involved in the show in some way.\n\nAnd that doesn't even touch upon the modular, insane, hydraulic contraption that serves a variety of purposes.  Attempting to describe the platform stage seems pretty futile.  You have to see it to believe it.\n\nThe same goes for the bodies of the performers.  I think if you summed the body fat percentage of the entire cast, the total would -still- be less than mine.  I can neither confirm nor deny that there may or may not have been just the littlest tiniest wee bit of eye-raping going on.\n\nPlus, shockingly, the tickets for Le R\u00eave were more affordable than those for K\u00e0.  It doesn't hurt that we happened to be staying at The Wynn, either.  Nothing like a little boozy boozy before-show action in the casino, followed by a heavy dose of delicious eye-candy."
1,"Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Quiet little independent Chinese restaurant that also has a Hawaiian style menu.\n\nNot many options for vegetarians, no tofu dishes to be found. Didn't really dig my noodles + veggies + pineapple dish, hence the 2 star rating."
0,"I went into this store in May to transfer my service from Verizon. The \""salesperson\"" that helped me assured me that Sprint will pay up to 350.00$ per line to come over to them (the ad at the time also indicated this). After 3 hours my wife and I walked out feeling as though the transaction went well. I sent in the final bill as I was instructed to do so to obtain my reimbursement. I was told after the fact by Sprint customer care that I was put into a program that wasn't \""eligible\"" for the reimbursement. I have fought for over 4 months now to get the money owed to me with no resolve. I don't understand why this store isn't being held accountable. I have every intention of not only filing a lawsuit against them, but doing everything in my power to let people know what these people are all about. I am in sales as well and understand having to meet a quota, but this should be done in a professional manner. Not by a bunch of kids scamming people out of their hard earned money with blatant lies. This entire thing has cost me over $600.00 dollars of my money. I was given $270.00 and told that the other line didn't qualify because of \""non eligible program\"". DO NOT GO THERE, you WILL be ripped off."
4,"Update on my recent experience, I went back in for my skinny boost which I'm in love with, but this time I signed up for the health coach. This is my first time ever having a consultant to talk to about my weight loss journey.. but I feel so comfortable with the people who work there and I look forward to going in every month! :-)"
0,This place sucks! Been there a few times and it has sucked every time. Wait staff is rude and slow. Food quality is poor. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
2,"Cheap Breakfast!  Okay, so the coffee isn't great, and the food isn't awesome, but for the price, 2 eggs, meat, taters and tortillas (as opposed to toast), I'm not going to complain a whole lot, except about the coffee.  The coffee was pretty bad and had to be doctored with cream/sugar pretty extensively.\n\nService was very very friendly.  The place was clean, and more importantly, the silverware was clean (unlike the place next door).\n\nGood food, good service, bad coffee. Pretty good, just not good enough to make me a fan."
1,"Meh. Exactly how I feel about it.\n\nOkay, I'll admit I'm new to this boba game.. I'm no expert on it.\nWe were in town square yesterday, and decided to have a small snack before dinner. I'm not into the tea, I like smoothies with my boba.\n\nFirst of all, you can get a much larger, and better blended smoothie at jamba or tropical smoothie, for about $2 less....and if you want to add boba to a smoothie, it's .50 cents.\n\nWe were the only ones in line, and it did feel like I waited a while for it. \nWhen I got it, I just felt it was lackluster. It didn't have a fantastic taste, and when I'm being charged for something I want added, I kind of expect it to last through the entire drink. I felt that I barely had any boba.... There was a single row that lined the bottom of my cup. The smoothie wasn't really blended either, it had large chunks of ice, making it very mehh."
4,"I am finally getting around to reviewing Crudo.  What a great experience! We did the full tasting menu and were impressed by every dish.  Our server was amazing and passionate about every dish. The crudo dishes were my favorite - the albacore with black garlic and truffle was RIDICULOUS!  I'm still craving it!\n\nI told our server how impressed we were and what talent the chef had...and jokingly I said, \""Is the chef  single?\""  We laughed our butts off when she said, \""well, he's actually my husband\""    I absolutely love the husband wife team making Crudo such a success.  You can taste the passion in their food.  Well done Chef Cullen and the entire team.  I wish you much success!!"
3,"thank you yelpers, this really helped in the 100 degree weather! never would dared to try the place on my own w/ its dingy house-like exterior. The custard tasted really fresh and a lot lighter than ice cream. but i give it 4 stars because of their limited selection. i wanted a butter pecan but the guy said he only had, vanilla, strawberry, choc, rocky road, and a couple others. i settled for the rocky road, but was dissapointed so i went back and ordered the luv it special (vanilla w/ pecans and moschino cherries) and that definitely did it for me!"

3,"My wife and I had a craving for Middle Eastern food. I checked on Yelp and found this place where our friends could meet us halfway. They bailed, but we went ahead and enjoyed a delicious meal. \nIt was a bit strange to be eating in an old 5 and Diner restaurant. None of the ambiance was changed except for the addition of the TV and water pipes lining the wall. We were there for the food.\nWe started off with the Baba Ghannoughe. The pit bread was okay and the Baba Ghannoughe was oily but edible. \nMy wife ordered a cup of Lintel soup with her Chicken Sharawma sandwich. The soup was excellent and she ordered a bowl to go which looked like a cup instead of a bowl. \nHer sandwich was okay...we got spoiled at Sabuddy when it was in Tempe and and then in Scottsdale, their sandwich was in the pocket of the pita bread and not wrapped like a burrito.\nI ordered the Shish Kafta which was 3 pieces of ground beef and lamb char-broiled with a side of onions & tomato and white rice topped with currant raisins. The meat was cooked just right...firm & flavorful and the rice was okay. It's a good thing I didn't eat lunch 'cause there were good portions on my plate.\nWe topped it off with Baklava...mmmm...so good."
4,"Moved to the NW last year and I have become a big fan of Roccos. The pizza is great with a full amount of quality toppings on each slice. You can choose pizza by slice or small medium and large. Pizzas are massive so choose wisely unless you want to take some home for later.\n\nThe menu goes beyond pizza and I am looking forward to trying the wide selections of pastas, soups, and breads. Roccos also offers Italian Gellato is also available to complete the meal. Soda, milk or juice for the kids, and a decent selection of beer or wine for mom and dad. Roccos is much more than pizza.\n\nThe dining experience is enjoyable at Roccos as well. A recently expanded dining area with added tables, arcade and small play area for the kids and flat screen TVs add to the family atmosphere.\n\nCustomer service is small town like, something rare in this city. Employees have paid for arcade games for my kids, given us free garlic bread as we waited for the pizza, lets us taste the wine and other warm gestures. They make you want to be generous with your tip!\n\nIn conclusion, after reading this review, you are now informed enough to not choose Domino's!"
3,What a great shop! They did repairs on my 95 Honda Accord and tinted a widow! Great customer service and will be back! I was referred by a coworker to AZM and let me tell you what a great feeling it is to find a great local shop!   Yep Im a fan!
2,"This place wasn't as great as I expected it to be after hearing all the hype about it, but it was still pretty decent. \n\nI came here in a group of 9 and we waited in line for about 30 minutes and were seated in a big round' table. We all ordered our drinks and food right away. I ordered a milkshake along with 2 other people in my table, but for some reason I didn't get mine when they got there's. I actually reminded the waitress about my milkshake when I was halfway through with my meal, so I ended up getting it to go because I didn't want to make everyone else wait. They seemed to forget a couple things because they also forgot my boyfriend's burger and we reminded them after waiting a while. \n\nAside from the forgetfulness, the food was decent.  \n\nCONS:\n-Forgetfullness\n-My boyfriend and one of our friends ordered cherry coke, but you could barely taste the cherry so they asked the waitress if she could put a little more syrup and they ended up dousing it with the syrup. \n-My \""shooters\"" had very little sauce, and the sauce that it did have was only on one side. \n-The large chili fries was definitely not worth the price. I could've made that with mcdonald's fries and a trip to 7-11\n\nPROS:\n-The seasoned fries was yummy\n-The specialty burgers were pretty delicious\n-The shake was bomb\n-Service was fast\n-They split the bill without us even asking\n-Prices are very cheap for a sitdown restaurant\n\nI'd like to come back to try their chili and other specialty burgers/"
1,"Wheelhouse lounge in Casino was very slow service. \""signature\"" Fries are terrible, fresh fish sandwich good but oily, Italian sausage ok, wedding soup was tasty. Large screen sports bar is nice but drafty in the back. There is better food in the Casino, probably won't go here again.\n\nForget this place, pay a little more and go to Andrews."

3,"This place is amazing!  The food feels authentic, the staff is incredibly friendly, fun and helpful, and if you go at the right time, you can watch the Bellagio fountain show while you eat!  \n\nThe most memorable part of the meal to me was the fois gras.  I've never had it before, but I've been told that if not prepared correctly, it can be a very negative experience.  I really enjoyed it and would definitely try it again if it's prepared as well as this.  \n\nThe only mark down I give is for the price.  It's definitely not a cheap place to eat, but considering all you get ambiance and food wise, it's defintely worth it!"
2,"First, I cannot believe that there is a category specifically for chicken wings.  But I guess there's enough people who love their wings and places that serve them to warrant it.\n\nSecond, why is Pizza Hut trying to market this place as a separate entity?  I mean they share the same location, phone number, and workers.  There's no need for the charade.\n\nBut the thing is the wings here are pretty good.  I don't know what exactly made them so tasty (I may have been half starved or buzzed or both) but I'll give it to them.  You got your pizza, your brew, and must have the wings to complete the third tier of the ultimate greasy diet. \nMmmmm grease.\n\nIt's too bad it took forever to get delivered.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-hut-las-vegas-36#hrid:x0l-cp-iYAYHgitAotWURw"
2,"Great location, great atmosphere, great patio. I had a goat cheese and mushroom crepe- it was delicious and the coffee was great too. The service was seriously lacking though- the waitress was crazy flustered, it's coffee and crepes... Calm down. The coffee bar gal ended up serving us and though she was better, we had to ask for all of the items we ordered, coffee refills, etc. It's newly opened so I am hoping to revise this review after they get it together."
2,"We went as a family with two kids...5 and 1.  The kids split a kids meal grilled cheese which was plenty for the two of them.  The grilled cheese was fairly large.  My husband had the meatball sandwich, again very good size, there was enough I could have a little.  I had a Cesar salad which was ok, it didn't taste like it was homemade, more of a bagged mix with bottled dressing, but a good piece of bread came with it.  \n\nTheir happy hour prices were great.  We were also happy with the beer selection.  It was very busy at 5:30 on a Friday, but with the amount of space they have we were seated right away."
1,"Same red/white colors as in-n-out however twice the price and half the flavor...very disappointing and i'm not even a fan of in-n-out.\n\nFor that kind of pricing model, you are better off going to Delux, Red Robin, Blu Burger or actually any restaurant or dive bar and you will get a better burger for the same price."
2,"Like most restaurants at the Biltmore Fashion Park (and malls in general), Sam's Cafe feels very corporate (and it is part of the Canyon Cafe chain), but don't let that hold you back here.  While there are better Southwestern places around, Sam's does a decent job with everything.\n\nI've done dinner and drinks a few times before, but most recently had happy hour stuff at the bar - with reasonably priced margaritas, and friendly bartenders too.  Decent, but so-so chicken tortilla soup and quesadillas.\n\nJake is right.  This can be a pretty good date place, when you go with a pretty good date.  My last dinner here was an awful date gone awry, but thankfully the food was the saving grace here (or maybe it was by default).  Let's just say that my date almost got a swift kick in the ass on the way out and my delicious chile-rubbed steak almost got thrown as a weapon Napoleon Dynamite style.  But I digress, back to the dinner.  The steak was cooked as I asked (medium), and had a great marinade with a flavorful spiced rub, but the chile mashed potatoes were OK, and thought it lacked that chile punch that I was hoping for.  While the food quality is OK here, it's just that - average."
1,"Don't sit at the bar...... No one helps you.\n\nThis is by far the worst service I have ever had. I love Grimaldi's the pizza is great but the service was just terrible. Up front stand three hostess' that cannot figure out how long the wait was. Each one of them said a different time, and were extremly rude. One finally said the bar was open seating so for the first time we sat at the bar. I noticed a huge party leave from the patio so I asked a hostess if the patio is open seating, it was not so I then asked if the wait was still as long. She informed me that people were ahead of me (which was understandable) however no one was waiting. So I went back to the bar and said its fine we will just deal with it. Some better spots outside opened up so we moved seats from in the bar to the outside bar area. I watched two tables stay open the entire time of our meal, which was 2 hours long. I was ready to leave had I been able to tell the waitress to cancel our order. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is becuase in the end the amazing pizza made up for the terrible service. I love the pizza and next time I think mabey I will order it to go."
2,"We had purchased one of the all day any buffet deals and were out trying a good number of them over 24 hours.  They charged us an additional fee to eat with them which I wasn't happy with.  The food was good and we enjoyed some different choices than you see other places.  Now were super friendly and people persons but it didn't matter here as the servers were not friendly.  From the register, to the hostess and server not many smiled or even cared to talk and the place was not busy.  Drink refills are not dependable even though they walk by or collect dirty plates.  For the food I give three stars but not the service.  My tip reflected my dissatisfaction with the service received and we normally leave good tips where we eat."
4,"For 18 dollars they do a phenomenal haircut, which includes a neck shave and massage. Crazy right? I always feel guilty and over tip. Best barber shop in downtown Phoenix."
1,They food is really good but usually takes about 15-20 minutes for them to make a sandwich.
2,Excellent service and presentation. Spectacular view. Wine list mostly a rip off although there are a few pearls hidden.\nSteak is mediocre and should be better from such a gorgeous high end restaurant (steaks tasted like choice not Prime in my opinion ). Not as good as last time I was here about 1 1/2 years ago.
2,"The dumplings are outstanding, but the noodles underwhelmed. They were a little too much like long, thin sp\u00e4tzle. Those dumplings, though. Dang. We had the veggie dumplings and the shrimp/chicken/whatever dumplings. Like, woa. \n\nAlso, the bubble tea was pretty top notch. The boba were just a *tad* overdone and gummy, but the tea itself was delicious. It was well above-average. \n\nMinus one star for slow service and greeting during a slow period."
3,"Would've been 5 Stars but they don't have a pool lift.\n\nA very cool space, nice staff, good food and drinks. All of this made for a couple of nice relaxing afternoons sunning by the Pool."
1,"What the crack. No.\n\nFood was not only unmemorable, but ridiculously priced and not delicious at all.\n\nI am not sure why we wasted our money and time here when there are so many better Las Vegan restaurants here.\n\nBe gone!"
0,"I wanted to like this place but sadly I didn't at all!  The food was horrible. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, pretzel and a corned beef sandwich. The best thing I had was the fries. The wine was borderline undrinkable. The pretzel was decent but the cheese sauce was gritty and almost flavorless. The sandwich is where the meal went downhill! First it comes out with soggy bread. The meat is dry and has no flavor. The inside of the sandwich was cold while the rest was burn-your-mouth hot. I took a bite and spit it up because it had a half of an onion on it. Imagine the outermost layer of an onion on your sandwich not sliced at all!  \n\nThe whole thing was bad!  The service wasn't horrible but the server wasn't around much! I would rather go hungry then try to eat here again. Yuck!"
2,I can't really give a polished review for this venue when I is be a runnin' late.\n\nI mean its spacious. The staffs nice. I could hear the show. Tall people should stand in the back. Didn't order any food maybe for the next show I will. Haven't really explored much of the venue itself...err...this review needs to be updated the next time I visit. Which will be soon so...yar... don't listen to me.\n\n3 stars.
1,"More pleasing to the eyes then taste buds.  The $9 ice cream scoop of guacamole was very tasty and the margarita was delicious...the filet mignon chile relleno  was probably the worst thing I have ever tasted...for real, and the chiliean sea bass was okay enough ..kinda fishy though.  So beautiful surroundings and good service but expensive and unpleasant tasting food.... Sorry I really wanted to like this restaurant.  I have never written a review before....that's how bad the filet mignon chile relleno was...tasted like they poured some Tommy Rockers chile on it."
1,"Just a bad night. Maybe but, bad service and food is unforgivable when paying big dollars. Nothing more to say."
0,"10:30pm on a Saturday night. My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first). Place is hopping. We take a seat at the sushi bar.\n\nThe Waitress:  \""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?\""\nMe: I have a sushi menu in my hand, \""yes.\""\nWaitress:  \""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.\""\nMe: What the fuck, bitch. \""Uh, ok\""\n\nDear Ra Waitress,\n\nI'm sorry if I kept you or any other employees, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed. It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine. I was hardly the last customer in there. There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me. If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food? Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot. I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined. Thanks for that.   \n\nSincerely,\nMorgan"
0,Poor food and really bad service.  We will never go back.
0,"Can't say \""it's the worst\"" airport shuttle service in Las Vegas simply because I haven't tried all of them. However, there's nothing good about this one. Best advice would be to avoid this company even if it's FREE!! This is if you would rather avoid a y hassles. It took over an hour and a half to get from the airport to my hotel (Vdara). On the return, I\nWas scheduled for 9:25Am pickup. By 9:35Am, called to inquire how much longer before the shuttle arrive to pick me up? They indicated they already came by and left at 9:25! They are very BIG LIARS!!!! I've been out in front of my hotel since 9:17 with no sign of the Showtime shuttle van in sight!! I should've did some research prior to paying for a round trip ticket!!! End up spending $14 plus tip for a relaxing carefree cab instead. Should've went with the cab option in the first place!"
0,"I live in the neighborhood and really wanted to like the Grind.  After 3 visits, I'm done.\nOverview: Food is mediocre service has stayed consistently terrible.\n\nMy last visit was happy hour with my 3 co-workers.  I had suggested we try the place and we arrived by 5 to make sure we got a table before rush hour.  \nAfter waiting to be served for about 10 min., the waitress finally spotted us & got our drink order.  We waited another 10 min. to get the drinks even though they were not yet busy.  We asked to order dinner and she said she'd be right back.  15 min. later she came to get our order.  We had an appetizer and 4 burgers.  Appetizer came out with the burger with no apologies.\nAfter we received the food our server disappeared, so condiments and drink refills were ordered from other staff.  When she returned she interrupted our conversation to ask if we were done.  From this point on she returned to the table with the check (not asking about dessert or more drinks) every 5 min. to ask if we were done.\nFinally, she came by and leaned in to tell us that \""it's getting really busy in here and there are people waiting for a table.  I'm not asking you to go but just so you know.\""  Are you kidding me?! We had ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 2 drinks each, & wanted dessert but she needed our table! \nUnreal. I will not return."
4,"Deeelicious!  The first time my wife and I went here, we were amazed at how NOT busy it was.  Every restaurant in the Phoenix area seems to be constantly busy - every day - but not this one!  Each time we have been here, we have either been the only people in the place or one of only 2 occupied tables!  Weird!  We asked our server about this and were told they do a lot of take-out business.  We have noticed this to be true on our visits.  Ok - on to the food.  We have had pizza, pasta, entrees, and sandwiches.  All of it was good (with the exception of one weird chicken parm), but the best thing is definitely the pizza!  We love their pizza, especially the Amante Special!  It is very very good!  The crust is tender and sturdy without taking over the whole pie.  The sauce is tasty but not overbearing.  There are always plenty of toppings on each slice.  The sandwiches come in a close second, with our favorite being the canadian bacon one - yum!  My wife says they have the BEST caesar salad she has ever had - sometimes she has to get 2 to satisfy her craving!  I would agree that the salads are good - I generally get the side house salad with ranch dressing.  It is always fresh and crisp with lots of veggies.  All-in-all we will definitely continue to eat at this restaurant!"
2,"My husband and I absolutely LOVE the food here. We literally live down the street and go way too often, but and I hate to say it, they have the worst service. If you decide to go PLEASE for your sake sit in the patio or at the bar, if you sit in the dinning area, expect to sit there for 20 minutes before being asked what you want to drink. Last time it took so long my husband had to get up and order from the bar just to have something drink while we still waited for a server to drop off menus. We will continue to go because they really and truly have AMAZING food. Hopefully they hire on some help or train their servers (NOT THE GUY WHO WAITS OUTSIDE OR THE BARTENDER, THEY\""RE ALWAYS GOOD) so I can rate this place 5 stars. The restaurant deserves it."
2,"Small but cute. The wait staff was nice and the place is clean. Good pizza, pasta needed to be drained a little bit more but the marinara sauce was flavorful.  The place was real hot however.  Not too comfortable.  However, it won't stop me from trying it again."
3,"We had a very mixed group here with lots of tastes.  All the usual Chinese buffet items were in this vast palace, plus Mongolian BBQ and steak/chop grill, a sushi table, taco bar and lots of desserts.  I can't remeber if spagetti was on one table, but I'm thinking it was.  I didn't roam the steam tables much, loaded up a Mongolian BBQ plate, returning to dine, later than anyone, with our group.  People in general were happy, one or two got a more hot chiles than expected.  Some went back for thirds.   \n\nIt was very good, and may be the only Chinese food place we could take my mother-in-law and she could find food she'd eat."
0,"We flew to Phoenix for spring training, our flight arrived in the morning and we ended missing most of the game because of Hertz. We waited almost 2 hours in line.. \n\nThey have these kiosks where people from a call center help you over the phone, which is great, although the manager stopped working them so no one was using them. I picked up his job and started calling customers over to the kiosks as reps were answering. \n\nThere were 3 people working, then two went on break with at least 45 people in line. When I was finally 6th in line, it took an additional 40 minutes. \n\nWhen we finally got our vehicle, we waited another 30 minutes to get out of the parking lot, because again, only two people were working. \n\nWhen I returned the car, I had fee upon fee upon fee. I booked a vehicle for 3 days for $32/day through hot wire. I ended up paying $490. They said I chose a $30/day optional insurance.. I would never. I got one fee reversed because they messed up, saying we were an underage driver, but the other one the rep over the phone said I had to contact the Phoenix branch. I have called this branch 7 TIMES. 7. I have left a message every time and I have never received a call back.\n\nI will never rent from Hertz again. Their customer service sucks and they rip you off."
0,"Since the change of ownership, the food is only OK.  So it wasn't ever on my go to list for pho, but after a long day and returning from a biz trip... this is the closest pho joint to my home.\n\nThe owner (I assume based on previous experience) sat me down w/ a menu.. and there I sat.. sat ... sat.. and finally the owner goes out w/ a buddy to drink a beer and has to walk by me.. as I continued to sit (first table by the entrance).  At the 10min mark, I gave up and returned the menu to the bar area.  As I walked outside, the owner was like \""Are you done already?\"".  Obviously not, you sat me 10 min ago.. so I found that question pretty condescending.  I told him I didn't receive any service after 10 min, and to his credit, he apologized.\n\nSo 2 stars for the ho-hum food, 1 star overall for poor service = erasing knowledge of the existance of this restaurant.  FAIL.\n\nORIGINAL 10/28/2010 (4 star):\nI come here occasionally, which means the food is tasty enough.  My personal consensus is the pricing is higher than what I'd generally pay to get a no-soup vermicelli fix (their bowls are huge, yum #20)... This place is good for taking newbies (the atmosphere and decor is modern and inviting) and folks who are judgemental about divey looking joints."
2,"Typisches Ibis hotel, mit sehr funktionaler Einrichtung. Systembad, das an einen Wohnwagen erinnert, aber es ist alles da, was man ben\u00f6tigt. Leider kein freies WLan auf den Zimmern. Zimmerservice ist ok, das Personal am Empfang freundlich. \u00dcber das Restaurant kann ich leider nichts sagen, da ich keine Mahlzeiten dort eingenommen habe. Parken kann man neben dem Hotel auf einem eigenen Parkplatz f\u00fcr EUR 8.00 am Tag. Insgesamt keine negativen aber auch keine positiven \u00dcberraschungen."
1,"Aside from the water being spilled on my coworker, the food was ok. Nothing spectacular really. Eh, they could have at least comped their food for spilling those glasses on them."
3,"Our last several hours spent in Vegas were dedicated to visiting Margaritaville for both a good meal and drinks. We were also expecting to be able to get our hands on the tall, long margarita cups that we assumed were sold here, but we were disappointed to find out that we were at the wrong place for this. Nonetheless, it did not prevent us from having our final meal in Vegas.\n\nUpon arrival, we noticed a handful of people waiting to be seated and hoped that it wouldn't be a long wait as our flight departed in a couple hours. Luckily, from the time we requested a table to actually being seated, it was no more than 15 minutes. Our server assisted us within 5 minutes of being seated and took our drink orders. There were a variety of drinks to choose from; I ordered the Big Rita on the rocks and also was interested in the Mango Frozen margarita. Both were excellent and brought to us 5 minutes after ordering them. We didn't order appetizers but it was really amazing seeing what the Volcano nachos looked like at the table next to ours. One word describes them: humongous! As for our food, we ordered burgers, quesadillas, and a chicken burger, all of which came with fries. The food was much better than expected and delicious. The burger was full of flavor and went perfectly with my drink. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the portions were generous and the overall quality excellent.  The prices are reasonable with the drinks always being expensive as with the rest of Vegas."
3,"I like Target for a number of reasons, but mostly for the lack of long lines. If they had a Super Target closer to my home, and the prices were slightly more competitive with Walmart, I'd forget all about shopping at Walmart at all."
1,"I'm not being stingy with my stars, but I guess I was simply disappointed.  Last night was my 2nd visit, and I don't recall the food being so sub-par from my 1st visit (which was a little while back shortly after they opened).\n\nOur reservation was at 8:30 and we got seated quite on time.  We decided to sit outside.  Inside was a bit loud, I couldn't hear a darn thing the host was asking me.  Quick observation, that is not a drink friendly bar area.  Most people at the bar actually eat, and some stools are permanently fixed to the ground.  I thought it would be a little rude to squeeze in between the cutesy couple who somehow managed to PDA and eat at the same time... as much as I was dying for a drink after a \""fun\"" day at work.  \n\nWe sat by the fountain, which was nice (except it may cause an increased need to use the bathroom).  The waiter was attentive (as in he frequently stopped by to check on us) but something was missing... that certain energy, the bounce, something.  But overall service was good.  \n\nHere comes the food review.  Ok... food is very important for a restaurant, just my opinion.  We had the summer roll for appetizer (figured we should stick to something light).  I'm accustom to the summer rolls at vietnamese places, so this one here is a bit... empty/lacking.  There's a shrimp in each one, and supposedly mango (I saw it but couldn't taste it), but that's about it.  The dipping sauce was more sour than peanut-y.  To me this is an example of \""if it ain't broken, don't fix it.\""  Stick with the original summer roll recipe (with noodles and a thin slice of pork and bean sprouts etc), it's ok to be not original if it's better that way.\n\nFor entree I decided to try something different and ordered a Burgushi (Tuna Bacon Sandwich).  My friend ordered the Taste Explosion (another Burgushi recommended by 2 friends of mine actually).  I was intrigued by the description of the buns being made of rice.  Yes, I'm easily amused.  One word to sum up both dishes: Bland.  Mine was definitely tasteless... I asked for more wasabi mayo to help out.  I think the problem is the tuna is too thin and not seasoned. The iceberg lettace washes out any other taste there is to taste.  The buns were interesting, but they could season it a little as well.  The Taste Explosion was better, but the ground beef taste was too strong and overwhelmed everything else.  \n\nTo conclude, I have eaten my share of sushi and other original culinary creations... and I'm definitely one to explore new/odd/interesting food, but I was expecting more from a place everyone raves about.  The food was simply too blahhh to get any more stars :(   But Wednesday half-price wine bottle saved the night, along with some interesting conversations :)  And oh, please put avocado crab sticks back on the menu... that was one good thing I remember having from 1st visit."
4,"Mandalay Bay is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I love it because they have my favorite room - the two bedroom X3 suite. I typically have a lot of girls in my group and that means we need more than one bathroom. The X3 has a king bed in one bedroom and two queen beds in another. Each large bedroom has a huge bedroom with two sinks. That's 4 sinks in the joint. This suite accommodates 6 girls very comfortably. Last trip, we had 8 ladies in the group so I booked the GR suite next door and it was a perfect for us to have the entire corner of the floor. \n\nI also love the pool area. I prefer a bungalow or a cabana, but the regular areas are great too. \n\nI used to live in Las Vegas and have a lot of friends that still live there. Mandalay Bay is conveniently located at the end of the strip by the airport and Town Square. My friends can easily pick me up without battling the entire length of the strip. \n\nI wish they had some nightlife. When is Rum Jungle going to be redone?"
4,"There were many things on fire, but don't let that or the strip mall entrance dissuade you. The food was very well done all around, and the wine choices were inspired, even at the lower price points."
1,"First time at this theater this evening August 20, 2014. Can't say there will be a second. \n\nWe saw the Ninja Turtle movie. \n\nLet's start with the positives. Clean bathroom. Clean theater with decent seats. That's it. \n\nWe bought our tickets online. When I got to the counter to pick them up I asked if my south point card was needed. I didn't know if they reward you for setting movies there-but was hoping. I was looked at like I was stupid and the girl said \""I don't know.\"" Not even \""let me find out.\"" Ugh\n\nThen there was some event going on with a meet and greet. We had no idea where to go or what to do. The concession stand is very confusing and the meet and greet area was blocking the area to our theater hallway. Finally I found a clerk and was told to go over to the other side of the concession stand. But then had to walk through all of the meet and greet people again. When we got our popcorn and drinks the girl scooping the popcorn was kind of rude. \n\nNo refills? No thanks. That right there means we won't be back. I bought a large pop but there was so much salt on the popcorn that my son and I downed the $5 pop before the movie started. I've never been to a theater that doesn't offer refills - even if you have to PAY a small fee for the refill."
1,"Sister and I were hungry at 10 PM on a Sunday night and were looking for some Mexican delight. Pepe's Tacos had recently opened up near our house and we decided to get down.\n\nI ordered three tacos: carne asada, lengua, and al pastor. The lengua and the carne asada were decent. Not horrible, but not stand out. The star of my taco trio was the al pastor. The marinated pork, cilantro, onion, a squeeze of lime, a touch of the hot sauce. AMAZING! Definitely a must try. \n\nMy sister got the Machacha Plate which came with beans, rice, and warm tortillas. The machacha itself was pretty bland, nothing really lively or exciting about it. Didn't really pack much of a punch. The rice and beans were okay as well.\n\nPepe's is open 24 hours and has a wide variety of offerings that are all cooked to order. They have a traditional taco salsa bar, with the red hot spicy sauce of death (which I love) and a green, mild salsa. The carrot, onion, jalapeno mix. Radishes. \n\nThis location was clean, brightly lit. The staff was friendly. Pepe's is a decent taco shop. A step up from Roberto's, but not a home run."
0,Beyond disappointing....Wannabe Heaven...Overpriced ... Bunch of kids running the place... I wonder what it will be called next year after this one fails....
4,"I LOVE Bloom Salon... all of their stylist are very qualified and provide excellent hair care...I prefer to book my appointments with Andrea, but if she is not available I am not afraid to book with anyone else.  Not only does this salon provide hair care, but they also offer skin, nails and massage therapy!!  What a great place with a relaxing atmosphere...I HIGHLY recommend this place."
4,"This was my first Cici's experience - and for the record, I loved it!\n\nFor $5, you get all-you-can-eat pizza, soup, salad, and dessert.  The quality isn't top-notch, but everything still tasted great, there was an excellent variety of pizzas (they even make them made-to-order), and the service was outstanding.  I would absolutely return!"
2,"I've been twice and I like it but I haven't been amped enough to give it 4 stars quite yet. It takes some instruction the first time you go...you order off a tablet. It's not cosmic but can be a little cumbersome and time consuming. However, if you are the type to order a specific item then change everything on it and put half of it on-the-side then you will love it. Most annoying to my wife is that when you order a drink, you don't get that drink until your food comes (we always go harass them before that though). \n\nThe food is good and ingredients are fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was a good price at $5. Then I got the Mediterranean Turkey and it was $9, plus $1 since I wanted cheese :(     Not heinous but a slightly expensive sandwich.\n\nNice worker bees. They don't really do a whole lot besides deliver your food so I'm not a huge tipper here. Too bad for them."
4,"There is nothing better than a neighborhood market, and Frick Park Market fits the bill. Come here for grocery staples, a great homemade sandwich (get the breakfast sandwich, any of them!), or just to hang out. The owner will be there & is happy to talk to you.\n\nThe best part about the market, though, is when the kids get off school & come into the store for candy & soda. You can tell that the business is connected to the neighborhood and that everyone gets along. Pittsburgh treasure!"
3,"So, I found this bagel place because its in the same shopping strip as my 'new' Fry's grocery store.\n\nI went in, and it was pretty good.  They have a nice variety of fresh bagels, sandwiches, and a nice menu selection of items to choose from.  I went with a bagel, and asked if they had lox cream cheese.  He said that he would make it fresh for me on request!  wooohoo!\n\nI really like this place better then Einstiens, and the guys there seem to be friendly and cool.   Great place to grab a bagel and a coffee on a Saturday or Sunday Morning!\n\nPS.  This is my 100th review!  go me!"
2,"Le Mont  isn't the type of place I'd ever choose to go to myself seeing it's fairly expensive and a place where I'd have to cross my legs, sit up straight, and use the right forks- that and the decor reminds me of a dilapidated mansion. But after a delicious pomegranate martini I couldn't care less what kind of restaurant I was in, the cliche view was great and the food to follow even better. Not really \""different\"" enough for my taste... just another fancy restaurant but the service was great and I'd recommend it to someone trying to impress a date."
3,"These people are awesome.\nTip - if you're a GOLD member, go downstairs.  You'll wait upstairs for an hour!!!\nClean cars ready to go!"
3,"I'm giving them a star bump because the last time I went the service was a lot more attentive for the afternoon tea. They even didn't charge us the upcharge for sharing pots of tea! This may have been an oversight but I didn't mind not paying extra to try the different teas.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the most busy place, and I'm curious to see if they stay in business for long since both times I went I was close to the only party in the restaurant. We'll see, and I wish them the best!"
3,"About 50+ of my friends and I visited this place last Monday night (yes we gave them a heads-up we'd be coming)... like a bunch of locust we stormed this place for about an hour of drinking and socializing before hitting the road. Walking in, this place isn't the biggest, but I was surprised to find a very good size patio out back with a ping-pong table. They have a pool table too and although it's really just a bar, if you need a snack while there, they have some bar food options (basically anything that'll fit in a microwave behind the bar). The owners were very friendly and the waitress working the bar did a great job handling the crowd. I give them 2-thumbs up. Great little neighborhood hang out."
4,"How could I forget to write a review about this place!?\n\nMe and my teammate stopped in for \""tapas style brunch\"" after a tournament.  For a few extra bucks, brunch came with bottomless mimosas.  Now, I ate here earlier this summer, so I don't remember EXACTLY what we had, but all I can remember was how awesome everything tasted and next time I'm at Mandalay Bay on a weekend, we WILL return for brunch.\n\nFood: 5 stars man, it really was delicious.  Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.\n\nThere were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.\n\nService: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.  We left her a bomb ass tip.\n\nAtmosphere: We ate on the outdoor patio, overlooking the hotel pool.  The sun was shining in, the air was fresh.  Loved it.  \n\nMaybe it was Vegas, maybe it was the drinks, but either way I was quite wooed by the whole experience."
2,"It's a must see if you are visiting the west rim. But yes, it is a rip off. It's $80 to visit the site and walk on the skywalk. What makes this a really bad deal is the idea that you cannot even bring a camera/phone on the skywalk. The excuse that you might drop it in the canyon or on the glass is just another way for them to justify making money off of you by taking pictures for you and selling them to you. Seriously, why would anyone throw their couple hundred dollars phones/cameras away? The walk is a one time visit and will not get a second visit from me, for sure. However, if you've never seen it, you should go take a look."
0,"Found their rental ad on a zillow or trulia and received a call back from Keenan Gerson and set-up an appointment to see a house later that day.  We arrived on-time but Mr. Gerson was 15 minutes late.  Looked at the house and liked it but was very vague on answers.  He told us to just apply online.  So, I tried to do that but was not able to complete the application process after many failed attempts.  The next day I called their office and a lady answered and said that Mr. Gerson was in, then she came back on the line and told me he was not and wanted me to leave a message.  I did leave a message and never received a call back since.  Good thing because I found an awesome property elsewhere with great people showing the house.  \nAlso, its about $35-$40 application fee for each person going to live at the house, non-refundable.  Just a heads up to all who are out there looking to use their services."
4,"Can I just say that I miss the Chai lattes here???  Mo-fo's is the only place I know of that uses ACTUAL tea to make these, and not that crappy syrup. I'm ruined for any other Chai experience...RUINED. Someone find me a respectable chai on the west side, please!"
3,Preshow meal turned into an unexpected gem. Location with a view of the Bellagio fountains and a super friendly staff. Just wish the preshow menu wasn't so constricted.
0,"Came here last night & had the worst experience ever! I ordered the bbq wings & fat fries. When my food came out, my wings looked burnt. I ate one and they were horrible. I sent them back & continued to eat my fries. When finished, I noticed my left upper lip had swollen. I asked for a manager and he didn't seem concerned at all but I did feel out a report. I will never go back to this place. I'm not allergic to any foods so I knew it had to be this place. So enter at your own risk!"
1,Music is great!!   Service a bit lacking    Items don't match what's written in the menu.  Daughter ordered popcorn shrimp but they served 3 big butterflied shrimp instead \nI ordered meat ravioli but got some pesto mish mosh instead     Decent but not traditional meat ravioli.  \nWould come back just to have dinner on the patio with live music
3,Staff is friendly. Smoothies are a little sugary for my taste. Coffee is great.
0,"Went on a late Tuesday afternoon. I can't imagine what this place looks like on a weekend.\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to make one side for small dogs, and the other for larger dogs? If there was a scuffle, it wouldn't be a possible death sentence? Or if the larger dogs do run a little bit, my dog wouldn't get trampled and possibly break its leg? That is my one major complaint.  If you are on the passive side, why would you bring a ball and thrower, and have a 150 pound dog. That worries me a little and doesn't really suggest a passive dog. One bad jump, or one bite, and my dog is dead or seriously injured. \n\nAlso, why are the people so.... rude and unwelcoming? I felt like I was in grade school getting picked last for kickball. No, i am not from Scottsdale. I didn't bring Poopsie or a gigantic shiz wagon that drags me along by it's leash. I'm the new girl...oooooh.\nI literally had one lady come up to me, stare, then say \""Are those dogs with you?\"" I say yes, she stares some more and then walks away. ???\nI just stood there feeling like an a-hole.\nIf I seen some girl come walking in with cute little dogs I would at least come up and BE FRIENDLY.\n\nYes it's large and somewhat clean, especially considering the sheer numbers of dogs there (some 4 to 1 person).  If you like crowds, then this is for you. I'm just not into being treated like a leper. Being around 25 dogs, and 12 snotty people that don't pay attention and use it as their social hour. The only thing this place is missing is a martini bar."
1,"A bit overpriced ($90 / $85 with the Total Rewards card); and not a good return on that money.  We were here on 09/28/14 Sunday with a 12pm reservation.\n\nFirst of all, if you still decide to go, make your reservations for the earlier times (9:30am to 12pm), as they do tend to run out of the better things after 12pm.  You can sign up for the free Total Reward card at the Bally's hotel, where the buffet is at; located at the same BLT Steak restaurant; which turns into the steakhouse in the evenings.\n\nThe Pros:\nAYCE lobster, lamb chops, caviar, champagne, & king crab legs, and they give you a Popover at the beginning of the meal (but they ran out of them at around 1:30pm)\n\nThe Cons:\nThe lobster was a bit tough; and after around 1pm, instead of a whole lobster tail, they started putting out a half tail.  When we arrived at 12pm, we heard they had run out of oysters already.  The filet Mignon was just a small piece of meat in a small pan, not very tasty, actually kind of bland.  The nigiri sushi didn't look fresh; Genki sushi tasted better.  Lobster bisque (which you have to order from the waiter) was bland.  The service was also lacking; as our waiter catered to a certain table of 6, and pretty much ignored us.\n\nOverall; it's a quantity over quality.  We came for the AYCE lobster , filet Mignon, and crab, and the pictures here did look great.  But it was a disappointment.  For your money, find another buffet.  :("
3,"Open for about three months, I didn't even know about Juan's until I saw Misti's review and then my gal pals suggested it for dinner because it was close to Sweet Addiction--hah!  See how I pick my friends?  Always thinking about the sugar!  Anyway, we had a solid meal here, going with the flaming fajitas, of course.  I got chicken and my pals shared a chicken and steak combo for two.  Both courses came out in a timely manner, with the flaming presentation for each, literally.  It's cool to see your food on fire.  I enjoyed my chicken fajitas and my pals rated the chicken better than the steak, too.  The chips and salsa were nothing special.  Service is attentive and friendly and the rest of the menu is quite extensive, but for my first visit I had to have the fajitas and not bad at all for $13.95.  I'll come back to try something different next time--nice to have an option for Mexican cuisine on this side of town, near Sweet Addiction AND Perfect Scoop ;)."
0,"Extremely poor customer service. Received a phone call from them stating my balance was being sent to collections. After reviewing my financial records, I am not disputing the amount owed. I had credit card fraud a few months back. The account was set to auto pay each month. After getting a new card, I did not set up my auto pay again. Totally my bad. However, I was not contacted once by the gym or the company they outsource their receivables to.  I then suddenly get a call saying my balance has been sent to collections. \n\nI went to the gym to speak to a manager. The front desk person asks me to take a seat, it might be a while.  She made no attempt to call a manager over. I then walked up to another staff member, the training manager, to explain my situation.  She gives me conflicting information - first she says we tried to call you but then states that a 3rd party handles their collections so they would be the ones to call.  Which one is it?? \n\nI then get passed off to a membership manager. Same contradictory garbage.  Then she finishes with \""well what do you want me to do about it\"".  At least some semblance of effort would have been nice to reach out to the collection agency and perhaps ask if I could just settle my payment at the gym right away.  \n\nOn my way out, I am given a collection agency phone number.  I call the number and it is a non working phone number!!  So I called the gym back to let them know and they state it is the only number that they had.  They tell me I should go on the Golds Gym website to find the number. The only problem with that is that the gym is franchise owned, not corporate owned. So the only people who know what collection agency they use is the local gym.   After being placed on hold for several minutes, they are able to tell me the name of the collection agency they use and suggest I google it to find the number.  \n\nI'll be researching debt collection laws as I have a pretty good hunch they cant send you to collections without first contacting you.  If I'm right I will definitely be filing a complaint with BBB, the FTC and whomever else I can."
2,I am giving James Street Speakeasy two additional stars.  One of the owners Adam took the time to comment on my review and I appreciate that kind of involvement.\n\nHell maybe I will try back just not on a Sunday if I want steak!
3,Innovative southwestern cooking. Small plates can make a meal. The duck confit relleno is to die for. Truly a first class wine list.
4,"Home to good microbrew tap specials, the Hometown Sweethearts, and my upcoming new favorites, Brown Derby!  I find it both fun and relaxing to sit inside and have a nice, cold beer with good company and good tunes going on.  They have a good jukebox if there's no live music.\n\nOccasionally, the service leaves something to be desired, but I just pave over that feeling with more beer.  ;)"
0,"Horrible experience.  The cashiers looked like they were miserable, which made me miserable.  When we told them that we ordered an iced coffee rather than a hot one, she just dumped the drink in the trash and proceeded to make a new one without saying a word.  HORRIBLE!"
2,"If I'm ever up for a grease-laden meal, I know where to go. The carnitas was probably my favorite item from my combo meal. Meat was tender and juicy. Jade red chicken reminded me of Panda Express Orange Chicken just with a different sauce. Fried rice seemed a bit dry. Refried black beans had a nice spicy kick to them."
2,"I was expecting more of a bakery, but it is primarily a coffee shop that serves a small selection of baked goods and sandwiches.  We ordered a pair of blueberry muffins, a coffee and a chocolate chip cookie.  The muffins were nothing special, the coffee was good and they initially forgot to serve me the cookie.  I ended up with both my original cookie plus a second one as an apology.  The cookies were mediocre and very much overpriced unless you get a 2nd one free.  LOL\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience but not one I expect to experience again.\n\nA rating of 2.5 would be more appropriate."
3,"I loved this place and I would of gave them 5 stars if the menu had a little description of some of their more traditional foods. My fiance ordered the hot-stone bowl and I had their teriyaki beef and rice.\n\nThey start you off with about 6 small plates of cucumber salad, and varies kinds of kimchi."
2,"I've been here several times and tried the chimichanga, street tacos, and the pollo fun dido. The chimi and tacos are just ok. A little flat in flavor. The fun dido is real tasty with a good kick and a lot of cheese. Their complimentary chips n salsa are delicious and they give you a variety with flour and corn chips!  The margarita is very good but a little light In the tequila zone. I'd like to give them a 4 star if it wasn't for the rather inflated prices, but I suppose they're in the right area for it in n. Scottsdale. I will be back but will most likely get a beer instead of the cocktail."
1,"The delivery was super quick but the pizza was just okay.  Nothing special about it at all, but they do offer delivery later than most places in town."
0,Terrible customer service. I'm never going back there. My co-worker & I went there for lunch because we had a coupon. It was a buy one get one coupon. We repeatedly asked the waitress if we could use it & about what we could order. She assured us that we could use it. When it came time for the checks we were informed that we couldn't use the coupon because one of us got the special. There wasn't anything stated on the coupon saying that we couldn't do that. We decided to let that slide b/c they were going to still take half of one of our meals. Then they came back AGAIN & said they couldn't accept the coupon at all. In the end we had to both pay full price. They were extremely rude & not helpful. I guess they don't want us to come back. They obviously don't care about their customers. Plus the sushi wasn't all that great & we had to wait forever.
0,"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \n\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
4,"If you are considering attending the University of Wisconsin as an option for college, you MUST visit the Rathskeller to see what's up.  I remember coming here 10 years ago when I was on my college tour and this place sealed the deal.  It's unlike any other student union on any other campus I've seen.  When you walk in, you feel both instantly cozy and but somehow have plenty of room.  The whole place is all dark wood and murals and arcs of doorways and German decorating.  The cafeteria also makes awesome sandwiches and gigantic chocolate chip cookies.  There's nothing like looking out the window on a snowy day overlooking the lake as you sip cocoa or heading down for a couple beers on open mic night.  This place is one of my favorite places on earth.  You will love it."
2,"I have an extreme love-hate relationship with this place.  It is the epitome of Scottsdale douchery: drunk artards, stumbling floozies, college kids, v-neck T's that are too small, skirts that are too short, bitchy service, poles to dance on, lines for the bathroom, disgustingly trashed bathrooms etc. But alas I have trolled into Firehouse at the wee hours of the night and danced my booty off and had a blast...I probably qualified as one of those idiots I spoke of above.  I have met one cool bartender.  The drinks usually have a relatively heavy pour.  The music is generally always pumping groovy tunes that you can't help but move to.  I can't speak to the food, but I do know they serve food late night.  I have been here during the day a few times and it was pretty dead, but the people I met were very cool and definitely deep into some day drinking.  I really can't complain all that much, in general it is a good time, if you can get past the annoyances...a few drinks helps with this ;)"
2,"Food was fantastic! It was SO loud I felt like i was screaming during dinner...didn't completely ruin it but I am undecided if I would go back. Keeping in mind, it was 7:30pm, not 10:00pm. A bit disappointing."
0,"For the privilege of sitting next to the kitchen I was treated to a mediocre meal that balanced lukewarm French toast with overcooked eggs. I would have mentioned it to my server, but I feared the sweat dripping from his brow would land in my plate had he stood still long enough to actually listen to me. The entire restaurant is in need of a good scrubbing (think walls and table sides/edges) so that patrons are not forced to share space with the remnants of past meals. Overall, thumbs down."
0,"We visited the restaurant on my birthday. We were terribly disappointed. We ordered pizza and pasta and an appetizer. The food was alright not the same standards as years ago. The service of the staff was horrendous! We had to get our own drinks, look for our own napkins and they were demeaning. My 7 year old had the kids meal which included an ice cream scoop. They just came and said they ran out of dessert. No apologies, I will not return. They are sending me email to nominate them to have the best pizza? There are many more places out there with better pizza."
4,"AMAZING. It is tradition for me to visit this fantastic restaurant each time I visit Las Vegas. The kobe beef burgers are FLAWLESS, as is the yellowtail sashimi. The desert platters are UNBELIEVABLE. I honestly have no complaints."
0,"Once was enough.  This buffet ranks very near the bottom of the list of those I've eaten at.  I think the buffet scene in \""Vegas Vacation\"" with Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid must have been filmed here.\n\nCan't recommend it to anybody for any reason."
0,"So.....I knew not to expect much based on the area, but I figured I'd give it a chance. The room was fairly clean except there was a hair and some weird stain on the bed....lets organize this post a bit because there were a number of issues.\n\n1. Stain and hair on the bed...not a huge deal.\n2. When they came to clean, they didn't change the sheets.\n3. We were woken up by the gardeners on Saturday morning at 9am with the leaf blower.\n4. The maids were in the hall talking very loudly at 9am as well.\n5. As we left, the maids watched us the whole time as they \""kicked it\"" at the stair well. We felt so unwelcomed. \n\nI will never stay here again."
3,"It's been over a year since I was here and promised to leave a review. Why wait that long?  \n\nOne benefit is that I can say that the work done has stood the test of time and other than the title it would be hard for someone not very well versed in used cars to tell it was ever in an accident. \n\nThe process of working with LG was very good with  some phone tag, but not excessively so. There were complications from the kind of accident it was and insurance companies involvment that caused delays  plus the difficulty of getting parts from Japan at the time made it hard to get a handle on how long it would take for me to rent a car for.   In the end they helped me out on the deductible as their site says and a few days car rental so It was fair. \n\n I'd be more than happy to take a car back here should the need arise and I'm pretty sure you'll be  in the 4-5 star range when you do.    For me 4.5"
3,"I was so happy to find real food at the airport.  The service was friendly, my wine was delicious and reasonably priced- considering the location, and my food was good.  I didn't time the arrival of my food, but the place was fairly full and I still received it promptly.  I chose the open-faced chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and it was far more than I could eat."
1,"This casino is really outdated and in need of some major revamping.  It's quite a shame considering that the Radisson that's adjacent to the casino actually is a lovely place.  Considering the many other new and modern casinos that exist in the Phoenix metro area, this place doesn't really seem to be much of a destination except maybe for locals or people looking only to gamble and who don't care about overall ambiance.  I would opt for any other Phoenix area casino before coming to this place."
3,"The first impression was a good one.  The host led us to our table and I couldn't help but notice the murals of Aztec leaders and ancient designs painted on the walls.  The dining area has a warm and inviting feel.  Festive music can be heard but not too loud.  After being greeted by a waiter in traditional garb they immediately brought us their house chips which are light and crispy and they'll bring as many as you can eat.  \n\nThe salsa is watery, chunky, lacks any kick and I didn't find the pico de gallo appetizing either.  But the guacamole is made fresh table-side by a charming woman who doesn't speak much but smiles a lot.  You get to choose how spicy and whether you want onions, cilantro, lime, or all of the above.  She then muddles it in a stone serving dish and lets you taste-test it before she sets it on your table and moves on.\n\nThe ground beef tacos are too greasy.  But the flank steak in the Tacos al Carbon is sublime compared to the other items I've tried so far.  The menu is huge so there are still plenty of items to try on return visits.  For the value and down home atmosphere it's a great alternative to the other high (snooty) and low (scary) Mexican restaurants around town."
1,"Well it's been several years since we have eaten at this restaurant. Not since the rigatoni's people owned it. We used to enjoy this place quite a bit as the food was good, patio ambiance was nice, and the service is usually spot on.\n\nOnly one Sunday afternoon tried again with the new ownership and left a bit disappointed. As mentioned above, the Trinity of restaurant experience of ambiance, food and service are necessary for good experience; however, if one is missing, and drastically missing here, experience is just marred.\n\nWe took a seat on the patio and were not greeted for 15 min. yes 15 full minutes sitting alone like hobo Joes. I kind of felt like leaving and going next door to dos gringos. The server finally approached was far from enthusiastic seemed like almost annoyance to her to be waiting tables this afternoon. Almost zombielike, probably just hung over. In fact all the service staff that I viewed seem to have this zombielike hangover.\n\nAnyhow, I asked her about the bloody Mary's and they were good as I assume they should be a roadhouse and she said, \""the other awesome this bartender makes a really good.\"" I smiled and happily agreed and waited in anticipation for this bloody Mary of greatness. She left and we see her again for almost 15 min. which is absurd. When she did come back to the table she didn't have my drink she just wanted to take the food order simply said, \""you ready?\"" Not much the menu lead huh. She took our food order and didn't offer an appetizer before leaving so I had to call her back to order one. Still no bloody Mary.\n\nWhen the bloody Mary did arrive we have been seated for about 27 min. yes 27 min. to get a drink. What's more disappointing is how awful the drink was. I'm not particularly picky as I felt you can't really mess up a bloody Mary but they sure did. Came out in a small plastic tumbler glass and literally tasted like tomato juice with barely any spice in it and no garnish whatsoever. It looked really sad and tasted sad. What really pissed me off was about 15 feet away there was a couple of guys seating at the bar who have bloody Mary's in glass pint glasses with a salted rim and a bunch of garnishes with some celery stalk and you can see from the color of the drink that it was made like a bloody Mary. REALLY!! It really sucks and I totally felt cheated. Restaurants without consistency drive me crazy. A Big Mac in Boston is the same as a Big Mac in San Diego. Your drinks and food should be the same. \n\nThe food runner or cook came to our table with an appetizer of sliders and said, \""your sliders.\"" I told him that we an order that that we ordered shrimp and he said, \""what you mean?\"" I found that almost comical statement as it reiterated to him that we had ordered shrimp not sliders. About 5 min. later shrimp came out. This is where I have a hard time deciphering between two and three stars for this place because the food is really good. The Cajun shrimp drunken appetizer was outstanding. I even thought of ordering one to go for later on.\n\nI had a Rubin and my mom had meatloaf. My mom's diabetic and can have a lot of sugar and the meatloaf came out with huge blobs of barbecue sauce on it. I'm not sure that was my mistake and I didn't read the menu correctly but I don't think I would have missed that. Anyhow we scraped off the barbecue sauce and my mom absolutely love smoky flavored meatloaf she commented about three times how good it was. My Reuben sandwich also was very good with an ample stacking of meat which I appreciated. Coleslaw was obviously fresh and had a good flavor but lacked the will of the seasoning and punch. Again food was outstanding. No doubt about that.\n\nAfter the appetizer was served I had seen that they have Corona light on tap so I ordered one. 20 min. to get a beer and I was nearly finished with my meal when it came. This is stupid.\n\nThe only other negative was that the facility needs a bit of a facelift noticed was the same furniture from four or five years ago and it's starting to show.\n\nBottom line I probably won't go back because I can't deal with atrocious service."
0,"So I went there to buy the new Nook HD as a Christmas gift.I might as well have been buying a magazine for as much customer service I received. There was a display of all the Nooks, but nowhere did it say to go to register to buy it. The display, nice as it was, could not answer questions I had. This is not my first Nook purchase as it seems they come out with a new one each year, however I still had some questions. I went to the customer service counter and asked where I could find the Nooks to purchase. He curtly told me they were at the register (as if I was to have already known this). I went to the register and was helped ( well, I wouldn't really call it helped) by a woman whom I'd really like to name here, but won't. Her disinterest in my purchase was evident and I was guided in buying the wrong screen protector.  Again, this wasn't a cheap purchase, and I was the only one in line until an obvious off-duty employee came in and they exchanged their hellos. The gift was well-received, and with the gift receipt the recipient was able to exchange for the correct screen protector. This wasn't one employee giving bad customer service...this was 2. It's a no return store for me."
1,Not really sure what all the hype is about. We had the double trouble sundae - two scoops of ice cream and hot fudge for $7. Ice cream flavors were pretty bland. Had the peanut chip and brownie flavors. Honestly would not come back here. Go to sugar bowl or sprinkles for better dessert in the area - this place is pretty sub par.
2,"Pretty good burgers and chili cheese fries. Breakfast is ok for a drive-thru as well. \nThey need to clean their iced tea machine though, tastes dirty and burnt."
1,"I took my children in one morning because they wanted to visit their play-land.  They do have a awesome play- land for kids. I was disappointed when I had ordered some chicken nuggets during breakfast hours for my kids and their manager refused to make them.  I have worked for this company in the past and their policy is to make fried products all day.  When I questioned it the manager said \"" It's not our policy\"".  She had no name tag on of course, but was a heavy older women that was just plain rude.  This is a corporate store, there are several other McDonald's in the area that are more friendly."
4,"Super Yummy, fast and very friendly service. Large portions, enough that we took some home and the kiddos ate it for lunch. My sons french toast was even good leftover"
3,"We came here for breakfast before spending the morning at River Ranch.  They have a great patio that overlooks the pool -- in the morning it was cool and there weren't many people swimming, but I could see that in the afternoon it could get very noisy.  Our server was Dee and she was so nice and personable, and always came around to check on us.  \n\nThey had a lot of good options for breakfast.  I went with Chicken and Waffles, which was really two chicken tenders on top of two thick waffles.  I personally enjoyed the chicken tenders (they were seasoned well and not overdry) but I could see how purists would demand traditional fried chicken.  I was not a fan of the waffle and wanted something a little thinner with more crunch.  The chicken and waffles were accompanied by home fries and two eggs any way, which I got scrambled.  The homefries looked like they came from a frozen package, but they were crisp and had good flavor.  Their drinks come in cute little mason jars which I loved.  \n\nThis place was not bad considering we were staying on the property and the convenience to River Ranch was great.  We thought our service was superb.  Probably wouldn't venture all the way back here just for a meal since it was a tad pricey (being a resort restaurant) and while the portions and quality were good, we probably would opt for some of our other favorite breakfast joints instead."
3,"Fantastic food a little more authentic than a lot of places around here. Their enchilada sauce is amazing. The employees are very friendly. They could maybe use a little more filling in the enchiladas, for the price."
3,"Great Service, Great Burgers minus the fries :) oh and Animal Style, at a Great Price!!!  They take pride in their food and customer service and it shows."
4,"This place is not only inspiration for custom baby photo books, but the ultra sound room is soothing and lovely! Spacious room with large flat screen for viewing. Terry the owner does an amazing job at the sneak peeks. Pictures are instant as well as online uploads, makes for simple sharing with family and friends."
2,"Nourriture: c'etait bon, mais sans plus. La qualite est la, mais ca manque de raffinement. Le choix des plats est interessants, mais ils n'ont pas tous sur le menu.\n\nPrix: la raison des 3 etoiles , pas cher du tout. Par contre, on m'a charg\u00e9 plus qu'il fait. Pas de facture, il m'a dit 27$. En sortant j'ai fait le calcul et ca donnait moins que ca! \n\nService: moins 3 etoiles. Lent, voir tres tres lent, pas souriant, on a du courrir apres le serveur. Des qu'il y a beaucoup de monde, le service est nul. En plus, si tu commandes autres chose que le Thali, c'est encore plus long. On est reste 2h, si c'est pas plus.\n\nPour le prix, ca peut valoir la peine, mais ca depend de vos priorites."
2,"Went here for a conference/meeting. The hotel is at the center of the Charlotte business district. The location is perfect and there are lots of interesting restaurants to visit around the hotel. \n\nThe rooms are fairly modern. Nothing fancy, but quite OK. The bathrooms are a bit outdated. The beds are quite comfortable. The noisy from the hallways is ridiculous. On a Saturday night you can hear all the parties taking place. They really need to isolate the rooms better for the noise. There is even a sheet of paper in the rooms related to \""non-disturbance policy\"". Clearly the hotel is aware that they have a problem:-)\n\nThe staff is not very attentive. They seem indifferent to everything. The door man could not be bothered to pick up my luggage, .... Just not the kind of service you expect from a Marriott."
2,"My husband and I finally checked out this place after hearing about it only a couple weeks ago.  The idea of a cute storefront restaurant on Main Street intrigued us.  We went on a weeknight and found the place surprisingly full - there were only five (of about 15-20) tables available when we arrived.  However, we were quickly seated and provided with our requested drinks.\n\nWe had pork bellies and kale chips for our appetizers.  The pork bellies were divine.  The kale chips were a bit lacking in flair.  It was basically dry kale with paprika sprinkled on top.  Not much else.\n\nMy husband got the Local Dish burger and declared it good.  The fries he got on the side were great.  I ordered their chicken & peaches sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The coleslaw was fantastic and I could have eaten more than the serving they gave me.  The chicken sandwich was average - but I loved knowing I was probably eating peaches from just a few blocks away at the Peach Stand.  The chicken itself was a bit dry but was helped by the pesto, spinach and peaches that came on it.\n\nWhy did I not give it more than 3 stars?  Because a second visit will be required, with other foods tried, before I decide to bump it up to four stars.  The restaurant was charming enough (and prices decent enough) that we'll most likely go back again the future."
1,"As mentioned below - and being as close as they are to the Phoenix megalopolis - they need to supervise the range very carefully - but even so, and as experienced as I am, the scene makes me very uncomfortable.  It can be very intimidating and a real turnoff to someone who is relatively new."
1,We came in for lunch. It was not busy but it still took us 40 minutes from the time we walked in to get our food. Which was just eggs and easy stuff that's quick. Then she completely forgot to bring my toast. Because it took so long to get our food we had to rush and couldn't even attempt to enjoy the mediocre food.
3,"People here are extremely nice, which is the reason why I upped this an extra star. Poke here though is a bit mediocre. I do have a quick little theory though about the fact that this place wasn't as good as the other Poke I've been too here in Vegas, well the thing is, we came in here about 10 minutes before this place was about to close. But if you own a poke spot you're expected to have fresh fish all the way up to when you close, so I can't really use that too much of an excuse. Just like I said this place is great though, people that run this tiny poke spot are really really courteous, nice, and everything else that goes along those lines of words.\n\nWe ordered the usual stuff just more of it because we just came here right before we left back home to the bay. We came here to bring a bunch of poke because we don't have anything like that around the bay. Anyways we had the squid, ahi garlic, and pretty much all the other ahi flavors. I might come back here and give this place another shot just because how awesome the owners are here and my theory about coming to this place late might be right.\n\nOwners keep up the friendly service. Service really matters when coming to any place!"
0,"Sad clientele at this place.  Played a few slots and didn't stay too long, this place is a big dive.  I suppose it's worth it to see it since it's a historic casino but honestly, I wouldn't recommend even checking it out.  It's the sort of place that you probably don't want to be around come sundown.  There's plenty to do at Fremont St. Experience, just stick with there.  The El Cortez is not for the faint of heart!"
4,"A very friendly Temple not full of people in Black Hats, just a bunch of very wise ones that will take you as you are and more great Spiritual Moments to appreciate and share with the person sitting next to you.\nWe all need an amount of G-d choose your dose."
0,"This is certainly not a French restaurant. The waitress didn't even know what brioche is, not that they serve it here. The brioche here is just toast.  The Corn Beef Hash wash cubed beef not hash and not very good.  The cappuccino was mediocre. Sour dough waffles, gouffles, nothing special. I wanted a souffle and my wife wanted a brioche. Neither were available. French, absolutely not.  Tourist trap, yes.  Never again for us.\n\nThis is Vegas.  I don't care if the food is pricey as long as it's good.  Don't waist your time here."
1,"Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers \""oh that guy is mad at me\"", because he waited long time for his order. I just don't think it's professional."
2,The hotel is new and we had a 2 bed sky suite with strip view. the wkd we were there the hotel was very full bc EDC wkd so they were very busy. The pool area is ok however the restaurant is pretty legit
1,Good times.  Great for St. Patty's!!  Get in early to grab yourself a table and start collecting the celebratory plastic cups.
2,"Not bad.\nOne star: Impressive lay out. \nTwo stars: The clams were awesome. \nThree stars: Quick to pick up dirty dishes at the table. Hubby had the prime rib and he thought it was decent. \nOne star deducted because they were stingy with the cut of prime rib (I could almost see through his slice. Just saying)\nOne star deducted: THEIR \""CREME BRULEE\"" IS LIKE CREME BRULEE ON DOWNERS! Gross and disappointing! Do NOT be fooled. Ugh."
1,"It's been a few years since we ate here last.  In Lucille's defense - I am not a huge restaurant BBQ fan - I much prefer the delicacies that the sexy hubby chef produces in our backyard.  However - this is the restaurant my son picked so we went.\n\nThere are really no complaints about the food really - it was neither Ohmygoodness awesome or Boythatreallysucks nastiness.  Food was warm and tasted good - just not memorable to me.\n\nSons got a rack of babybacks, tri tip and brisket - they all enjoyed them.  Since I am going to have backyard bbq deliciousness tonight - Hubby and I both went for the NY Strip - they were delicious - just not mind blowing to me.  Our dinners came with corn on the cob - didn't enjoy the bruised parts all over it though.\n\nWhat annoyed me though is a couple of things that had nothing to do about the food (Maybe I was just in a bad mood)...\n\n1.) We made reservations and our party of six arrived about 15 minutes early - there were plenty of places for our party to sit and there was no other parties waiting - so why did we have to wait?  Once they finally got around to seating us they stuck us clear in the back - I just don't like the layout of the restaurant very much - the back rooms feel closed off from the rest of the restaurant and the small room we were in felt somewhat claustrophic and our party of six was crammed in like sardines - even though there were other places to put us.  I hate being squished!\n\n2.) We were seated right next to the table that had our server's sister and boyfriend.  Guess who got the amazing service we should have had.  Our service wasn't horrible - I just felt like an afterthought.  She wasn't rude - just was more interested in talking to her sister and her date instead of checking in our her other tables.  Like I said she wasn't rude - just did the bare minimum of service - we saw her when she took our drink order, when she served drinks then immediately took meal order, the delivery of our food and when it was time for the check.  She did ask once during the meal how everything was.  The rest of the time it seemed like she chatted with her sister and her date. \n\n3.)   Like I said - maybe I was just in a bad mood - but why oh why every time we have gone here - we get seated near the large parties with annoying little kids - I have been there, done that.  I never let my kids screech to their hearts content when they were little - and the five year old - running around their table and screaming - Grrrrr!   \n\nI am really not in the mood to go back anytime soon."
0,"Make them give you a truck with gas in it.  I got a truck with only a quarter tank left and got no credit for filling it so that I knew I had enough gas to do what I needed.   $86 of gas and all I got was \""If you overfill, it's your problem\""  Well, it's also going to be your problem because I will never be back and I will be posting reviews like this one anywhere I can find.  Wish there was a zero stars option."
1,"This popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings.\nLocated in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite.\nThe restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.\nWe ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.\nIn seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.\nViva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa."
3,"Jedd and crew were very helpful in getting a solid start to a great bass system.\nQuality product and any questions I had they were more than informative, after all, spending a couple grand on a stereo is quite a big step these days. You want to know you are getting quality.\nA word of advice to all who go here and are considering a large purchase. In house warranty,it's 50$ for piece of mind. Don't make a mistake by passing on it, you never know. Just look at the guy above..perfect example"
3,Hog roast goodness. \nNice stuffing.\nNice apple sauce.\nReasonably priced.\nTotal win!
2,"3.5 stars\n\nI've tried 2 restaurants at MGM Grand: Craftsteak & Seablue.  I would rather come back to Craftsteak.\n\nCame here for my sister's 21st birthday dinner, there were 8 of us.  We ordered many dishes to share as family style dining which included: Halibut, Dayboat Scallops, Prime Angus Flat Iron, and Prime Bone-In New York Strip.  Our dishes were served with: Chickpea and Lentil Rice, Jumbo Asparagus, Olive Oil Smashed Potatoes, and Medley of Mushrooms. Everything was \""okay\"", the only dish that stands out that I would definitely order again is the Scallop - it was delicious.  Other than that, I don't think it's worth the money for average tasting food.\n\nOh, and they definitely need to redecorate this restaurant - please."
0,Crap.  Crap.  Crap.\n\nWent here figuring out that rooms don't matter too much.  It was cheap.  I'll give it that.  But that's all it's got going for it.  Some random false alarm at 2 am doesn't help its case either.
3,I've stopped in here a few times on my way to do groceries in the mid-morning and the staff is always friendly and smiling. I haven't been to sample their lunch or dinner options but I have had the pleasure of enjoying a few of their baked goods and have not been displeased. \n\nI love the concept and can't wait to stop by one evening and enjoy a game or two with the kids!
0,"Ordered oysters which were very fresh. The veal chop was horribly cooked - medium throughout but completely rare towards the bone (indicates it was frozen prior to cooked). Also got the neptune platter which had an assortment of apps - it was horrible, scallops dry, tataki was dry without taste, shrimp was cooked on the outside but not the inside. This was very disappointing.\nService was horrible and waiter was very argumentative when we brought to his attention the veal chop and in fresh seafood. \nThis place is a big no. I would not recommend going to this place unless you plan to get sick from eating the horrible seafood."
4,Awesome! We're from la and this was a treat! Chicken del sol was awesome!  Go here there's something healthy and delecious for everyone!
4,"I went here for the first time on Friday night. Now, I do not drink beer, I hate beer BUT all of my friends drink it so I goto breweries for support. I was impressed with NMBC, the interior was awesome, I loved seeing the stills and the whole rear wall is doors that open to a patio that were open. Our waiter was kick ass and was the epitome of customer service. There was some great live music going on and it wasn't some horrible hipsters.\nNow, as I said, I do not drink beer so I had a coke. It took me awhile to read the menu to decide what to eat, everyone raved about the crab dip and said the chicken sandwich and burgers were not worth eating. I decoded to get the all-meat 7\"" pizza and damnit, that was a FANTASTIC choice. Though I do not drink beer, I will come back for the atmosphere and the pizza. I gave 5 stars for the pizza."
3,"Went here last night and I was pleasantly surprised by the service and the food.  We started off with the zucchini fries and pretzels with different sauces.  The honey mustard sauce with the pretzels and the 'boom boom' sauce with the zucchini fries were my favorite.  I wasn't very hungry, so just got the grilled Buffalo salad, which was very good; love the dressing.  Everyone's meals looked great. Wish I wasn't full going there or I would have stolen from their plates.  I would like to try the pimiento cheese appetizer next time.\n\nThe dirty martini was perfect and the Leroy's lemonade was great - love any drink that comes in a mason jar.  The atmosphere was very loud and there were a lot of kids there, so this will be a family night out type of restaurant going forward, vs. dinner with friends/sans kids.  Our waitress was fantastic - knowledgeable about everything on the menu, friendly and very accommodating.   Will definitely be one of our go to restaurants when we go out with the kids."
2,"On my way home, I was looking for some quick eats and found this place via Yelp (of course). Any time I'm at a Vietnamese restaurant, I feel compelled to try their pho. I ordered a medium bowl of their basic beef pho. I was disappointed to see they don't serve tripe. However, the bowl was surprisingly large for only $6.50. I'd say the broth was tasty, but I'm not one to get into the complexities of broth ingredients. I also take off points whenever a place only has Sriracha and none of that \""home made\"" style chili sauce. This isn't really a big deal. I just prefer the chunky chili sauce.\n\nAnyway, for the price, this place is definitely A-OK. The service was a tad slow (it seemed like they didn't really have anyone working out in the customer area). Despite that, it's a decent place on the west side of town. Incidentally, I hear their other dishes are very good."
0,what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
2,"From out of town and needing food quickly, two tables with little plastic stools, a cooler full of drinks and a chipper lady taking orders at the counter, we were cautious but it turned out great.  Cucumber Salad spicy and fishy just like in thailand, pad thai/ fried rice and eggplant something all tasty and spiced to level three.  Portions huge, still warming it up for breakfast 3 days later. Steamed dumplings  delish, roti cannai appetiser more than a meal, not the best ever but good.  tons of food and drink for three peeps $48.00"
1,"Oh Dickens... You can't utter the name of the place without shaking your head.\n\nIt looks exactly how you would imagine it on the inside. The only surprising thing is the locals. No shouting, no balling, everyone was strangely quiet (on a Saturday afternoon!!). The staff looked like they were going to slip into a coma at any point, totally disinterested at the world.\n\nNot bar of the year, but I doubt they care."
1,"Have always enjoyed the Mediterranean food and very quick service here. However, the past two times my boyfriend and I have been to Aladdin's it has been bad news!\n\nSeveral months ago we were eating dessert and in the middle of the German chocolate cake we were sharing, we found a big green spot of mold!  So this means that the cake was old and/or stored at an incorrect temperature... gross either way.  The manager took the dessert off our bill and that was it.. no offer to discount the check, etc.  Think about it, we ate half of a piece of moldy cake that you served us.. not charging us for the cake is a  NO BRAINER.. but what are you going to do as a way of making this better? They did nothing and I don't like to make a scene so I let it go.\n\nA couple nights ago, recovered from the mold incident, we tried Aladdin's again.    But, my Kibbie was ice cold in the middle and had to be sent back.  It disrupted our meal and was an overall bad time.  Again,  no apology or offer to make it better.  \n\nI think management needs some retraining on how to make someone's bad experience OK again.  We have learned our lesson this time and won't be back; which is a shame because we used to really love it there."
1,I've been there only once but the place is actually pretty small and the crowd is pretty young (around 18-20). \n\nThe entrance fee seems rather high for the place.
4,"Delicious!  Had the Camarones del golfo,  delicious creamy sauce, large prawns, chorizo, too die for.  Tamarind margarita,  nice and tangy.  I'm comatose! Ignore the bad reviews,  so they don't like the lighting,  they don't wanna put quarters in the meter,  they don't like the deco,  they hate coming downtown,  they want to order cheese tacos,  people please,  don't be a Steve.\n\nThis place is authentic southern Mexican food!!"
2,"The husband and I wanted to hit up a few good buffets during our stay. We received mixed reviews for the Wynn buffet, but found it easy to eat at since we were going to watch le reve. After standing in line for about 20 mins (on a Tuesday around 7pm) we were seated. The entry way is gorg but lead back the buffet area the decor seemed a bit outdated, but still very nice.\n\nThe food experience - I just didn't find anything special. The food is all good, but nothing was drool worthy.  They have salads, american, Italian, grilled foods, ramen station, asian and seafood. It was a great variety, but like I said nothing stood out. My favorite was the dessert bar. It had a good variety."
2,"At first I was so turned off by this place b/c its kind of like the Walmart of Vegas in terms of hotels. But my friend and I were going to see GNR so we figured lets just make it easy and stat at the HRH this time. The last show we saw there was Motley Crue and we stayed at a hotel down the street but getting a cab back at 3:30 in the morning sucks plus we had to leave the next day so this was an easier option. We booked a room in the Hard Rock Tower and it was spacious with a nice set up and very clean. The lights didn't work in the shower and we couldn't hook up our iPhone 5s to the sound system in the room so that was a bummer but we still liked the set up. \n\nThe pools could be nice b/c they are huge and there are different styles - like one with a sandy bottom, waterfalls, and islands to hang out on. But they are so gross b/c there are way too many people there and it's nasty when you think about what is floating around in there (fecal matter comes to mind - ewwwww!). The worst part about that is you can actually see a bunch of nastiness floating in the pool - oil, what looks to be skin, and hair. It really freaks me out but we knew going there the Hard Rock is known for their party atmosphere especially poolside. In my 20s i would have been into the huge party scene at the pool but being a fresh 40 year old, I am over that stuff. I liked a quiet pool with less people. The Hard Rock is complete opposite - people throwing balls back and forth, everyone is wasted or on their way to that point, music is blaring louder than a night club, and girls grinding on each other to impress tatted out muscle dudes they never met. We spent about 90 minutes poolside each day b/c we went for GNR not for hanging at the pool. \n\nMr. Lucky's is the 24 hour restaurant and it's where I had the WORST meal I ever ate. The eggs were chewy and inedible and they even messed up the English muffin. Seriously how do you do that? Plus it was pricey for shitty food. I was most upset that I wasted valuable stomach space but I didn't eat much. I spent $20 for breakfast and was only able to stomach an eighth of it. Wasteful but it was truly one of the worst meals I ever had. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother eating there.\n\nFu - we had dinner here one night and none of us was impressed. I guess I had high expectations and was very excited for \""Chinese\"" food but it wasn't good. Out of 4 of us, 1 person liked their meal. The staff was friendly though and the meal wasn't horrible it just wasn't what we were hoping for. \n\nCulinary Dropout: This is the BEST restaurant at the Hard Rock. They have the best staff - so much fun. We loved our servers and went here 3 times in 2 days! Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled. Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. \n\nThe Joint: I love this venue b/c it's small and the set up is cool b/c everyone has a good seat plus is you want to go to the bar you can still see the stage. Overall, we had a good experience but I would only stay here again if I was going to a show at the Joint b/c it's too far from the strip which limits my feeding choices :O)"
3,"this stores great for both foods, daily needs and customer service! I only went in there for a few minutes but dealt with about 3 different people and all were absolutely great. everyone is so friendly and easy going.\n\nplus they sell hcg1234.\n\nim just sayin... =)"
4,"Located off the strip, on the other side of the 15 freeway is the Palace Station Hotel. I have never set foot in this hotel/casino in my life until my friend told me that I need to go try the Oyster Bar here. Although, I'm not a big fan of raw oysters because of what it can potentially do to my bowels, I was assured that they have plenty of other (sea)food items to choose from.\n\nThe Oyster Bar is literally a horse shoe style bar (think shabu shabu). No frills, no tables, just a bar and stools. Everything is made, prepped, and served right in front of you. Because of this, be prepared to wait. It's worth it, trust me! Although we only had about eight people in front of us, it still took about an hour to get seated. Also, if you roll deep, expect to split up. This place though is opened 24/7. Maybe if you creep in around 4am then the line will be short unless all the drunken clubbers and strippers are present.\n\nIt seems like everyone has mixed reviews about the different food items here. Personally, the House Gumbo ($20) is the Royal Flush in my opinion. It's big enough for two people. The flavor will blow the socks off your feet. I had a New Orleans native with me and even she was impressed. I would come back and wait the long @$$ line just for this. I've been fantasizing about this gumbo ever since.\n\nThe jambalaya was my next favorite item we shared. It was a little bit runny at first but as the rice sits, it'll slowly soaks up the sauce. Another flavorful delight and massive in size.\n\nThe Seafood Pan Roast was good but it doesn't trump the other two items I sampled. It's heavily raved about, but I can go back to the Oyster Bar and pass it up.\n\nI like how each of these items was made right in front of us in these cool looking, silver/metal gadgets. It's hard to explain what they are so just check out the pictures or go there yourself and pay attention to how your food is being made. You'll be fascinated at how easy the chefs will make it look. Their secret is in the pre-made sauces of course. Our chef Blake was calm and collective even though he had a lot on his plate. Patrons were eagerly gawking at each dish he made, impatiently waiting their bite.\n\nFew suggestions: try not to come during peaked times. Share dishes and be aware that the portions are huge. Also, keep the party to a minimum unless you don't mind splitting up. Lastly, bring your appetite and taste buds because like watching Seigfreid and Roy, you're about to get mesmerized."
0,"Normally i have an okay time here. My last visit wasnt even okay. \n\nI didnt even get a chance to eat here and had to leave due to the terrible service. We took a seat at the bar and ordered the deep dish pizza we were craving all diggity day long and a brown ale, along with a couple waters. Then we watched the bartenders behind the bar have internal drama and not even look in our direction as we waited.....and waited........annnnnnd waited. Neither the bar nor the dining area was busy or even half full and i sat for 17 minutes without even the orders for the waters go fulfilled. \nAt that point i had seen enough and had to walk out before the food and drinks even arrived. I hated to do it but i could not support the staff and business where that could happen. \n\nThe bottom line is that it was a bad experience but the food i have had here in the past has always been solid, the beer is surprisingly good and priced very well."
4,"Amazing. Amazing Amazning. \n\nI have been here 3 times and each time has been stellar! I have had the filet, the sea bass and the flank steak and all were just delicious. The wood fired grill really gives the steaks a unique flavor. The mushrooms....just to die for.\n\nThe best and most amazing part (if you ask me) are the frits you get (for free) as starters. They all have individual dips too. Nom nom. \n\nThe service is impeccable as well. I have a background as a waitress, so I always like to see how the waiters take orders, etc. I don't get to say this too often, but they were on point. \n\nThe martinis are made to perfection. The restaurant's ambiance is gorgeous and of course it's in Vegas, which is our favorite vacation destination spot!"
1,"Not sure how to rate this place. I tried to order breakfast based on other people in my office. I ran into a little snag, the menu I have for them doesn't list their phone number. Only a web address! Get this the website is down under construction! How do you print menu's with no phone number and only a web address that is under construction? I could not find a number on the web either. Before coming here I called the Tempe location they didn't know the number either nor did they care to try and get it for me they hung up! Bad business. So as of right now I cannot rate the food only the sucky service. I doubt I will be trying the food after this fiasco!"
3,"It's getting cooler in Vegas, and therefore, it is HOT POT SEASON!\n\nI dropped by here with two friends and we ended up sharing two hot pots, and three orders of skewers. Everything was really good. Each of the hot pots were loaded with various vegetables and mushrooms. They could have done with a bit more meat though. I felt that each of the hot pots had too less meat for the amount of soup/veggies inside. \n\nNext... What's hot pot without SAUCES!  Normally, I like to eat my hotpot with a sauce consisting of peanut butter, cilantro, green onions, sa cha (barbeque) sauce, and an egg. I was sad that they didn't have any peanut butter (instead, I used some sesame paste they had, it kind of did the job), and i had to pay an extra 50 cents for an egg.  Seeing as there was not much meat to begin with, I opted to not get the egg. :(\n\nWe had an order of each of the skewers (beef, beef tongue, and lamb). I really loved the beef tongue and the lamb skewers, but the regular beef skewer was just so-so.\n\nAll in all, this place is great for a nice warm meal at night, and I would definitely come back to try their other hot pots! =]"
2,"Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and for the purpose of this review this does not mean anything else but: I'm proud of my food and I can be very strict with anything served as / associated with/ recognised as Mexican. Next, three facts:\n\n1. Burritos can be found in their natural habitat only in the north of Mexico. And not all the north, but only some states. It's a very simple snack: a flour tortilla with a bit of beans and cheese (the most traditional one). You can also find burritos with other fillings (generally two, being one either beans or cheese). That's all, no rice, no cream, no guacamole, no salsa, etc... \n\n2. Burritos are now a very popular fast-food snack in the US, possibly more popular in the south of the US where lots of Mexican immigrants live these days. Therefore, burritos are part of what is now known as tex-mex food. I've never tried a burrito in the US so I don't know how they are served but I presume this is where burritos took their now more popular looks and taste.\n\n3. Los Cardos does not intend to serve real Mexican food or Mexican real burritos. They got the idea from the Californian tex-mex burrito and offer a healthier alternative to take-away food at a reasonable price, and using fresh ingredients and good quality products. This is what the website says (go and check if you want).\n\nSo now I think it will be fair to say that...\n\nLos Cardos' \""interpretation\"" and/or \""re-construction\"" of burritos is a successful one and I think the success is the result of taking some common ingredients in Mexican food (beans, rice, salsa verde, coriander, cream, etc) with others not so common (like carnitas) and still leave room for the costumer's choice. Sounds like a winning formula, right? So basically, you choose the type of tortilla, the type of meat, the fillings, the salsas. How tasty your burrito will turn out to be, well... it's up to you.\n\nWhile I was observing how my burrito was prepared (a carnitas burrito) with all the fillings I chose (cheese, cream, beans, rice, coriander, the whole lot really) the guy explained to me about the quality of products and freshness. And yes, very fresh and well prepared. So, what they say they offer is what you'll get. By the way, very friendly staff.\n\nAs a take-away you're not expecting the premises to be memorable. And as I was not planning to eat my burrito there, I didn't really pay attention to where costumers could eat. I do remember very vaguely to see a couple of tables with costumers. \n\nI paid for my burrito a bit more than 5 pounds. A massive burrito. And I know it is a reasonable price for take-away food in the UK -and even more if good quality products are taken into account, but I still think it is rather pricy. Or perhaps I can't be objective enough (I can't help comparing prices of burritos in Mexico and they don't cost much at all... it's a snack!). Let's say that compared to other take-away snacks (kebabs, for instance), Los Cardos' burritos are probably within the price range.\n\nSo... Is this place good? I think it is. Is this good for Mexicans (especially the ones from the north)? Perhaps... it all depends how orthodox / flexible you are. Will I go back? If I'm in the area, quite possibly. \n\nBeing far from Mexico, not having \""my\"" food here, has had many different interesting effects: I cook more, I've discovered markets and delis where I can find Mexican products (will write a review of Lupe Pintos soon!) but I have also learnt to appreciate other foods. To me, Los Cardos' burritos, as they say on their website, are purely inspiration. And as that, I take it... Yet, I was the most grateful Mexican when I first smelt the carnitas and a very subtle hint of orange transported me to a street market full of bright colours and music. Perhaps it was just an illusion or perhaps I was just... inspired."
0,"This steakhouse really shows its age, in a sad way. Food and service are overrated. Tourists may still go there, along with people who equate dull with reassuring.\n\nDo avoid, unless you're invited or dating the wrong person."
3,"I rode the light rail with a friend and met another friend at the Arizona Science Center for a meetin.org event. We had Groupons for the planetarium and exhibits. We watched the planetarium show on planets first. I was a little disappointed in the planetarium show because the narrator (who was VERY good with the kids!) went into detail about the planets. I had hoped to learn about constellations, so obviously I had chosen the wrong show. My bad. I liked how interactive  the show was, allowing us to push buttons to vote.\n\nI enjoyed the exhibits, especially the four seasons. That was cool having the wind blow in our faces one second, and standing there getting sprinkled in the rain during the storm the next second.\n\nMy friends went through the exhibits much faster than I would have liked, so I will be back a second and possibly third time. I'm waiting for the next Groupon before I buy my ticket."
3,Mmmm... Beer... and the grub ain't to shabby either.\n\nWho does not like roasted peanuts with the shell and pitch them on the floor after eating the nuts?
0,"Slow, painfully slow service.  Only one register open regardless of the length of line.  They exist only because they have a perfect location.  Unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in.  Wait times for food are horrendous.  There will be numerous people with food in hand in line, yet they sometimes have the only register person also making espresso drinks (slowing down the entire line).  I guess that 2nd register at the end is just for show."
0,"I give them one star for being open. Other than that...service was horrible, they ran out of the pasta for the dish ordered and a roach measuring almost three inches ran across my friends foot then up the wall behind the wine bottles. The manager just moved us to the table next to where we were sitting. Oh and did I mention the restaurant was empty!  Needless to say I will never go back to this neighborhood restaurant."
1,"I was so excited to try this place out and hyped it up so much I didn't think it could disappoint. I saw this place featured on Man v. Food and on countless billboards around the Strip. This location, inside Imperial Palace, had a huge line and fairly long wait. I was famished and didn't mind the wait as long as the food lived up to all the hype. Before I even looked at the menu, I knew I wanted to order their signature dish...the chicken and waffles. While I waited for my order to arrive, I saw a wide arry of delicious dishes being zipped back and forth in front of our table. All looked craftly plated, with huge heaping portions. I salivated each time my beloved (or so I thought) chicken and waffles would zip in and out of my line of sight. Finally it arrived, moment of truth. I bite into my deep fried chicken breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. Batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch I had imagined. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved on to the waffles, hoping that Hash House would redeem themselves here. But alas, I was disappointed yet again. The waffles were huge, and filed with bacon which made my eyes grow large with a childlike wonder, yet I lamented again when I found those waffles to be soggy and rather flat in flavor. \n\nNeedless to say I walked away from this place pretty much disappointed. Will probably not be returning anytime soon...at least not on my own accord."
4,Too bad but this shop has closed.  They were really good.  Now we do not have a real coffee shop.
0,"Food probably gets 2 1/2 stars. The waffles and chicken was pretty good.  But nothing spectacular. \n\nMostly upset about being seated in the worst table in the restaurant even thought it was about 90% empty when we walked in. When we asked for a booth they said sorry that's for party of 5 or more. This was obviously a lie as they went ahead and seated two groups later with 4 people. And they were all white. Very disappointing.  What's even worse, we all had stomach \""problems\"" afterwards. All in all a horrible experience."
1,First time at Extreme Pita.  It is a little different than Pita Pit. I had the small smoked turkey and my husband had the buffalo chick.  Was not impressed with the food nor the staff. Not sure we will go back.
4,"Great, fresh food and excellent service. They never disappoint. A perfect place to be a \""regular\"". They always remember what we like to eat and serve with a smile."
2,"I only Mcd's for their breakfast sammichs, apple pie or sundaes. Other than that, this place is nassssstay!\n\nDon't forget to ask for military discount!"
1,"Oh no, a breakfast place that doesn't know how to make an omelet?  For shame.  Oh no, a restaurant staff that doesn't care if you enjoyed your meal, even worse.  It's really too bad because the first time I went here the place was decent, it's why I decided to make a return trip, even though it's not technically in my 'hood. \n\n I had the coffee cake again and though it is pretty good it's not good enough to have to throw the rest of the meal away.  I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.  \n\nWhat was worse, when I went to pay and was asked how my meal was, I was honest.  I got a shrug and an ho hum, oh well.  I won't be back."
0,"I chose not to get a tattoo here after my experience during the consultation. I set up an appointment in advance but when I came to my appointment I was told the person was busy with another appointment. I waited until that appointment was over and then I met with the artist. I explained to her I wanted a tattoo on my right leg and she told me the leg would be too painful to do. I already had a tattoo on my left leg, so I did not see what the problem was? A leg tattoo has not hurt me any different from any of my other tattoos. It just seemed like the artist was trying to make excuses to not do my tattoo. In general, it seemed like the tattoo shop had 2 receptionists working and neither of them addressed me when I walked in or offered to help me in any way. I had to approach them to ask about my appointment and how much longer the wait would be, since obviously making an appointment did not seem to guarantee anyone would see me.But the ultimate reason I chose not to continue to work with the artist there, besides her telling me she couldn't do a tattoo on my leg, was because she suggested to me that I should get liposuction. She said it would be a better investment for me to pay for plastic surgery rather than get a tattoo and that I should consider losing some weight before I get any tattoos. I am an average sized person - I would not consider myself overweight and I was insulted she would tell me that I need to get liposuction before she would tattoo me. Customer service is not a priority at Club Tattoo. And my experience with this artist has made me not want to go to any Club Tattoo location for future work."
3,Excellent food! Great prices....\nI love the #6 Steak and kobedah( ground Beef) with rice and salad. About $10
4,"French cooking with some interesting fusions going on, Passion8 is one of the best restaurants in the metro.  Fois Gras that is expertly made without being cloying or compromising, lamb and duck just as you'd find them on the Right Bank, and an impressive beer and wine list make this a great date night/business meeting location."
1,"A lot of older hotels on the strip have had renovations in attempt to keep up with newer chic hotels such as Aria and The Cosmopolitan. Tropicana made an effort, but fell short. \n\nService is unreasonably slow, both in receiving service and trying to reach it. A little over forty five minutes for room service to arrive with food. We had ordered appetizers and a rare burger. The food was on the colder end toward lukewarm. Had asked for towels and had them arrive after forty five minutes and a \""reminder call\"". Same sort of service at their Beach Club restaurant. The people are wonderfully nice though. \n\nI wouldn't return. Not for the service, or the tub that doesn't plug, or the shower head that doesn't stay, or the long walk to the room from any entrance.\u00a0It's just not worth the money. The room was okay at best.\n\nLots of older people as well, not that it was an issue, just a heads up."
2,"After seeing pictures of the red velvet waffle, I wanted to come try it.  I came on a Sunday afternoon.  The wait was about 45 minutes, but I was able to get a seat at the bar, after about 20 minutes. \nThe waffle, topped with cream cheese drizzle was good overall, but I think it would help with the authenticity of red velvet if there was cocoa in the batter.\nBesides that, I had a cup of coffee, which was good and a side of fruit.\n\nI would consider Terrace Cafe again for a breakfast or brunch spot."
3,"Hmm, I can't say too much about this place because I came in a bit tipsy ;P\nOther than the good atmosphere and good seating area, this place is great for watching the games.\nI've tried a sip of black velvet from a friend, and I must say, it's the best I've tried by far..."
0,"Terrible service.  The food is typically good, but not consistant.  My experience today was bad enough that i'm certain i'll never go back."
4,"Happiness is a warm bagel.\n\nOwen's claim to fame is their bagel steaming process.  Before I came here, I had no idea what bagel steaming entailed, but it beats the heck out of toasting.  Bagels (and bagel sandwiches) go in the steamer as regular bagels.  A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese. \n\nI ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.  Think toasted Quiznos, but with better ingredients.\n\nThe wide range of menu items can be a little overwhelming if you're looking at the variety of posters suspended from the ceiling.  Your better bet is to grab a printed menu from the counter.\n\nPerhaps the only thing better than a steamed bagel from this shop is a steamed cookie.  The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.  But if you can talk your server into popping a cookie into the steamer, it comes out chewey and melty like it was fresh from the oven.\n\nOwen's bagel shop might be a little tough to find, but the bagels make it worth seeking out."
4,I look forward to every visit! I always get exactly what I ask for.  I prefer the more natural look and she always delivers! I enjoy my many compliments but always give her the credit she deserves. She is a beautiful artist who makes me feel beautiful too. Thanks!!
4,This nail salon was recommended by a friend for the wonderful service and cheap pedicures.  I was a little skeptical at first but the price was too good to be true to not give it a try.  I actually decided to upgrade my pedicure to a more luxurious one and it was wonderful.  My tech. spent an hour just massaging my feet and legs.  I had the seaweed and cucumber mask done as well which made my feet so soft.  I decided at the last minute to get my eyebrows waxed as well and my tech did a fantastic job on that as well.  I would definitely recommend them to others and will be going back for sure.
2,A good choice for Mexican food
2,"I've had the pizza as well as a veal sorrentino. The pizza is good. Can't say that it stands out from most other places, but it's definitely worth trying at least once. The veal sorrentino was good. A big portion. I could only finish half. I'd be interested in trying other entrees. The calzones were oozing with cheese. Seemed like a ton of cheese. If you're into cheese you'd love a calzone. Prices were reasonable and there were a few specials. If you've wanted to try this place, I'd say it is definitely worth a try."
0,"The service is miserable. When I say miserable, I mean you could go ten minutes without seeing a single worker. I ate her lunch Saturday and Sunday since it was close to my room. The salad I had the first day, the strawberries were frozen. And it was a 17 dollar salad.  Dont waste your time."
0,I would have rather stayed at the super 8 motel than this place ever again. I stayed here 3 years ago ANC the room itself was dirty and there was a unidentified red streak in the wall that looked like blood. It never rains in Vegas but the one time it did was when we were staying here and it was the most rainfall recorded in years... The room 2 doors down's ceiling collapsed and the whole floor smelled like mildew. Not one person checked up on us or anything and when we said something about the smell the didn't move us or anything. I will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either.
3,".8 star for atmosphere\n.8 star for service\n.8 star for cleanliness\n1.2 of 2 stars for food\n\nStreets of New York, Camelback 2 blocks east of Central\n\nPizza & Wings, Those are Our Things\n\nDecember 2008, the Phoenix Metro area christened its\nlight rail system.  Running from Mesa to North Phoenix,\nit takes a turn west at Central and Camelback. There's\nalso a train stop at this major junction.  Streets of New \nYork is a two block walk.  One can work up an appetite\ngoing and walk off a meal on the way back to the train.    \n\nIt's called \""Streets of New York\"" because it serves New York\nstyle food, especially pizza.  Thin crust, tomato sauce, and\nwhatever you want on top.  There are several made-up\nchoices, including the original pizza of New York , the \nMargherita.  There's also a full Italian menu but we are\nserved  only pizza and wings.  \n\nAnd served we are.  We've always had good service here.\nThere's a full-service bar, several large screen TV's giving\nthe place a sports-bar flavor.  There's seating outside when\nit's desired.\n\nWe get a large pizza in our pizza and wings special, medium heat\non the wings.  We eat half in the restaurant and take half home\nfor that great well-mixed flavor of heated day-old pizza.\n\nTraveling?  Birthday party?  Family night out?  A little romance?\nOur last trip there was some serious business talk in a \ntable near the corner.  Give it a try."
4,"There really isn't a reason to review this place, but I will anyways.  It's simply the best club in Vegas.  Just make sure you have a good ratio, you buy a bottle, or give a host a nice handshake."
0,"The food here is not so great. I do not recommend anyone coming here to spend money. The service was okay but not how a diner should be. Blt, no mayo? Really? Weird. The toast was over toasted and very chewy. The bacon was over cooked. Ehh kind of place. Will not be back."
4,"We were looking for something to satisfy our hunger and walking into the Miles Mall this was the first place we ran into. There wasn't a line as we went there on a Saturday afternoon. You can pick your sandwich and add chips and drink to your order. They give you the buzzer and you wait for your sandwich to get done.\n\nI ordered the All American sandwich, which had roasted turkey and cranbarry sauce in it. It was very tasty and everybody else liked their sandwiches too. It tasted very fresh and the bread was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outsite. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly and helpfull. Would definitely go back there."
0,Over priced and disorganized!
1,"I used to love this place. So much so, that I gave them several chances to remind me of that long lost love affair. Last 3 out of 3 times has been terrible. My hot and sour soup came to me about the color of mustard. And it was sickeningly sweet. My fried wontons were virtually meatless, and my combo fried rice didn't have any discerning flavor at all. $20 later and all i can say is that I'm so disappointed.  I will never order from them again. I will stick with Red House for my wonton fix and continue to search for a go to place for fried rice."
2,"Pizza was ah ok. Being a pizza-aficionado I guess I'm hard to please. Good lunch spot. Very popular. PIzza was too sparse. Very commercial. Ingredients were fresh, cheese not the best but a quick spot to grab lunch. Sort of a cafeteria feel."
0,Went to eat buffet. This is the Worst food ever I eat. All the dishes are tasteless. I won't recommend this to anyone.
1,"Very disappointed.  Prices are high and the resort fee rubs you wrong.  We rented 2 rooms on the \""family plan\""', only to find the pricing on Expedia to be much better - to late, 3 day cancellation.  Both of our rooms had extremely dirty carpet, and one was supposed to be a suite.  How carpet gets that dirty on the 6th floor I will never know but I really don't think it's been shampooed in years.  Paddle boarding is $30 first hour then $20 an hour after that.  Food prices in all restaurants is very high with not many options off property.  This property does not live up to the westin name.  I wouldn't suggest anyone stay at this location"
1,"After a day of shopping at Chandler Fashion we decided to stop in, watch the Cardinals game and relax with good food and exceptional beer. Just prior to arriving at BJ's our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other \""restaurants\"" into \""her\"" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our \""contraband\"" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit."
1,"Food is average, but the ordering process is absolutely terrible. Technology gone wrong. Doubt I'll be back"
3,"This is an interesting place to be sure. It is reminiscent of a Manhattan bar or at the very least something in a bigger more cramped city. This place is neatly camouflaged in a strip mall near a Fresh and Easy. The decor was very interesting, very dark though (no natural light in this place)\n\nI came here with a friend on a Thursday evening (another Yelper ... I'll be curious to see his review). The place was packed to the brim, which isn't really hard to do. Both of us ordered cocktails. I had the Russian Mule (vodka, ginger beer and lime juice), he had a Blueberry Hill. I didn't sample his cocktail, but mine was de-lish. I ordered the sweet and hot burger which had candied Jalapenos. The burger was huge and piping hot. My main criticism of the burger is that the burger is so big that you have to take it apart (which I do anyway - an odd deconstructionist habit, but nonetheless, I want to at least take a bite or two of the whole thing). The \""herbed fries\"" were forgettable. Nothing special about them really. Service was efficient, and the check was split with no attitude (which is a good thing), although, the waitress was a bit slow to pick up our checks. \n\nOverall this is a good burger place. The meat was good and tasty,the booze is good. Sides could use a tad of an improvement. I do prefer Delux Burger over this place still. At least there I can eat the burger as a sandwich (if I want to) and not as a take apart.\n\nGrades:\n\nOVERALL:    B- \n\nService:   B-    (Service was attentive, but slowness in picking up the\n                         check is not a plus) \n\nFood:     B- (Burger was good, but too large, and fries were forgettable)\n\nDrinks:  B (It's good, but not something I'd write  home about) \n\n(just in case you're wondering - I give A's only if it's superior)"
1,"the sandwich was amazing....but defintiely not worth $9. I've definitely had better.  It didn't even come with a side. great location and outdoor seating, but overrated."
3,"Oh Sunset Bowl. How do I put this gently. I'm not one to just spurt out my opinion...BUT DAMN YOU ARE WEIRD...Oooooppps. Sorry. Let me say, I had af fantastic time. I bowled my ass off. I slipped. I guttered. I drank more Bud Light than I have since 8th grade yearbook camp. Damn. I am so bloated. Front desk/shoe rental fiasco with Dave, the lovely Jacqui and I was, well, it was puberty. Puberty?. You know...awkward. I mentioned the yelp event and John was aware but not, shall we say, oh, um helpful. \""Go wait in the bar!\"" As typical of my thirsty, nerdish, self,  I was first. I don' t mind being told to wait in the bar (OK, Kristin, stop lauging), but again haven't heard that since 8th grade yearbook camp as well. Bar service was attentive, yet uneventful, not energetic and I realize what it's like not to fee like a regular. Cuz she really focused on them. Too bad I wasn't wearing a fishing cap, sporting an unkept mustache and drinking, drinking...oh,um I know...BUD LITE! Stardust was clean, had great murals on the walls and a great scoring computer thing mcbob. But had NO tables for our beers and snack. Can't wait to bowl again!"
3,"While in Vegas for Christmas we were in the mood for spicy beef.  While on the strip, we used Yelp to help us navigate our way to good Korean food - on Christmas Day!\n\nWe called ahead to make sure they were open and yes was the answer I wanted to hear.\n\nFrom the M & M Factory we made our way and when we got there, every seat was taken.  Good sign.\n\nOur wait was only 10 minutes, we sat down and the server arrived with glasses of water within minutes.  The place was packed with a lot of people there, we knew this place had to be good.\n \nThe menu is like any menu you see at other Korean restaurants so it was hard to decide what we wanted.  I wanted Dolsot Bibimbap and my BF had Bulgogi.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and I must say, that is the best Dolsot I ever had.  Everything was tasty."
2,"My mom ostensibly refers to this place as \""Rainbow Rumpus Room\""\nI have no freaking clue why, but that is what it is to me. So without further ado, my review of RRR:\nWhat a strange and awesome little discount grocery outlet.\nIts like they get all the refuse from bigger grocery retailers, mark them down ten fold and pray to god they dont expire before they get their merch out the door\nIts like stepping into a giant bodega, a sprawling warehouse of misfit groceries, w/out homes.\nI was very hesitant about shopping here, and well lets face it- Food City is more appealing than this place\nBut that would only be to those who haven't actually gone in and perused the wares, 'cause appearances as we all know...can be misleading\nI love this place. I wouldnt shop here too much for food, but the wines are insanely cheap! the toiletries and household goods here are practically being given away. I pick up my toms of maine's all natural products here for a fraction of what they'd cost elsewhere. The prices are just really great, and if i still lived on the West side, i'd do a good deal of my shopping here.\nIf you live in the area and haven't been, do yourself a favor, lower your expectations and prepare to be quite pleased. \nRainbow Rumpus Room, I tip my hat to you."
3,"I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P"
0,"I placed the order for coworkers birthday. Order successfully went through and receive a confirmation email. The next day when the order was supposed to be delivered to our job, they never showed up. The online check is a joke and is inaccurate. When I called the next day to cancel the order, the order number was completely wrong and was mass confusion. Then they went on to tell me they tried to deliver the arrangement but the business was closed. Which was untrue because the business didn't close till 10 PM. Had to haggle to get a refund back. Didn't receive an apology or any compensation what so ever."
2,"I have to say, I don't understand the rave reviews.  I wanted to love this place.  However, I can't get over the insanely bad service.\n\nFirst- the good. I do LOVE the interior. The decor is great.  The drink list- great. \n\nThat is where the greatness ended. I went with several coworkers for a Thursday evening happy hour. The place was packed. This is usually a good sign!  Our experience at the bar wasn't too bad. It took a while for drinks, but that is to be expected due to the crowd.  The bartender was friendly, once he was able to circle back to us, our drinks were timely and well done. \n\nAfter an hour we moved to a table. By this time, the crowd had thinned. The waitress literally stopped by our table 3 times in two hours (I kept track).  Service is key to any restaurant and it flat out sucks here. We were spending hundreds on drinks, appetizers, and dinner. Oh wait, we never got to actually order dinner because the waitress never checked back in after our appetizers.  By the time we got appetizers they were cold (each flatbread, truffle fries, and others I can't recall). They may have been good, but cold fries aren't pleasant. \n\nWhat a missed opportunity.  I can't stand when places go all out on decor and developing atmosphere/quality menu and skimp on service. \n\nI had colleagues there the same night in a separate party. It took 40 minutes for their drinks. 1 hour for appetizers. 1 hour and 5 minutes for dinner.  The timing sounds off to you too?  They won't be back. I may give it another shot. However, FIX YOUR SERVICE!  It has repeatedly been raised in comments. I hope Ten Penny listens. We could use them, it is a great concept."
1,"Like many other reviewers, we tried Padre's because of a Groupon. \n\nWait staff was competent, and our drinks stayed mostly full.\n\nWe had the calamari as an appetizer: very overpriced at $10.95, I liked the flavor (its got a little chili mixed in with the breading). I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.\n\nFor entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the \""Tia's Enchiladas\"" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren't bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife's enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not \""huge\"".\n\nFor desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn't true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.\n\nThen the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel. We cancelled the desert order. It was a bit frustrating that the manager didn't know how the dishes were prepped in the kitchen.\n \nOverall, it was typical mexican food with a \""modern\"" take (apparently if you put pineapple salsa on shrimp tacos and a fancy swirl of sauce on the enchiladas its \""modern\"") -- personally, there are much better Mexican restaurants in town."
2,"Came here based off the reviews. Sapphires reviews were bad so we passed. The girls here are pretty good lookin just a few here n there that made me ask how did they even get the job. Seats everywhere and the I like how there is a center stage and a main stage.\n\nThe bad I came in there with no cash so the ATM was my first stop. Bouncer told me the charge was like 2.50 mmm no how about they charge $10 or 9% for every transaction which ever is greater.. I'm not really caring at this point until it hit me I'm going to be charged 10 for 20 dollars ughh PLEASE bring cash the ATM will kill your pockets as well. Women's bathroom ..,. Well u share it with the strippers and a Mexican service lady and the room is soo small you would think 5 strippers wouldn't hang in there taking selfies. The dancing overall was basic only a couple would do pole tricks smh and drinks are soso. \n\nIf u find a man on the street make sure u tell him u want ladies in free or u are not going"
1,"Returned in hopes of another afternoon feeding the birds/ducks/geese and fun time at the park. Alas, we showed up with a full bag of white bread and some crackers, typical fowl faire. First thing I noticed versus last time was that ALL the birds/ducks/geese have turned into ultra aggressive, threatening beasts from a B-movie. They were mobbing me nearly to the point of an altercation. I am 6'6\"" and felt a bit freaked., my 6 year old was managing better than I. I was answered by a friendly, although haggard security guard. He screamed from nearby, STOP, DONT FEED THE BIRDS. Seems they have a few signs that say the same. I asked him about this a few minutes after stopping and he told me it is city rules now. One,\""white bread isn't good for ducks. Unbuttered popcorn is best.\"" Two,\""people have complained about the poop on the sidewalks.\"" So, thanks to all you ultra-animal lovers and snobby moms for ruining this rather enjoyable time for us all. But, i guess we all foot the bill to pay this poor man who has to holler at parents with kids like a Grinch when he could muster up his dignity to work somewhere protecting or safeguarding something more valuable than your crummy loafers and animals that I have never seen suffer from gobbling up Wonder Bread. Give me a Friggen Break... \nThe park was still fun and we had a good time regardless. \nGeez, just what this city needs know on a stretched budget, \""Duck Police\"". Great job you all who are scared of nature and the scary things it might leave on your precious sidewalks. And BTW, animal lovers, they brought the ducks to live at the pond! There are MANY other places that might need your attention than this one park..."
0,- Wrong directions to our hotel room from the guy at the front desk\n- No room service (No fresh towals etc.)\n- Wifi didnt work very well\n- TV lost signal often\nbtw do not lift up any bottles from the minibar. They will charge you each bottle due to sensors in the fridge. \n\nI complained at the checkout and they took care about the Hotel fees + Tax (56 Dollars something for two days)
4,"My original online order from a different company had never delivered to my mother-in-law home for her birthday on time... so I called English Garden Florist for a \""emergency delivery\""! And they were EXCELLENT!! They saved my day!\nThe customer service (over the phone) were nice, efficient and professional!! The price is absolutely reasonable. And the beautiful floral arrangement was delivered to my mother-in-law's door step within 1 hour and half after I placed the order over the phone, on a Sunday! \nMy mother-in-law was very pleased with the FRESH BEAUTIFUL arrangement she received! Thank you English Garden Florist! Highly recommended!"
0,I ordered #23 the spicy beef soup. It was so bad I could only take 5 bites and had to stop before I puked. The meat was about 60% fat and the noodles tasted like they had been soaking in water for a week. The broth had no flavor and there was some kind of organ meat under the noodles. Go down the street to Pho Thanh.
2,"I just got back from seeing the Misfits in concert at this joint. It seems smaller than the more well-known House of Blues out there in terms of 'small venues', although a bit bigger than the Railhead at Boulder Station.\n\nThe way the club is set up is kind of strange. There are two bars: one outside the actual stage area and one inside. Then in front of that is the pit and stage of course.\n\nSurprisingly, there's enough room to move around for moshing and crowd surfing. The security here don't seem to care if you start moshing, but if it gets too rowdy then they might stop you. If you're a repeat offender, they may kick you out.\n\nThe acoustics of this place sound very muddled, and I had a hard time deciphering what the band was singing. The instruments also seemed to blend together in a bad way. These are the only downsides to this joint.\n\nA lot of punk rock bands play here, and the week before the Misfits' tour was The Casualties along with Negative Approach and several other bands. LVCS seems to be the 'punk house' for the scene. Hey, that's cool--brings a little more 'arts and culture' to the downtown area, which is something that's badly needed besides First Friday.\n\nThis place should actually be renamed the 'Las Vegas Punk Saloon' since more punk bands play here than country ones. That, go pyschobilly/rockabilly if they wanna stay a little bit Country.\n\nI still think that bands should book somewhere else--the sound is just terrible, plus it's sort of hard to see the bands at times since the stage isn't raised.\n\nOtherwise, not bad for cheap tickets. You'll never find tickets here that cost more than $40. They're all reasonably priced, especially for the amount of bands you're seeing.\n\nP.S. the highlight of the Misfits concert was seeing Jerry Only get off the stage and French-kiss this punk rock chick that was directly in front of him. Mind you, Jerry's in his 50s now, and the chick he kissed seemed to be in her early-to-mid 20s or so. Just damn, man. Then again, I would still hit that no matter what age--Jerry is still hot to me."
2,"They weren't busy so the server was on the money! I tried the pulled pork fajitas and my girlfriend try the chicken fajitas. The veggies and tortillas were awesome but everything else kind of lacked flavor. The server brought out plenty of chips with three different kinds of salsa. They were unique but none really popped for me. We ordered some fried ice cream, a necessity at a Mexican restaurant, and after about 15 minutes the waitress informed us that they didn't have it. The manager offered to buy us desserts for the inconvenience, which was pretty awesome if u ask me. I had the key lime pie and the kids had the kids Sunday. I will have to try this place again and see if something else on the menu has some Zing."
3,"Stayed a week in a one bedroom suite in the Monte Carlo tower. I arrived late, called in and my room was held for. Nice and clean room, only issue is the outdated and torn furniture makes it look tacky but I get it to keep up with the legacy. I called for an extra blanket, and to have my toilet fixed. Was fixed right away. My room was cleaned everyday.  I ate the R and steak during happy hour was good. Ate at the banana leaf that was good. Was it worth what paid for, It purpose was served for me to lay my head at flexible hotel while on my vacation.  Wi-Fi worked, was slow one day I assumed due to maybe an overload of useage. Pool was opened but I didn't get in. The flat screens TVs work, so did the iPod dock. the showers was clean, the hot tub was as well."
1,"Disappointing to say the least... Good service but the food was terrible!  We would not return here there are many better places nearby,,,,,,,,"
3,The food was pretty good but it's really the experience you are coming here for. The most interesting dining experience I have had in years. Highly recommend to try it once. Go on the weekdays when it's a little less busy and try to stay in smaller groups. It will make the experience a little easier the first time.
3,I have to write this review to counter all the bad reviews. Granted the service is NOT always the best. I think they have a very small staff which is kind of a catch 22. But their sizzling beef is incredible. It is about my most favorite dish in the whole Vegas valley. Great quality beef and so tasty. So if you are not in a hurry give them a try.
0,"Weak donuts!  My 13 yr old son only took a few bites of his apple fritter before saying \""this is gross\"" & discarding it.  I got the donut holes & they were average at best.  Wouldn't go back, even for a free dozen."
1,"During the 1990s, when I lived in Montreal in my late teens/early 20s, I was a frequent visitor to Super Sexe and other Montreal strip clubs. Super Sexe was always clean and classy with hot women. It was always packed at any time of day or day of the week. I was very disappointed when I stepped in there in May 2011. It looks like the owners had not put any money into renovating it for the past 10 years. There were very few patrons, and the girls looked bored. They only had a girl dancing on stage every other song. After chatting with a stripper at Super Sexe's sister club, Super Contact, I learned that the weak economy and the weak US dollar has been keeping the tourists away and as a result keeping the strip clubs empty. It is really a shame. Some of best guys nights out ever happened here. I hope it recovers as the economy improves."
0,Bad service today. Two registers open. One cashier taking multiple orders from one customer. The other cashier let someone cut in front of me then decided she was done waiting on customers. With a line out the door there was no manager around. I left without ordering.
4,"Perfect stay. Desk staff, restaurant and spa staff are all amazing, really friendly, helpful and accommodating, and seem to genuinely want you to be happy. Delicious food at ZuZu. Pool scene is fun and happy, even in sweltering July heat. Complimentary Red Flower soap, lotion, bath gel, shampoo and conditioner are fantastic. Don't hesitate to book this place."
3,"When someone says \""buffet\"", usually the world of foodies dies a little inside, but I was surprised at how lovely this place was to eat. Me and my fiancee went here as part of a Groupon for a 2-course meal with rice/naan for 2 but after taking our seats the lady who I took to be either the owner of joint owner offered us the chance to try a little more and asked if we would like to take the buffet instead of the 2 courses. I thought I had went to heaven, as bad as the idea of a buffet is, I couldn't say no to unlimited Indian food.\n\nIf the manager is to be believed then everything in the restaurant is homemade, or at least made on the premises. The starters were delicious, the curries were magic, the naan breads were hot and soft and even the desert were lovely but not too sweet.\n\nThere is a part of me that feel reviewing a buffet is like reviewing a Tesco, but I was very surprised at how nice and intimate this place was. Service was great and the food was even better.\n\nAfter having a quick look at the a la carte, I will definitely be coming back to try that.\n\nI'm a self confessed buffet lover and no matter how many good restaurants I go to, I will never change in my need to get elbow deep in food once in a while."
2,"Its a very nice big store and good prices but their outside security is not so good mostly at night . Be careful when alone ,its dark and no security around if something goes on out there no one will hear or see if late . Bad bad lighting needs more light"
3,"Every time my husband tries to get me into an electronic store I immediately get nauseous and try to get out of it. We don't have Fry's in Hawaii so I hesitantly dragged myself into this store. I have been here before but I don't remember it and I normally block out electronic stores in my mind.\n\nAnyway, this place is huge. I walk in and think of something I need. Hmm...I need a reading light for my Kindle so I don't make my husband suffer as he tries to sleep. I have to say they have so many unnecessary but entertaining things to buy. The inner geek in me started looking at the toys and gadgets and all the other electronics, exercise equipment, and other odd things you would normally not find in an electronic store. I actually had an entertaining time in there and had to remind my husband of his nonexistent time limit. Husband was happy, I was happy, we are all happy. Fry's made a break through. It's the only electronic store I can bear with a time limit."
3,Best patio in town.  Only visited once so far.  Food above average and the menu has a good variety that goes beyond basic bar food. Service and the patio were A+.  The place just has a cool vibe to it.  Can't wait to go back.
1,"It was one of the worst chain BBQ place I have tried. The side dishes was better than their meats.  A little over priced for what you get as far as quality.  All the meats we ordered was over cooked and dry, had to drown the meat with the BBQ sauce to get it down. Tried Dave's BBQ twice now just to make sure, won't be going back for a third."
2,"Located in the shadow of the Stratosphere this place has good ol Vegas-style pizza-Cheap & Fast!\n\n!We ordered the FAMILY DINNER special w/1-2topping 18\""pizza,spaghetti,lasagna,salad and garlic bread plus a @L of Coke=$30!! Delivered in 30 minutes.\n\nPizza was good,lasagna too but spaghetti was nothing specialsalad was warm from being delivered in the same bag & the garlic bread wasnt toasted.\n\nStill a good value & pizza for breakfast the next day!!!"
4,Let me start off by saying that this is not my usual dentist and I drove my friend here for moral support while she was having a total crisis and dental emergency.  She hates going to the dentist so I went with her because so she was so anxious and in tremendous pain.   \n\nThis is her usual dentist and she said she is always happy w/ the cleanings and work she receives here.  She DID NOT want to go anywhere else for the emergency situation so It was a blessing they were able to accommodate her w/ such short notice.  I was very impressed that they got her in the same day. Dr. Catalano and a few staff stayed way beyond closing time to finish up which meant so much to my stressed out friend. They treated her like she was family and went above and beyond so late in the evening.\n\nState of the art...top of the line equipment and the latest technology.  I also learned that they have massage chairs and they are a paperless office--thumbs up for that!
4,"Visiting Charlotte for the National Parks and Rec Convention. Our hotel the Westin, suggested Midwood Smokehouse. Great recommendation, friendly service, great atmosphere and excellent food. Loved the creamed corn, BBQ beans and banana pudding and sweet potato fries. And of course great, BBQ meats."
2,"If I have written this review months ago, I'll give them 4 or 5 stars! But, we are on the first day after the changed their menu today, feeling sooooo upset because of their change of my favorite beef brisket with a new dish on the dinner menu! Beef brisket will be no longer served here in Great Dane! So sad, in the beginning of the year, they first took the steak off the menu, and now it's brisket's turn : ( I guess from now on, my only choice would be their burgers which cannot compared with Old Fashioned's! Sighhhhhhh"
1,Bland food. Got the #7 platter which is a fish taco and a mini burrito. The fish taco had no flavor and the mini burrito was sub par. The iced tea is from a machine and tasted awful! I poured it out and got the instant lemonade instead.
0,"This place has gone really down hill :(  I was in last weekend after a hockey on a saturday at 9pm.  The ladies bathroom was gross.  The service was lacking in friendliness and timeliness-and all we had was beer and appetizers!  We used to love coming here, but will definitely think twice."
1,"Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there."
1,The first time I experienced this buffet was in 2009... and probably then I would have given it 3-4 stars.. but now.. something happened.. and it's not as yummy..\n\nI felt like the quality of the place has kind of gone downhill from my previous experience.\n\nThe foods were typical buffet foods.. the desserts were typical buffet desserts... nothing that really makes it stand out.. nothing that really tastes great enough for me to keep coming back..\n\nAt least it was clean..
3,"I really enjoy Donato's. The food is terrific-love the pasta sauce and chocolate rubbed steak!! Great wine list!!!\n\nI've taken company, out of towners, etc. there. Really impressive!"
0,"I booked this hotel room hoping for a \""4 star experience\"" in Las Vegas. When we arrived in the room, it smelled like mold and smoke (even though it was categorized as NON smoking), the carpet was dirty, and the hotel receptionist wont move our rooms unless we paid an extra 40 dollars per night to \""upgrade\"" to a newly remodelled room. Being desperate for comfort and cleanliness, I went ahead and paid the extra 80 dollars to upgrade. I am writing this letter to communicate my disappointment to hotwire's online description of the hotel. I felt mislead and deceived from the hotel description. \nMoral: not all \""deals\"" from hotwire leads to a happy ending.\nBlah."
1,"I love total wine...just not this one.\n\nI shop for beer and occasionally shop for wine. I'm not sure if the stocking is broken up into sections by type of alcohol (spirits, wine, beer) but whoever orders the beer does a horrible job. I can always count on this Total Wine to NEVER have what I'm looking for. The shelves are almost always half full with gaps everywhere and signs saying it's out of stock. If I want a good selection, I drive to the one of Shea.\n\nFIRE the person who orders the beer! North Scottsdale can get it right, you should be able to as well."
1,I have been back here twice since my last visit and this place has really declined in food quality and service. \n\nThe delicious cinnamon roll that I had on  my first visit has since become cold and dry. The eggs benedict was covered in a flavorless and odd colored hollandaise sauce. Bacon was limp and lifeless and so were the employees.\n\nI have to say that I have no plans on returning here until they get their act together.
3,"I landed this place by luck! and am happy about it. They have great sandwiches, and many veggie options too. I tried gingembre sesame tofu and it was awesome!  The staff is pretty friendly too. The place is small but food is good and reasonably priced, also its 24hrs."
1,"Hubby and I make a trek to Vegas every summer to reconnect and just \""be\"", stayed at The Wynn in June 2010 for the first time.   STUNNING looks but lacking in service and security....check in took over an hour - we stood in 1 line and suddenly that line just closed leaving us and a few others ahead of us to go to the BACK of the line somewhere else. No explanation, nothing.  Just ridiculous.   The next day was our first visit to the pool.   Very nice,  but lots of unattended wild kids.   Yes it's a free country but these kids were just nuts, running all over the place, splashing right where we were sitting. Sorry, but if I had to hear screamimg kids yell \""MARCO...POLO\"" one more time I was going to lose it!  We eventually had enough and just left the pool.   On our way out I mentioned this to security (they have signs posted that children must be accompanied at all times).  The guy just shrugged and said they'd \""check into it\"" but he never left his seat.   Not to be bitchy but when I'm on vacay I don't want someone elses kids in my face constantly.   So we get back to our room and the security lock bar was turned to keep the door propped open so we were a little freaked but went inside and nothing appeared to be taken.  I honeslty think after reading reviews on this site at a few places about theft issues of peoples rooms bring broken into that the housekeeping did this to allow somene else to come in and rob our room but we came back from the pool too soon (guess I SHOULD thank those unruly kids for that one).... we immediately called down to security who came up to our room and because nothing was taken that we could see, was indifferent and acted as it it was no big deal.  He said he thinks housekeeping must have accidentally did that (seriously????) Why would security even do that, cmon'....   I called down to the front desk and explained what happened and asked to speak to the manager and was put on \""perma-hold\"" so eventually hung up,  I did eventually make contact with a manager (Tim I think) who was pretty indifferent about it as well. When something like that happens it sort of ruins your thoughts about a place regardless of anything else that may have been good.   Will we return there? Doubtful, we're headed back to Vegas in May 2011 and am staying at The Palazzo....."
1,For Asian food not do good.  Average at best and overpriced gor quality.   The menu isn't that great.   There are much better Asian restaurants on China town.
4,Delicious red velvet cupcake with chocolate ganache in the center- exactly what I was craving! Amazing icing and moist cake! Really nice server as well :)
2,"Most of the staff are friendly and helpful and the store offers a lot of different services, including key cutting, mailbox rentals, and photo-copying, though it is a very small shop.\n\nI have a mailbox here and fairly consistently get mail that's supposed to go to an adjacent box.  When I report it, they always say they'll ask the distributor to be more careful, but I can't say I've noticed much change.  I wonder how much mail of mine has gone to another box?\n\nThe main complaint I have relates to the cost of mail services.  GASP!!  Holy crap!!!  Be prepared to pay a premium.  They are overpriced, as also noted by several other reviewers.\n\nTIP: For US Postal Service in the same shopping center, visit the Hallmark Store to the west.  They store itself has the worst service ever (see my review), but they have an in-store postal branch outlet...at least for now.  That may change when the USPS goes belly-up..."
3,Man this place is pretty darn yummy. The ice cream here is so dense and creamy. I can't imagine having any size bigger than their smallest size. It definitely hits the spot during those hot AZ summer nights.
4,"BEST VEGAS BUFFET I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!\n\nThe decor is out of this world, and the food is even more stellar!\n\nThey portion everything out so you can try a little bit of everything and not over stuff yourself with just one item. They offer a variety of cuisines. Asian, american, italian, seafood, fresh fruit, dessert, etc.\n\nThe best eggs benedict at a buffet I have ever sunk my teeth into. Prime rib is a classic, and the best gelato flavor: THAI TEA. SOOOOO BOMB\n\nI will come back to this buffet because it is simply the best.\n\nI cant remember everything I ate, I just know I left the size of Violet after chewing the gum in willy wonka and the chocolate factory..\n\nMuch better than the buffet and planet hollywood and the bellagio.\n\nNOM NOM NOM!"
3,"Stopped by this food cart for a quick lunch to take back to my office. The beef brisket bbq sandwich was very, very good. The fresh-baked kaiser bun was not too chewy, not too tender, but just right to hold its precious meat cargo. The dry rub + sauce gives the meat a layered depth of flavor. The brisket was tender, with a really good meat flavor coming through and not overpowered by the \""spicy\"" sauce. Note: the spicy isn't really hot, just interesting and savory. I recommend it.\n\nThe broccoli raisin salad for the side was tasty, but next time I'd probably try something else."
0,Wife went there with her wedding party to get their hair and make-up done and had an absolutely dreadful experience. Staff was incredibly rude and incompetent.
4,"In love with this place! Just love the cocktails and the vibe it has. Moscow mule is sooo yummy! Service is always great. Make sure you make a reservation if you want a booth, they get pretty busy."
2,"Came in here after a four hour hike because I was craving a nice big salad. I ordered a house salad and a Chicken Cesar Warp. It was my first time ordering a wrap from a restaurant, it was pretty delicious I must say. The portions were nice sized and the service as decent. My one complaint is the deep fryer was down therefore I did not get to try their onion rings oh and the ranch could have been better. Other than that their prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back especially on a game night. They have really good foond and specials on game nights."
3,"Great hotel, stayed here for two nights with family.  Not kid friendly, no strollers allowed unless you are a guest and the \""elegant\"" dining restaurants don't accept children younger then 5.  We got a king suite for $149 a night with a $50 resort credit.  Since we can't dine at the nicer places, we chose the buffet, which was a nice surprise.  Paid $35 a person, charged to room to use the resort credit.  Ate one too many alaskan crab legs and felt sick.  I still haven't manage to control myself at buffets.  No matter how slow or how little I get, I always wound up overeating.  I think the liege waffle pushed me over.  Watched alot of tourists munch on the pizza ($35 for cheese pizza?).  Hotel was able to provide a crib for our 10 month old.  It is a smaller crib, not the normal full size.  If you have a big baby, he/she might feel claustrophobic.  The bumper seems dense and worried me a little but our little one is not that mobile yet.  Overall suite was very nice, we had a view of Circus Circus.  The morning coffee was a disappointment.  Their coffee bar is right near the elevators and was a tad expensive for the type of coffee you get.  Don't get the breakfast croissant sandwiches, oily and greasy, felt ripped off for paying $9 for that crap.  Definitely would've given 5 stars if not for the limited dining choices and the sucky breakfast sandwiches (the grilled breakfast sandwich at Jean Phillippe in Bellagio was excellent)."
2,"It's chilly here - so please where a jacket!  \n\nThe station is going under major refurbishment, so please bear with it.  \n\nIt has a ticket office, toilets and various shops to get any last minute shopping before you hop on that train. \n\nLooking forward to seeing the completion of works."
1,"EH, for all the waiting, and all the heat, and all the hype, and all the expense....this really wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Honestly? The Frozen Hot Chocolate just sounds cool. Go to Starbucks (or somewhere else that's cheaper) and get a Frappaccino for half the price and half the wait. In my opinion, this place is WAAAAYYYY overrated."
4,Great place to store my stuff I truly recommend this location friendly service too. Will tell all my family and friends about coming here if they need storage. Thanks Public Storage!
1,"Well, maybe we caught them on a very off night......but our experience was not very good. We had a Groupon to use for 2 pizzas and 2 Gelato and even for what we paid, I feel like I wasted money. First off, it takes the employee about 10 minutes to \""prep\"" your pizzas (which kind of seemed excessively long) then of course 90 seconds to bake it. The pizzas came out luke warm at best, the pizza and toppings were NOT hot like you would normally expect. The pizzas were soggy, droopy and just tasted doughy. I would say maybe another 90 seconds would fix the problem? Or maybe thats what they serve? Not sure, but I have eaten pizzas for over 30 years and I would have to say this pizza reminded me of Elementary School \""square pizza\""......droopy/soggy and just plain bad. Oh, well.....you win some and you lose some......"
1,"I don't have too much to say here, but I think the quality of the yogurt was a bit disappointing for me. Plus, the mixers and the yogurt stations were messy and didn't look very appetizing"
2,The line to check in is really long! Also we booked a king bed but got one queen bed! There was no hot water in the shower either. The location of this hotel is great though because it's in the middle of the strip so I liked that.
0,Waiter served me a cold meal left over from a party being held there.  Absolutely horrible experience.
3,"Margiotta is one of the few places that has caused me to foodgasm, but it's such a wonderful mix of staple groceries, as well as very exciting food, that I couldn't really hide by happiness!\n\nIt's very close to Scotmid in the Marchmont area, but aside from price, I would choose this one everytime. I was absolutely overwhelmed by all the great food they had; middle eastern snacks, an impressive variety of cheeses, fancy sweets and biscuits.. I'm a little sad I can't remember everything I saw! \n\nThey also sell fresh fruit and vegetables, and from the sign outside home made diary ice cream. It's like all my favourite stores crammed into one... Sighhhhhh..."
0,"Filth. If you like this stuff, you have the palette of a pig and you should be fed in a trough.\n\nThe standards met here are so incredibly low, it literally qualifies as \""I'm so hungry I'll eat anything\"". And at Primantis, that's what you get -- a sandwich that tastes and feels like it was dipped in a toilet before you got it. Just the thought is sickening.\n\nI've had drunk food in State College, Philadelphia, parts of Jersey, parts of North Carolina, Atlanta and Orlando and I've never had worse than Primanti Bros. They do nothing right."
1,"Goodness gracious...I needed some fro-yo and some hand picked toppings. Saw the Red Mango sign and damn...I was ready! \n\nNow, not all Red Mango's are not the same. I am use to my Red Mango where you get eight flavors to choose from, choose how much you want to put in your cup and pick your own toppings. No self serve here:( \n\nSo, I watched as the girl put more yogurt than I asked her to. I couldn't believe each topping was .75. I watched as she meticulously put each blackberry on one through six. Then she honored my request of mochi balls and dumped a spoonful on top. \n\n\nI guess I like the experience of getting exactly what I want, measuring it out myself, weighing it and paying for it. Yes, I know, I could have gone elsewhere but it's all good. \n\nRed Mango is some delicious fro-YO! Perfect stop to chill and cool off after being in the Vegas heat."
3,"Dinner here last night as part of a party of 11 was a really fun experience & the place is definitely worth your time and money if you're a fan of meat.\n\nHaving seating for only 25 or so overall there's an immediate intimacy between all the diners and the waiting staff, thereby quickly making you feel like a regular even on your first visit. The portion sizes are excellent (a starter may not be the best idea unless you've got a really large appetite) and the service consistently good-humoured and attentive.\n\nGiven the size of the steaks and the various skewered meat dishes it can take a bit of time between ordering and serving but at no time do you feel that this is due to anything other than the need to prepare each dish fresh. There's clearly good reason then for the need to order some group dishes 24 hours in advance.\n\nA very welcome expansion of the dining scene in Edinburgh."
1,I don't know why this place has 4 stars. The beer and pretzels were delicious. The fish fry was over cooked and blah. My salad was wilted. It's easy to find good beer. I can live without the pretzels. I won't be back.
3,"Looking down the row of dining options in Terminal 4, Blanco looked like our best choice. We were able to secure a table immediately and our waitress was quick to take our order. It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito. \n\nThe chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter. \n\nWe are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise."
3,"I like this buffet b/c it's HUGE!  OMG...I felt like I took a tour first before I got my food to eat.  For the price, it's a good place to go.  They have all sorts of food, especially meat.  Of course, everyone gets the snowcrab legs.  Dessert is yummy too especially the gelato (not too sweet and light on the taste).    The line wasn't long at 6 pm either on a weekend so no need to wait 45 mins to eat..go here!"
1,"Let me start this off by saying that I love q'doba, the food is delicious. Reason for 2 stars you ask? Well I'm currently standing in line, I'm the only one here. I was greeted with \""I'll be right with you\"" and then I waited while the two ladies here finished their conversation! So while the food is great, this experience was not!"
3,"The food is the star if the show here!  Don't get me wrong, the place has been remodeled and looks GREAT inside.  The dining area is totally separate from the bar so you can enjoy smoke free eating.  The ribs at $15.95 are a BARGAIN!  They have SO much meat on them.  You cannot and will not find better for the money ANYWHERE!  Not even Ellis Island.  You can't beat their quality and price.  For you cigar lovers, check out Doc's Cigar Lounge....On West Charleston, West of Valley View...Enjoy!"
1,"Am I in New Jersey?\n\nI'm not?\n\nAre you sure?\n\nI can't even see the strip from here, I don't believe you.\n\nThat guy has a fucking Ed Hardy tattoo. I'm definitely in Jersey right now."
0,"Sadly I would of never thought I would be giving Olive Garden a 1 star. \n\nFound out that my favorite event at OG was going on and since we hadn't yet been into our neighborhood OG since it was new, it was a easy choice. We arrived and and were seated immediately by the front entrance.\n\n Nikki was our waitress and we placed our orders. I ordered the Asaigo garlic alfredo on angle hair pasta and the chicken noki soup. After the normal wait time our salads and soups were brought to the table. I kind of laughed as there was only about 1/4 inch of soup in my bowl. All broth and 1 piece of gnocchi. I started to eat it and about 5 minutes later Nikki stopped by to check on us. I asked for another bowl of soup, and she stated,\"" I don't know why your filling up on soup when you ordered the endless pasta.\"" Well, I was embarrassed and just told her I like the soup. She leaves and brings back another bowl of soup and it is once again only has about 1/4 of a inch of soup in it with no gnocchi  at all. Just the broth! I asked Nikki why this was and she said she had to scrap the bottom of the pan to get that much and that they were waiting on someone to bring them more.  Now I know this is just me, but the manager stops over with a big smile wanting to know how we are doing. I told him that I was put off by Miss Nikki and what she said to me. How awkward I felt. He said he would get to the bottom of it. Now out comes Nikki bringing me a full bowl of soup and asks me in a condescending voice, \""is that enough gnocchi ?\"" WTF!!! I didn't even ask for that bowl! Now while she is there someone else brings out our food. So I have my pasta in front of me and I don't even touch the soup. \n\nI am disappointed in my service. I really did not enjoy my dining experience because of this particular person. I would much rather drive the extra 5-6 miles down to Cheyenne Rd and go to that OG. Because for the 7 years I have been going there I have had excellent service.\n\nI won't be back anytime soon, as we are fans of Michoacan and they KNOW how to provide a good meal with great service,and it's basically in the same parking lot we will go there if we want to stay close to home."
4,Great hot dog and chicken panini to-go!! Couldn't wait to write a review before I ate my chocolate-chocolate chip cookie.
1,"Pros:\n\nFood and presentation was great. I asked for spicy and it was just the right amount of spicy, nearing uncomfortable but still very comfortable.\n\nThe vibe in the restaurant was cool. It still felt like a Mom and pop, but not run down at all.\n\nCons:\n\n15% gratuity was added for a party of two, without forewarning. \n\nMiscommunication with the server led to purchasing $2 of rice after it was said to be included."
4,love this place love Sara
1,"If you like traditional Cirque shows, this is not for you. There is very little acrobatic or \""strong man\"" performance in this one. I absolutely expected the nudity and \""racy\"" script but I just didn't care for the shows' sense of humor or acts. Neither my husband or I found it terribly entertaining. Just a bummer that we expected more action like a typical Cirque de Soleil. = (\nBummer"
4,"Penn Ave Fish (Downtown) is one of my favorite places for lunch takeout.  And it's not a measly few orders.  It's usually around 20 orders including soups, specials, and sushi (all different)!  We call around 11:15a to place the order and they can usually have it ready within an hour.  And more times than not, the orders are perfectly prepared, not forgetting one soup!  \n\nWhen we pick up, the line is usually out the door, so I'm sure it isn't easy to get a large order correct during the prime time lunch rush.  Inside is small, but the chatter and blue iridescent tile d\u00e9cor give it a lively atmosphere.  \n\nThe Ronnie Roll is my favorite! Don't let the bright yellow soy wrap scare you!"
3,"This review will be short & sweet because you only need to know three words when you walk into Fiamma.  Traditional. Potato. Gnocchi.  Order it and you will not be sorry.  Loaded w/ Lobster, complimented with Cremini Mushrooms & Leeks, all in a Black Truffle Cream sauce.  It's absolutely divine."
3,I absolutely love this place.  Very large selection of very good cigars.  The drinks are fantastic and there is actually a very large selection.  I initially went to this place to purchase cigars as there are some only available at the shop.  My friend and I decided to grab a drink as well.  We got the tangerine mojitos and they were fantastic.  The eye candy at the place is also fantastic.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars really is that it can get incredibly cramped at the front tables.  The price of the drinks were fair for where and what they were.  However some of the cigars were on the bit pricey side which makes sense considering the availability of some of them.
4,"Yummy!!! Oishi!!! \n\nLove this place. Its not pretentious and the food is good. I wish the restaurant was bigger so I don't have to wait in line so long! (As well, a bit bigger so I don't feel like a freaking elephant when I try to squeeze by to get a seat).\n\nI like their shrimp burger and their salmon tartar bowl (and their salmon salad for that matter) was extremely tasty.\n\nDon't go there with children. Not enough room!"
3,friendly & helpful staff\n\nexcellent food & great presentation\n\npricy considering the types of ingredients that were used...\n\nyummy complimentary chocolate-covered fortune cookies were a hit...
4,"Came here to just try it out, but then their food just blew me away! The service is way better then Roberto's the workers actually serve with a smile! The drive through is really convenient. Awesome experience overall and I would defiantly come back again!"
4,I love this place. My family and I frequent it. I love the bibimbap and the kimchi fried rice. They have great sushi also!
4,"Edinburgh castle has got to be the number one must see attraction within Edinburgh.  Due to the location of the castle, high on an extinct volcanic hill, it overlooks the entire city.  Almost anywhere in the city you can gaze up and see the castle.  It looks amazing in the morning fog and even more spectacular in the afternoon sun.\n\nThis is probably one of the largest castle compounds which I have toured as well.  The castle is quite well maintained and you can get stunning pictures both outside the city walls and within.\n\nOnce inside the castle there is a free guided tour which will walk you through the outside explaining all of the things to see in the castle.  I have been twice and enjoyed this part of the castle tour each time.  I recommend walking with this guided tour (it lasts about a half hour) and then independently exploring the different areas.  The crown jewels, the chapel, the dungeons, the war memorial and the WWI memorial with the top of the black volcanic mountain poking through the floor are probably my most favorite areas to explore.\n\nOn nice days and probably the weekends, the ticket line can be quite long however you can order online in advance or order from the hop on, hop off bus tours and walk straight through.  This saved us some time on our second trip to Edinburgh as our first trip, I spent about a half hour waiting."
3,"The Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino was the second hotel I stayed in on my trip to Las Vegas. Having left the LVH pretty content, we were really just impressed overall! The wait time for check in was considerably less, the rooms between our group (3 rooms) were all great and all had great views. We actually felt spoilt moving from the LVH to Mandalay Bay. \n\nIn our room, my girlfriend and I had our own sink and mirror each on an elongated counter, with a small personal TV in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a separate bath and new, very clean shower cubicle. The room style and facilities were great, no problems and the room service had made it perfect. \n\nUnlike the LVH previously, the corridors didn't hum of smoke (in a no smoking area) and were really well decorated. The casino also didn't wreak of smoke, which quite a few do (coming from the UK, we're not really used to smoking in-doors anymore!). They actually may have sprayed some kind of almond/vanilla like scent/air freshner in the air-con?! Really pleasant.\n\nThe 4 days we stayed at the Mandalay Bay, we really enjoyed ourselves. A really great casino & hotel, classy and host of the great 'Michael Jackson - One' show! Thumbs up all round."
4,"Bungalow is simply amazing! My entire home was furnished by the very talented staff.. Alicia, Linda, and Jeff are so amazing! I recently stopped in and bought my fall wardrobe, including leggings, great t-shirts, and some beyond fab jewelry! The earrings I got are so beautiful, and people ask me everyday where I got them! One stop shop at Bungalow! Furniture, gifts, clothes, books, candles... You name it... It is all fab!!!"
1,While the food was of great quality and the staff were friendly. I take off 3 stars for the following reasons: \n\n1. Staff member observed leaving huge pile of ice mess on the floor after finishing transferring ice from the ice maker to the soda fountain ice bin. Staff member didn't bother cleaning up after herself! (ya mommy don't work there with you.. clean up your own mess!!). \n\n2. Buffet serving area didn't appear to been recently cleaned. Utensils felt sticky to the hand and floors not recently mopped (floors felt sticky as well.. including the restrooms). \n\n3. Been there 2 separate times and each time had to ask for silverware so I could eat my food! (make it a habit to bring the silverware out with the bowl or something!!).
1,"I want to enjoy Tutto Pasta.   I want to like that it is cramped, and old, and a bit scruffy.   I want to to praise Tutto Pasta because, and not merely in spite of its flaws. But I can't, because in my experience the food is marginal and the service is an afterthought.   \n\nMy wife and I dined at Tutto several days ago before heading to the Overture Center for a concert and we were both disappointed.   The pasta was fine.  The calamari was tasteless.    We were seated promptly (we made a reservation) but our waiter never asked us once about our food.  \n\nIn the age of \""awesome,\"" \""fine\"" food can be ok.   But that isn't even Tutto.   Too bad."
1,Got the buffet.  Decent selection.\n\nCrunchy French Toast...boring and under-seasoned.  \n\n$55 for 2 people is a little high for average breakfast.
3,"This is my \""go-to\"" spot. I normally order pho Bo vien large extra meatball and a large tsingtao. I like the larger sizes of meatballs they use and the broth is pretty delicious. This place is usually good on getting your pho to you in a timely manner, but the the same could be said with most pho places since it's not that difficult to prepare. I have yet to venture from my usual but when I do, I shall review it."
0,"Food was disappointing and ridiculously overpriced.  The whole restaurant reeked of charcoal/mesquite and not in a good way....we should have known the food was going to taste the same.  And it did. Awful.  I'm all for a burger grilled over hot coals, but when that is ALL you taste on a ridiculously overpriced burger with ala carte sides that you have to pay extra for and you leave smelling of burning mesquite, then that doesn't lend me to wanting to return.  And I won't.  The cheese on the burger was absolutely disgusting, a rubbery smoky nightmare.  Stay away from this place.  Not even service could save this place.  If Jasper's couldn't survive in this spot, this place doesn't even have a chance."
4,"Today I got the shrimp ravioli special and the boo got the Trio. It was delicious! \nSHRIMP RAVIOLI SPECIAL $16.99-a lot of sauce, two huge ravioli's stuffed with cheese and 3 large butterfly shrimps with tail still attached in a creamy sauce! I ate it ALL!!! Oh and a glass of moscato! \nTRIO $11.99- it came with eggplant parmigiana, lasagne and fettuccine. Out of those 3 the boyfriend enjoyed the fettuccine the most it hard a creamy sauce. \nGarlic bread was good and filling. Our waiter Tony was great he was a character! Made us feel comfortable and was at our table when we needed something instantly! We will def be coming back!\nOh I can't forget the $1.99 salad, the boyfriend actually got that and liked it he stated it got better at the bottom!"
0,"We decided to try O'Shay's on a Sunday and we felt like we walked into a scene from the show 'Bar Rescue'.  This place needed it!  The 'entertainment' consisted of a lone man screeching out tunes to his electronic music and drowning out any type of conversation and audio to the sports game playing at the time.  I saw one guy with his hands over his ears, it was that bad.  But it was his comments that literally floored me.  He stated that if we had beers and a tv at home, then we should leave to go watch the game there if we didn't enjoy his music.  He also stated that if someone wanted to pay him 20 bucks, he would stop playing.  Really?  I kept looking around for a hidden camera thinking a joke was being played on us.  Our waitress was very understanding and helpful, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to ever bring us back."
0,"Worst hotel ever for this \""level.\"" Upon check in the elevator door wouldn't close, after 4 attempts we used the stairs. We get to our room and the key doesn't work. The front desk gave us the wrong room key. It actually opened another room. Lucky we aren't thieves...\"" The TV did NOT work so we went without. There is nothing like crud in the corners of the bathroom floor from a lazy mop job over many weeks (obviously) for that kind of build up. Gross overall. \n\nIf you are looking for somewhere within walking distance to Chase Field, we did not find it threatening to walk in that area. Late at night, after a game, there are a lot of people and vehicles around. Those reasons are why it seemed OK for the area. I must say however in 104 degrees it is a lot more of a walk than you think. Had we known parking is cheap (under 10 bucks for some GREAT parking) we would have stayed FARTHER out at a Hilton..."
4,"Yep..I heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em.\nOf course the hubby had to try the grilled cheese and FF. They off the fries seasoned which is nice. His sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy.\nI had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes EVER!!\nThey come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream.\n1st the burrito..it was perfect. I had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. We both tore into it. It had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. We ate the whole thing.\nNow onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world...\nOne word: YUMMY!!!!!\nGo get some NOW!!! These are amazing. Then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them.\nI also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby!\nLOL\nIts a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. And it was on the other side of town. But I will drive here again  for THOSE pancakes.\nOh..service was also fantastic!"
3,"It's been a while since I have been on here, but just an update, Sammy's has redeemed themselves over and over these last two years. \nMy FIL got us started on there happy hour specials. My daughters LOVE their potstickers, and I love the chicken satay (but prefer to dip them in the potsticker sauce). My FIL raves about the duck tacos, husband loves the pizza (they have a great GF crust) \nAnd they have a sundae the size of your head."
0,Ridiculous way to run a business. TERRIBLE phone service (even the employees comment on how poor it is) with RIDICULOUS hold times (in excess of 15 minutes EVERY TIME). To see the SAME specialist for the SAME condition in a three week period requires going back to square one and getting yet another referral from the primary care doctor and then waiting ANOTHER SIX WEEKS before you get in to see the doctor again. There are too many health care options to settle for such ignorance and poor service. You're FIRED!
0,"I went to Sole on the weekend and found that it was so crowded and noisy I thought I would wait till later.  What better night to feed my paella hungrys than tonight when it rained cats and dogs - I was seated immediately and the noise level was bearable.  I ordered a house salad, paella Valenciana, thought I might have a dessert after.  I was served a very small roll with a small piece of very cold, hard butter and waited.  The salad was better than the standard peter rabbit variety of lettuce with a slice of tomato and was not ice cold, certainly a plus.  The paella came in a traditional paella dish with, I kid you not, three small clams, three muscles, a few pieces of squid, and a few shrimp.  The rice had little saffron flavor. The Sofrito  was extremely bland with little of the spices that one associates with this dish.  Basically Sole prepares this \""all at once\"" so the flavors have little or no chance to \""marry up\"" and the sea food being overcooked is rubbery. In other words you must \""reserve\"" the sea food and add it back in at the last moment.  As for the rice it should not be disturbed at the end of cooking so the socarrat (a crispy caramelized rice) can form in the bottom of the pan (See recipe below).  I think if you can buy canned paella and warm it up in a microwave it might be a close approximation of this abomination.  On the way out I was asked  about how I liked my meal.  When I proceeded to explain to him why I was so disappointed he ask first where I had eaten  paella and suggested that next time i should probably eat it some where else.  At no time was I rude to this person and I was frankly astonished at his attitude.  So to all you yelpers I suggest that you too might want to consider trying to find real Spanish food somewhere else.  For my friend at Sole I hope that even though he assures me that never in 8 years has he had a complaint about their  paella he will take the time next time to have the real thing at either of the fine restaurants that I have referenced in NYC.  He might also like to check out this recipe- noting the importance of the socarrat, the Sofrito, and the gradual \""building\"" of the paella\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-charro-espanol-new-york#query:spanish%20food\n\nThis restaurant is a treasure and has been  serving a very special crowd for over thirty years.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-new-york\nFor those who are not quiet as adventuresome as might be demanded by tiny little el Charro this is one of NY's best Spanish restaurants.\n\nhttp://www.paellapans.com/Paella-Recipe-Seafood-a/142.htm\nThis is close to the paella that I am accustomed to eating at el-Charro's -  note the emphasis on the proper forming of the Socarrat\n\nRegardless of all this.  Common courtesy is something that I expect from any restaurant.  This place comes up short on just about every thing."
1,Been twice. Bad service and very very average food....bummer as it's in my neighborhood.
3,First experience with Indian food and omgosh what an impression! Highly recommend!
0,"My parents had a 20 dollar off a 50 dollar purchase coupon and off we went.  Having just returned from Greece, maybe I'm being a food snob but this was not traditional Greek food.  My Mom seems to think they are under new ownership because she said the food was very different from the time before.\nWe enter an empty restaurant with fake and dried flower arrangements (a big pet peeve of mine).  We order Greek Salad and it is teeming with dressing and very little feta.  Our Kabobs reminded me of the Indian food I had the week before and accompanied with \""steamed\"" vegetables that look like the kind you buy from the frozen section of your local supermarket.  Pita is not fresh.  Portion size is good though due to the loads of basmati rice on the plate.  Decent amount of chicken for the money.  Service was attentive.  \nAn old Sting concert is blasting from the random flat screens located around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, while we were there we got caught in an unusual heavy rainstorm.  We were there long enough for the Sting concert to be over only for them to restart it and play it again.  I was trapped in my own personal hell!  Andes candies at the end wrapped up this \""Greek\"" experience."
2,"Egg Rolls were really good.  Sweet and Sour Chickent was meh.  We'll probably go again, but try something else."
0,"I have seen several shows here, and despite the over priced and weak drinks, nightmare security, and disgusting bathrooms, I come back because I like music and apparently no one bothers to check how bad a venues reviews are before deciding to play there. That being said, I attempted to attend a show there recently. My friend, that has a brain injury, was confused by security telling her she couldn't have gum. And a pen. GUM! I'm well aware of this anti-gum stance they have, but she was not. When she questioned the OVERLY THOROUGH security \""lady\"", she was denied entry, security claiming she was intoxicated. So, next day, I call to speak to the General Manager, Donnie Johnson. This man is horrendous. I was spoken to very condescendingly, and in a manner that gave me the impression he flat didn't believe me or CARE at all. When my friend called him, he literally shouted at her, told her it was her fault for not informing them in advance that she had a condition like that and that the marquee \""doesn't employ doctors as security\"". Then, he gave her \""to the count of three\"" to tell him what she wanted. She's not THREE YEARS OLD! When she didn't answer him quickly enough, he hung up on her. Great customer service here. I'll never go back. I have a lot of free time. I'll be voicing my opinion all over the internet."
4,I'm really surprised this Gamestop was not in Yelp. I stopped here for the Xbox One launch and was really impressed with this store. They were very organized and had a line with some staff out front explaining the launch. It went very smooth and I think everyone was happy with it.\n\nI came back about a month later to return a couple items that we also got as gifts for the holidays and they were very cool about it. I had my receipts so that made it simple but they were also really friendly and professional. Pretty cool and they know their gaming.
3,Harlow's is hands down my favorite breakfast joint in Tempe. Their portions are generous and always delicious. Definitely order a side of their biscuits if it doesn't come with your meal. They are Baked fresh and come out still steaming. Can't beat em!
3,"The hubs and I decided to try this place out on a particularly icky rainy Sunday afternoon. Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that. \n\nWe tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it. Well except for Chinese broccoli, but that's another post.). \n\nSo final opinion is that this is definitely the best burger joint we've seen in CLT so far, but it could use a few improvements like smaller buns for singles and a build your own burger option on the menu."
1,"It's mad busy here and donut was kind of whatevers.  If you're in a donut craze and desperate, then why not here?\n\nDrinks are expensive here.  If you want a soda or simple drink, go to McDonalds upstairs."
4,"I love Bassett!! \n\nThe menu is so versatile and has something for everyone. I've had the bur-roti, chilaquiles, and the spring break diet. All are super delicious. \n\nI also tried a couple bites of the chicken and a donut appetizer, which comes with a but of drizzled honey and siracha cream sauce. So Yum.\n\nThe decor is also really fun. His place has really grown in popularity lately, so pack your patience if you go for breakfast/brunch."
3,"I have been here several times and it always looks like a complete gong show inside: coats, people, scarves, plates and glasses everywhere, but the service is always impeccable and the beers on tap are always tasty and fresh. The little plates are nice and keep you from getting too loaded on some of the Belgian-esque 9.5%'ers.\n\nEasy to get to on the bus/Metro and even though it looks more packed than a Shriner's circus car, there's always room for more people!"
1,"I actually thought Ka was better than Mystere. Both plots are vague and you really have to watch to follow, but Ka was a bit less vague and actually showed progression through the characters, even if the audience was left to jump a few conclusions. \n\nThere was one part though that was just unbelievably ridiculous. They used some video game looking designs and we were basically watching action on a screen. Um, no. But other than that, some solo/duo scenes were breathtakingly beautiful, which is why I'll fork up two stars.\n\nFunny though, at the end, when the cast comes out,you'll notice that the majority of them is Asian (we folks are good at acrobatics, I guess?) LOL\n\nI excitedly paid around $170 for two tickets, with front and center seats, but I will definitely not be back to watch Ka again."
4,"How I heard about Bronze Cafe:\n\nThese very words were said to me many times during CrossFit class by a friend: \""YOU GOTTA GO TO BRONZE CAFE KEV, YOU GOTTA GO! YOU'RE AN ELITE YELPER RIGHT?!\""\n\nOoo! I am indeed a Yelper and you're calling me out! I never took the time to drive myself out of the way to eat at a little cafe, but one day the opportunity came when I had to make a visit to the adult Disneyland, the DMV. Yelp said it was 1.2 miles way? HUH... LETS GO!\n\nI normally don't write reviews on first visits, but it was good... really good... seriously really good. I had the Tree of Life sandwich ($9.95) to go which is VEGAN, but a bite of that gyro sandwich MASTERPIECE had me considered a vegan lifestyle for a quick second. I don't know why its called Tree of Life, maybe because you feel completely transformed, like a born again virgin. The sandwich consisted of something like pickled onions, roasted red peppers, avocados, greens, tomatoes, and MAGIC. \n\nSort of a tangent, but I took a bite of my TO GO sandwich in my car (bad habit) and was so amazed that I decided to eat the whole thing in my car, go back inside and grab a fork to finish the side salad, and was late for my class and quiz. Was it worth it? You bet. \n\nI am excited to come back and try the soup, salads, the BIZNESS, bars, pretty much everything. \n\nCHECK IN AND GET $1 OFF YOUR SANDWICH OR THE BIZNESS."
3,"We come here all of the time to eat and go to the movies and we finally had time to ourselves and booked a room for the night. Overall the hotel was great and we had no issues. We parked at valet, checked in easily and made our way to our room. You have to have your room key to use the room elevator so don't lose your key!\n\nThe room was spacious; we had a king bed. We were on the 10th floor and realized walking down our hall that our view was going to be the parking lot at Costco or the parking structure for the hotel. It was the latter. My husband only gives me the best.\n\nI didn't pack toothpaste  and they didn't have any in our bathroom so I called downstairs and they brought up 2 dental kits. Nice.\n\nI took a hot bath while watching the results to AGT. There was a tv above the faucet in the tub and the tv was actually pretty crappy. The remote didn't even work and I'm thinking maybe it's been dropped in the tub too many times? This tub was awesome though. It wasn't a roman tub but it was rectangular and super deep. I honestly floated in this thing.\n\nI used the gym once. It is on the ground floor where the spa is. There is a tv attached to every elliptical, bicycle, and treadmill. They offer ear buds for listening to the TVs but I declined. There were a lot of machines and a lot of weights. They provide towels and bottles of water at every machine and there is a side table full of cold water. I liked the gym. Now I need to go back and try the spa.\n\nWe ate at Hachi for dinner and the buffet for breakfast.\n\nWe had a really nice experience here and I can't wait to come back for another night or two!"
0,"Williamson Bikes is probably the worst bike store I have ever done business with (I do a lot of business with bike stores.)  I bought many bike parts and bikes from Williamson way back when they first opened, just off of Williamson Street, Del (the owner) in my opinion is as dishonest as the day is long.  He rips off customers, does dishonest \""repairs\"" and doesn't back up his service.  Glad to see this place close - fewer people will be ripped off by the highly arrogant owner."
3,Looks like Marie Calendars again... so glad!  missed the pies
4,Fav hotel in vegas!!!!  Every time i go there I feel like i'm being treated like a king.  \nThanks Palms Peeps!
3,"Your first time here WILL be awkward. It's like being in elementary school and the teacher throwing you up to the front of the class for an impromptu speech on your favorite classmate... so many classmates, so many friends! i'm dying of choices!!!\n\""Where is the menu?\"" is a good place to start.\nafter the initial awkwardness of having too many choices and not enough time to choose, you begin to really appreciate having so much control over the flavor that is going into your pie. everything from feta to mozzarella, artichokes to avocado, rosemary to basil, you can create your pizza like you create your salads. You choose your crust and your toppings and it's all baked to perfection. \ni used to work next-door to this delectable option of lunch-time fun. the staff was certainly very friendly and the owner even more personable.\non days like today, i miss it."
4,"I've been taking my dry cleaning here for the past few years and couldn't be happier.  They do good work, are fairly priced, and are nice people.  Glad to support this local business."
1,"Good service. Average food. Bad air conditioning to the point where it was steaming. Banana Nutella crepe had barely any Nutella, mostly just bananas and cream. The place has potential but they need to pick it up a notch."
2,"You should have some dessert here. I think ever since Fluff Ice came to Foodie Fest last year (velvety, perfect snow ice), this \""snow ice\"" caught on, but in lame and half-assed ways. You can get this stuff at Icy Juicy and Easy Life, but it just isn't the same. Not bad, but not the real deal. Anyway, having tried Kuma - I think they're the first in a wave of \""acceptable.\""\n\nFast service, rather tasty snow ice, and just enough toppings. I had the regular snow ice flavor with lychee, coconut, mochi, and strawberry syrup. I was a fan. I don't think it was too sweet, surprisingly, while being covered in sugar. This is a matter of opinion I suppose. I also sampled the taro, which tastes like taro. Surprise!\n\nIf you're a fan of this stuff already, you'll enjoy it enough because it's pretty much your only choice in reasonable distance. If you want the good stuff, you'll have to make the trip out to Frost Bites."
4,"I. LOVE. MACY'S.\nThis one is alright, not too snazzy but it has some good items!\nGreat deals in the clearance section!\nThe top floor is for kids, but take the escalator in the mall down to the bottom floor for the adult-wear.\nWoo!"
2,I haven't seen one of these in quite a while.  They still have great fresh bagels.
3,"I used to love love this place. Something is feeling a little off these days. I hope it's just not me. The sushis are as good as it gets. In my last visit, I got a toro (nigiri) and was quite disappointed. It was a thin slice of not so fresh toro for the same price that I paid for a fat piece of toro at an upscale place in DC. Really Chaya? Other than that, it is good. Highly recommend staying away from the \""fancy\"" rolls. Devote the space in your tummy for the simpler stuff. Chaya does that really really well. My Japanese friend is a fan of Chaya. That feedback means a lot!"
3,"Great attention!!! I'm not into expensive make up or much of facial painting, but had to buy a gift for a MAC Fan. The variety of colors adjust more the pale skin than mine. Anyway you can get to try and open all those pots and lip gloss tubes! Enjoy!"
1,"Meh. The food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive, but it was also boring. \n\nI'll never understand how so many Mexican restaurants can make refried beans bland.\n\nI've had much worse, but I've also had much better. It was worth a shot, but I probably won't be back."
2,"I've eaten at about 40-50 thai restaurants. Seriously...\n\nThis one is par. I totally love the Thai Taste in Spartanburg, SC. So, my expectations were a bit high. They aren't owned by the same guy although they are cousins.  The atmosphere is nicer than monsoon down the steet, but if you'd like better food. I would check out monsoon."
4,"Things are looking good at the Culinary Pharmacy, I have seen changes and they are good. \n\nFirst, the hours have changed and they are now open earlier and stay later, even on Saturdays. \n\nSecond, they have opened up a lot more windows and addded more staff to accomendate more volume. So no more long lines!\n\nI also love that they can dispense two months at a time, with call automation, I can call, leave my refill facts and can find my prescrpitions waiting for me within a reasonable time frame!\n\nNow, if we can work on their formulary, that is, the list of mefications they have available! I still have medications I have to go to Walgreens for, would love it if I didn't. It would be great to have a one stop shop! Hopeful, it will come!"
2,"Some dishes are good, some taste like they came out of a can from the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.\n\nThe heaven rice rolls might be my favorite in town, and the lobster dish is fantastic (definitely agree with kate - doesn't taste like lobster, but is delicious nonetheless).\n\nFree tea is always a really nice way to start a meal, too."
2,"Pretty decent pho place. Been here a couple times. Che ba mau (rainbow dessert) is crazy good, I asked the waitress and apparently it's homemade or they make it themselves so it's fresher. They put peanuts on the top and it makes it even more delicious. Any pho dishes are good, I usually order the pho tai, i like my raw meat! Service could be better, some of the waitresses don't look too happy to be there but the food makes up for the mediocre service"
3,"I have been going to All About You for a little over a year. Heather does my hair, and she does a fantastic job. I have zero complaints about the cut and color. She always does it just right!\nThis is a cute salon, which is in what I think was an old house at some point. There are a bunch of different (small) rooms, so you are never in a room with more than 1 or maybe 2 other people getting their hair done at a time. I find this very preferable over the regular salon line of 10 chairs. It's a much more private experience.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back; not at all snooty (like I've found some salons to be).  \nI know they have services other than hair (nails, massages), but I've never used those, so I can't comment.\nIf I had any complaints, it would be about 1) the parking; which sucks. They have a very small lot you can park in (if you're lucky - I've only gotten a space there early on a Saturday morning), but otherwise you are stuck with the street parking on Lombardy. And it is right across the street from Bad Daddy's (used to be Big Daddy's), so you are competing with those patrons, as well as people that live on that street, for parking. 2) the pricing; which seems a bit high to me ($160 for partial cut and color). Maybe my perspective is off, but that feels high to me. \nOverall, as far as hair care is concerned, I would give it 5 stars. I'm just giving it 4 because it breaks the (my) bank"
1,"The patio is beautiful, filled with plants , trees, and waterfalls everywhere. It's a relaxing environment.\nSo our waiter was freaking annoying and gave us the worst service ever. I mean we were sitting waiting to order for 15 minutes!!!! mind you that there were about 3 other tables at that time (12:30pm) He really sucked, forgot our drinks, our food came out like 50 minutes later, took him about 20 mins to give us the check, we spent like 2.25 hours eating!! It was soo annoying, his loss right?? I think we gave him about 4$ in tip. \n   The food however was ok. I got the chicken salad my cousin got pizza and the mango salad.  First off, they have amazing bread and butter, the bread is toasted and it already has butter on it!! yummm!\nMy chicken salad was ok, nothing special except it was expensive for the quantity that I got, about 16 bucks. The pizza had a crap load of cheese everywhere, eewww! Her mango salad, was kinda good but would of been better if the balsamic sauce had flavor. It was just plain vinegar and oil and they did not have any other type of dressing.\nI want to give 3  stars just for the decor, but horrible service ruined it! Bye bye aroma!"
1,"I visited tonight for the first time and ordered three rolls: a rainbow roll, volcano roll, and screaming orgasm.\n\nThey brought out the rainbow roll first.  It tasted great, super fresh, so I was looking forward to the rest of my rolls.\n\nThe volcano roll, on the other hand, was probably the worst version of the volcano roll I've ever had.  There were no scallops, which I'm used to having, the yum yum sauce tasted a little funny, and they unnecessarily added hot sauce.  I ended up scraping off the yum yum sauce and just having the baked salmon and the California roll.\n\nThe screaming orgasm was decent.  Again, the sauce didn't taste like what I'm used to, but it was definitely a better ending after the terrible volcano roll.\n\nService was okay, and the 50% off the entire menu was pretty good.  A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.  \n\nUnfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever come back to this place.  There are MUCH better alternatives all over town."
0,Service was terrible and the food was just OK.  The best thing about this place was the cheese crispi but not worth coming back for.
3,"Finally headed back to this restaurant after a long hiatus (they closed for a bit and I may have forgotten about them once they reopened, my bad for sure).  We were happy to see that the menu was a bit updated but it really was the same great place it was before.  \n\nWe have only been here for breakfast and it is always good.  The egg dishes are what I typically go for and I am rarely disappointed.  If you enjoy sweet breakfasts do try Merci's french toast.  It is different but different in a very good way.  Their coffee is great quality and honestly, sometimes I enjoy heading over to Merci just to enjoy a great cup of coffee along side a freshly baked croissant (or chocolate croissant...)."
2,"Not much has changed round Cameron toll since I was dodging about the place as a lad.\n\nMainstays such as BHS, Boots, WH Smith and the epic Sainsbury's are nailed to the ground, unlikely to go anywhere, and still my personal main draws.\n\nThen there are the collections of phone shops, travel agents and budget drug stores. In the way of diversity, there isn't much. A bookshop at one end, a couple of clothing stores I wouldn't venture into, and a Game store for the local geeks.\n\nIt pretty much covers all bases for what the locals might be in need of, so on that front it is fairly worthy. But not the kind of place you'd go out your way for."
4,"For the first time, I am giving a fast food spot 5 stars. Why?? Because they exceed expectations every single time. \nHands down best customer service of any fast food place, every staff member is super helpful and polite. Also ending everything with \""it's my pleasure.\"" Now I am sure they are trained to say it, but it also seems like they genuinely mean it. \nHow many other fast food places come around to your table if you are dining in, and ask if you need refills on your drinks. None that I can think of, except for something like Showmars, which I categorize slightly differently that your \""typical fast food'.\nFood is always hot and fresh, I have never had an order messed up, can't say that about any other fast food.\n\nSo the moral of this review is, in a fast food world, this is a 5 star experience. 5 stars like a steakhouse downtown, maybe not, but they have earned their 5 fast food stars for sure. \n\nThanks Chick-Fil-A!!\n\nNow you just have to open on Sundays!!! lol"
1,"Food is descent. Surprised by the salad options for a dog and sandwich establishment. The ordering process is a disaster. 5 points of sale with enough room for 3. This start your experience out very poorly and with mediocre food, the place is  worth the trouble."
2,"Excellent desserts and fries with good service\n\nI had never seen a Freddy's until moving to Phoenix.  Turns out that it's a nice add to the list of faster food options.\n\nWhile the burgers are good, they are indeed thin.  Compared to the big wad of food some places give you, it may even seem skimpy.  But, it's a welcomed change for those trying to not stuff themselves.\n\nThat said, our family is a fan of Freddy's dessert concretes/sundaes, chicken tenders, and fries .  Excellent on all, especially the PBC&C and Turtle concretes.\n\nA bit pricier that your MickeyD or B-King, but we like it better.  They at least commit to not pre-cooking everything.  And the service is usually much nicer."
0,"I recall when the first location opened on Craig rd., it was great and this became home for dinner, lunch and sometimes in the morning after a graveyard shift. Now the staff on Craig Rd acts like they do not want to be there and can be rude at times. It's not just me but I hear this around the area from others. I have since moved near the Centennial location and had the same experience. During my first visits I loved the place, staff and people were great. Now that management has changed a couple of times the place has gone downhill. I can really tell the difference since Bobbi was the manager here and now. Staff is slow and appears to be there just to collect a pay check; no one has a welcoming attitude. Yes they greet you when come in but it feels like they are greeting because that is the rule. My first sign of the decline was when I waited 40 minutes for an order of wings from the bar. I showed a manager the time stamp on my order receipt and all I got was a, \""oh okay,  I'm sorry\"" and he walked away. As of this past Thursday (July 9, 20130) I have decided to stop coming here. I ordered six wings, spinach dip, two beers and two scotches. I noticed on the other side of the bar a customer complaining to the manager and the bar tender making a drink near me with an attitude saying, \""whatever\"" and other employees coming in the bar area trying to see what was going on. That was really nothing compared to a couple of hours after I got home. My stomach was cramping all night and the next morning and I was running to take a crap every hour or two through the night. That was the last straw; a place I once loved has gone completely downhill. Now I understand why PT's down the street has all of the business."
1,"Me and my girls went here today for dinner after viewing a distillery. We carpooled but parking was almost non existent. We gambled by parking at the business next door. We were seated immediately. It was fairly hot and muggy inside even though there was a fan on. They need to get air conditioning. I was sweating buckets. The waitress was nice but she needed to speak up a little louder. It was pretty noisy inside with the music and other noise.  I ordered a bleu cheese burger, not the one offered on the menu that has bacon in it. I don't eat bacon. She accommodated me. I ordered a drink called the Peachy Keen because I had just come from the Arizona Distillery and Four Peaks uses their bourbon in that drink. I'm not going to lie here, the drink was not good to me because it had a strong beer taste and I don't like beer. They use their Peach ale in that drink and it overpowers the other flavors including the bourbon. Don't get it if you don't like the taste of beer. My burger, which came out as I ordered it (medium well) was delivered really fast. I don't know how you make a medium well burger that fast. Anyway, It was not juicy, it was not bad, it was not great, it was edible. My friends liked their food. One of my friends ordered a quesadilla and she said it was good. My other friend ordered nachos and it was huge. She ate some and took the rest home. Anyway, I don't like leaving bad reviews, but my experience was blah."
1,"My friends and I happened upon this place on the way to our hostel and, being from Southern California (and therefore having quite a bit of experience with Mexican food), we were so taken aback by a Mexican place in Scotland that we just had to try it. It's a fine attempt, but ultimately misses the mark. My blended margarita didn't taste good, and my beef tacos were a bit over-the-top. The food isn't bad if you're desperate, but I don't think I would go there again."
2,"My friend was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to wander into El Segundo Sol.  We really like the ambiance of this place.  The food was surprisingly better than we expected.  She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  \n\nMy pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  \n\nThe service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  \n\nHe was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, \""do you have everything you need right now?\"" often interrupting our conversation.  \n\nOn the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip."
0,"Ugggh.  That should be enough for this review but I'll explain a little more.  This place just sucks.  The food is mediocre and I'd rather eat taco bell for the price.  Why does everyone go gah gah over crappy texmex?  Oh it must be the margaritas, cause alcohol makes every taste perfect.  I will never waste another night trying to stomach this crap."
0,"I had been taking my two poodles here for grooming for a few years and was always happy with the service. Miriam would always groom at least one of them and was so good with my one dog who has arthritis in his hips and has sensitivity on his stomach area from being attacked and chewed up by a much larger dog.\n\nI will be honest and say that my dogs are not the easiest to groom.  The younger one likes to jump around the table and I guess Miriam said he does nip on occasion, which shocked me because I always tell people he wouldn't hurt a fly.  My other older poodle with the issues just needs to be picked up and handled properly and he is fine. With that being said, they have always been able to fully groom them and they have always left looking great. Miriam was always so happy to see them when they came in.\n\nRecently Miriam moved, so when my boys needed a grooming we just dropped them off with whoever was available. I dont know what happened but when my husband went to pick them up the groomer ( who was a young male, probably Miriams replacement) pretty much told off my husband saying that our dogs are \""bad dogs\"" and that they dont do \""bad dogs\"" there. He kept repeating over and over how our dogs are \""bad dogs.\""  My one poodle with all of the problems didn't even get his head groomed.  He left there looking the way he did when we brought him in. \n\nIn my opinion when you sign up to be a dog groomer you should be prepared to deal with difficult dogs.  I mean, what dog likes to be scrubbed down in a bath, shaved, paws and ears trimmed, nails clipped, etc?\n\nWe were never told by Miriam or any other groomer who did them that they were \""bad dogs.\"" I was highly offended by his attitude and lack of professionalism.  I am pretty sure this guy must have been new because I had never seen a male groomer there before.  I'm not sure if maybe he was not handling them properly or just did not have the patience, but I would have appreciated him handling the situation better. \n\nI am very disappointed and  will not be returning to Bone Appetit because of this incident."
1,"Ok, so I went to this place on Saturday night with a first date.  Its located inside the Tempe Market place sortof near the theatre section.\n\nSo, I get there, and its a late date.  Like 10:30 PM.  On a Saturday Night.  They had a few security people checking ID's, and after I did that and got my hand stamped, my date and I went and got seated.  The place was half empty!  There were people at the bar area, and a few seated throughout the rest of the resturant.\n\nSo, we sit down.  For some reason, service took forever here.  My date went to the bar and ordered drinks, but eventually the server came by and took it for us.  (he was waiting for a while at the bar.)\n\nI guess after a certain time they only have a limited menu.  So, we ordered our food.  He got a burger and fries, and I got this bread with stuff on top of it.  His burger looked delicious, and my bread looked appitizing and was tasty. \n\nAnother thing I disliked was that there was some kind of band playing here...and it was really really loud.  I mean, I personally am not a band critic, but it was really annoying, and loud, and I couldnt carry on a conversation or be heard.  So, not condisive to enjoying a dinner.\n\nAnyways, I cant say that I would reccomend this place, the food was okay, but the service was SO SLOW, and the music was super loud and annoying.  I dont plan on returning anytime soon."
1,Didn't open on time. The guys just stood there and looked at me as they smoked. Not cool IMO. They finally opened at 8:15 (15 minutes after they were supposed to). Fail.
2,"I love supporting small local businesses, especially if it's Hawaii based/influenced. \nI met a few friends here for lunch and everything was good. The location, service and food was all good but nothing special. I ordered combo plate with pork and 2 pc shrimp katsu that included miso soup, 2 pc daikon and rice (rice was mushy) and I paid for a small side of curry and it all came out to $20.(If I didn't order the curry it would have been around $18).\nPlease don't get me wrong....the food here was good just not worth the price. You can get chicken katsu that also includes miso soup, cucumber sunomono and salad for $8.50 at Soho down the street!! \n\nI say come here and eat to support locals from hawaii. But if you don't want to overpay then just go to \n1. Soho down the street and order Chicken Katsu (lunch menu only).\n2. Curry Zen (spring mtn)\n3. L&L Hawaiian BBQ :)"
1,"I've been to Hana Sushi about a half dozen times for lunch over the last two years.  The location is very close to where I work and live; I desperately want this place to be perfect, but sadly, it misses the mark.\n\nFirst, it's closed on Mondays, which is somewhat annoying, because I always seem to forget about that.  I've been there twice on a Monday and had to go somewhere else as a result.\n\nThe second problem is that when you go shortly after they open for lunch, they apparently have just started to prepare their rice for the day.  When you order a 2-piece on rice, we don't expect the rice to be warm!  It should be cold, or at least below room temperature.  The mixture of lukewarm rice and cold sushi in my mouth is not appetizing--and this happened every time I went.\n\nThe appetizer salad and creamy dressing was quite good, and the service was good as well.  If they could get over the warm rice thing, this could be a better place."
0,"I don't even want to give them 1 star, they deserve ( - ) stars if you ask me!!!\n\nMassage Envy is the worst company I have ever dealt with! Fist off my son bought me 3 massages from them for my Birthday. I used one of my massages on July 13, 2012 and they just called me to tell me my massages expire on August 11th because they were only good for 3 months, unless I sign up as a member! What's wrong with this? First, they were a gift and no one told me they would expire! Second, there is a law about gift certificates and gift cards not having expiration because it is the same thing as CASH, now I would think that this would fall under that same thing since it was a gift from my son. Let me find a lawyer and start a lawsuit and we will see who wins!\n\nDon't ever buy anyone you know a pacakage as a gift because they expire but, they don't tell you that!"
2,"The comedians which are pulled in are top notch and the food is stellar. The drinks came somewhat strong and pleasantly surprised me. The laughter was there but the room seemed extremely crowded, almost stuffed to the gills. The night was amazing until I finally got the bill; I PAID ALMOST AS MUCH FOR A DRINK AS I DID A BURGER W|FRIES!!! That is when I realized why they don't list pricing on the drink menu; the tickets might be cheap but don't let this deceive u, their pound of flesh is taken after u've been lubricated!! If ur willing to allow urself to be price gouged then ur in for some great comedy & an excellent meal. Otherwise, just redbox ur stand-up comedy and buy ur own booze, even top shelf is cheaper than Improv pricing; and seating is better too!!"
1,This is the 2nd time I've eaten here. The first time I came here I had the pick 2 combo whch was enchiladas.  the 2nd time I was here was on New Years Day after filling up on $1 beer in the sports book. \nI dont remember what my bf ordered but I went with Beef Fajitas. The plate came out sizzling hot and smelled very good. I dont really eat tortillas but it came with a side plate of rice and beans. the beans are kinda runny and the rice is very much like what you would get out of the box of rice-a -roni. Well I love san francisco as much as the next person but this was not my fave rice but after a few beers it wasnt too bad. \nThe fajitas were very small portioned. I know my bf took several stabs at my food but compared with other places I think I'd rather order something else next time. I guess I'm just so used to taking a box home to go- and this time .. there was no box to pack and it was rather greasy. \n\nBetter yet to go to Los compadres on Trop and order some fajita meat to cook up or order some of their ready made food.
4,Leah Joy is simplyamazing! The best blow outs and the best at hair coloring too!!
3,"I was here about two weeks ago and ordered the kids pulled pork. It comes with waffle frys and a drink. The sandwich was plenty big for a lunch.  You can also make yourself a ice cream cone when you are done. \n\nThe sauce is average to good but needed a kick, so I mixed the regular and the spicy. PERFECT. \n\n10/30/08 Update\n\n1pm and it was empty. There were 3 people in the place. \n\nI had the bbq brisket, kids meal. It is enought for lunch for an adult taht is for sure. The brisket seemed to be left over or waiting in some hot juice before serving. It was not bad but it was not great. I would prefer the Pork. \n\nLess then $5 with frys, drink and a pickle and ice cream....not a bad deal."
0,"Like any fast food place, the staff changes often. On a recent visit, husband walked out because he said the lettuce was brown and looked awful and the staff refused to provide fresh lettuce. Also, the turkey was so shredded, it was unrecognizable as such. The staff refused again to open a new chunk of turkey until the little nub left was used up. When my husband asked Iif maybe they could slice it thicker, the lady said she would charge extra! \n\nAdditionally, when I asked for extra onions, the man making my sandwich (who appeared to be the MANAGER) was rolling his eyes at other employees who were on a break in response to my request. I saw you do that you jerk; I'm not blind! Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!"
2,"Since my dogs are on a specialties food, its hard to find at most stores. Bonnies barkery offers the food, but its unfortunately higher priced than some other valley stores.\n\nI know that bonnies also supports the local dog rescue that I foster which is awesome. \n\nI think they also offer grooming, but I haven't taken my dogs here for that. \n\nAll in all I think they have a nice neighborhood pet specialty store but could lower the prices on the food."
3,"Ever since I heard about this place I couldn't wait to find it and try it!  It was worth the wait and the effort! We ordered two slices of White Pizza which was great! Thin, crisp crust that I could still fold slightly to eat like a taco.   \n\nThis Pizza was Garlicky and Cheesy! My two favorite things on Pizza, so I was in Heaven!  The only reason I can't give it 5 Stars is that my girlfriends PBR tasted horrible, like they need to clean their lines.  The place is very small, but there are a few Wheelchair  height spots at the counter.\n\nSecret Pizza will be a must stop on my Vegas trips!"
3,"always great stuff. I've been to better ones. But this one is pretty neat, good selection and excellent parking!"
0,"Time Warner Cable is awful.  I really recommend looking elsewhere for your cable/internet before choosing them.\nI have had nothing but issues with my cable and internet since I had them, which has been about 3 years.  My internet will be slow for no reason atleast once a week, my cable will freeze and I will have to restart my box...which is annoying when you are trying to watch tv.\n\nAlso, they really have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I recieved a bill from them a YEAR AND HALF after the fact for 35 bucks.  The best part is, I do not even have time warner in my name anymore....when I asked why I got this bill so late, they told me that since I moved they no longer had a \""bill to\"" address.\n\nhmm, very odd that no other companies had any issues with sending mail to my new address.  Its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone? Would that have been so difficult? I dont think so.\n\nI called them up to discuss his and ask them these questions and the person I spoke to was dumbfounded.  Yea, I would be to.....because it makes NO SENSE TO BILL SOMEONE A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE THE BILL IS WHEN IT IS SENT TO THEM A YEAR AND A HALF LATER.\n\nDo yourself a favor, take to look into another internet/cable provider.  It is not worth the hassel or the headache."
3,"I never have any complaints about this location whenever I come by. This is a recommended place to get pho if you're in the area. \n\nI hardly ever deviate from getting pho when I go to a pho place, but the few times I have had rice dishes here, I haven't been disappointed. I personally am a fan of broken rice because I like the small grains, I find them easier to chew and more enjoyable. The pork and chicken are cooked fairly well with a good amount of flavor in each bite. The pho itself is nothing too out of the ordinary. The noodles are good, the meat is good, the broth is good, what more do you want?\n\nThe restaurant itself feels very clean and orderly. Like at Pho So 1, the food there is good as well, but everything always feels so disorderly and it just feels like it could be a bit cleaner, Jenni Pho doesn't have that problem. \n\nI'm not loyal to any pho place in Las Vegas, but Jenni Pho is definitely added to the pool of pho places in the city."
3,"It's been a while since I took part in the nightlife in Scottsdale, it's not my scene but I was invited to White House for a party so you know how that goes.\n\nI arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  The crowd was sparse but I didn't care because that meant that I would get my drinks quickly.  The d\u00e9cor was minimal, everything was white and it seemed very well lit for a nightclub... less chances of ending your night with coyote ugly at this establishment.   There wasn't a cover charge and the drinks were... well I can't say if they were pricey because they were being paid for, but I can attest to their deliciousness.   I never had to wait in line for the bathrooms which were seemingly clean and also provided a bathroom attendant to hand you a towel... no toiletries though.  The staff was great, really cute bartenders that like to flirt.  The DJ was also a charmer and introduced himself to me.  He was playing a so/so music which basically consisted of top 40.  I can't really blame him though, I think it's a pretty common recipe to try to get people on the floor, which, by the way, was lifeless at this point but that didn't stop me, I grabbed a friend and danced the night away.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to any other Scottsdale skeptics."
0,"this club is only full because marquee is too hard to get into...\n\nwe decided to check out this place because some promoter talked us into going... hmm... shoulda known... but at least he was nice?\n\n1 star for:\n- mean hostess... if you hate your job, why are you there? plus, your club is like second tier, so you should be nice to us girls who are coming in... cuz you need us to bring the boys...\n\n- drinks are extra expensive... $60 dollar for 4 small shots; $8 for a bottle of water... i guess it's justified if the scene deserves it... but it doesnt...\n\n- the place is relatively small... and no where to sit unless you have a table\n\nspend your money elsewhere"
2,this airport confuses me when i get off the plane in vegas. i always forget that i have to take the tram to get to the baggage claim area / out the airport. i like how it is so easy to find the restroom right when i get off the plane. LOL\n\ni like how this airport has some last minute gambling or start your gambling right when you land into vegas. i remember one time my friend and i were stuck at the airport due to a delayed in our flight -- we were at the slot machines to pass by time. \n\nyou have to remember that there are 2 exits -- the exit closest to the baggage claim is where the shuttle is. and the exist away from the baggage claim is where the taxi line is. i was so lost and confused when i step out the airport looking for a taxi. i exited to the shuttle area and had to walk back into the airport to the taxi area. Getting a taxi was super easy. There is a a line and the line moves pretty quick since every taxi is waiting for business. \n\ni hate how the gates to my flight was so far away from the security area. it was seriously a 10 min walk!
0,"I was a long time and loyal customer after I moved to Vegas 2 1/2 years ago and I went to this restaurant numerous times until when I start seem HUGE cockroaches. First time was my ex boyfriend came to visit so I intent to gave him a better impression after he dumped me so we sat at the sushi bar then he pointed at the wall and show me the HUGE cockroaches walking on the wall slowly across the bar, I was so stun but since I was such a LOYAL customer, I did not mentioned to the owner. I mentioned to the owner next time when I was there then the owner just looked at me for couple minutes and saying if NEXT TIME if I happen to see again, he will give me 10% off. WHAT?  NEXT TIME? he forgot how many times I already been there after all these 2 1/2 years? I mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond. I decide not to go this restaurant anymore. 1 month ago, I brought one of my new friend there for lunch then we saw the cockroaches again. I mentioned to the server that the reason I stop coming here because the cockroaches and now here's again and the owner's attitude. She did not do anything either. Couple days ago, I went to the restaurant tried to order the lunch special and I got there at 5PM sharp and the owner was calculating the total bill for the others and not even look me for a second, after couple minutes passed, he said the lunch was over at 5PM but I got there at 5PM, he did not even look at me. \n\nI swear in my life that I would NEVER going to step into this restaurant again after I waste my life at here for more then 2 years. Isn't the customer service most important for the Japanese restaurant?\n\nIt's a pricy place and noisy and crowed place, just not sure why so many people go there for? You won't have a quality time for easily paying over $80+ for 2 people. The moist important is there's no SERVICE at all. The owner's attitude is even worth to hell. Don't get me wrong, I already ordered lunch special for over 50 times and their food has no problem at all but the owner is that kind of person since he sees so many customer coming up to the store, he forgot what's called SERVICE and APPRECIATION. He's taking for granted especially for a long term customer. \n\nNot only this restaurant is dirty, noisy and crowed and you have to wait for at least 1 hour in the night and also you will for sure join the dinner with the other insects if you are still want to go. Good luck for the people who still going.\n\nI am terribly upset right now when I am writing this post. I wish I had never spend that much money & time to this restaurant in my life."
2,"As with the previous review I'll agree that this place is hit or miss. I used to work at a restaurant nearby and bought fruit here for drinks and dessert garnishes, I always had to be careful what I picked.\n\nHowever, it is cheap, has a good variety of fruit and veg and all the staff have good chat so I say give this place a go and make sure you keep your eyes open when your choosing!"
2,"This hotel is what it is. It appears to have been studio apartments. It's kept OK. It's not new. It was very functional, not quite a mile off the strip and reasonably priced.  It was simply OK.  \n\nWe didn't appreciate opening the door and finding a scorpion in the light fixture, but they moved us rooms and we never saw another bug."
4,"This was a Fantastic lunch experience.  Recommended by a local friend and he did not let us down.  We arrived early for lunch, but by Noon the place was packed.\n\nGreat BBQ, lots of choices, and the fried green tomatoes were excellent."
4,"So happy that this place was around the corner from where I was staying this past week. I know that LA has a million coffee shops, but there was something special about GreaterThanCoffee! No pretentious baristas, just super friendly service! Never a line, either! The Toddy was delicious as were the bagels. If I lived in Phoenix, I would definitely come to this place every day. Super curious about Co-hoots, the connecting coworking space."
3,I really like rubios. It tastes great and seems fresh.
1,"Very Trendy hotel!!!  \n\nA friend was able to get me a free room for my birthday!   Thanks KJ!  :-)\n\nThe check in process was LONG-even in VIP, however I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free...\n\nThe room was cute and clean.   I enjoyed the views from the wraparound terrace.\n\nRoom service was GREAT!!!  \n\nI asked the bartender at the vesper bar  to  Surprise me with a drink that was fruity yet would still give me a buzz, she hooked me up with a SAGE 75!!!   Let's just say I enjoyed it to the fullest!!!  \n\nShopping in the hotel  left something to be desired.   \n\nI don't think I'll stay here again, however it was nice to experience it -  especially since it was free!  ;-)"
1,"Cool place, good food, horrible service. I want to like this place but the staff is cold and inconsiderate. Makes you feel like they are doing you a favor by letting you eat here. If service is important,  go somewhere else."
1,"Beware of this place,  great service, loved the decor.  I was there about 2 weeks ago and I sat at a nice table with my girlfriend. We shared  a calamari appetizer and then the tortellini pasta.  We dont drink alcohol so it was only around $50.  Everything was nice until we headed back to our room at the Bellagio.  Where we spent the rest of the night taking turns hugging the toilet.  The worst case of Food Poisoning I have ever had.  I did call and notify the restaurant and they said they will take care of it???  Ok great,   what a drag.  I didnt ask for my money back,  just trying to save anyone else from ruining their Vegas trip.  They have a record of the incident if yelp decides to filter this."
3,"Enjoyed fries served with 3 different dips, fresh apple/pecan salad, as well as most delicious scallops and truffle mac n cheese!  Hubby loved his steak!  Our server, Glen, was very attentive, friendly and fast!  Busy place, will return."
4,"even though i live roughly 15-20 minutes from this store, i still make it a weekly habit to come here for groceries. \n\nthe breakdown: \n\nsushi. their selection of rolls and sashimi are awesome! i love that i can buy a brick sized piece of salmon sashimi to take home and slice up myself. while i do love aj's sushi bar as well, whole foods definitely has them beat. \n\njuice bar. whenever i come in to do my shopping, i always head straight to the juice bar for one of their delicious fresh drinks. every juice mix i've tried has been fantastic, even if the fruit/veggie combo sounded like it might not work together.\n\nproduce. really terrific selection of fruits and vegetables. i especially love their huge variety of pre-cut produce; it makes cooking super convenient!\n\nin addition to carrying a lot of great companies that i can't get at any other local stores, their stuff is generally totally affordable.  a grocery store with a unique selection can mean higher prices (aj's), but i usually leave whole foods feeling pretty pleased with what i ended up spending. \n\nps. i'm super pumped for the new store that's opening on camelback next month! now i'll have a store within a mile of my house!"
1,"I was pretty disappointed with this place.  We went Thursday night for dinner and were really ready for this amazing dinner and a few items were really good, but much of it was so lacking that overall we weren't impressed.\n\nGood things:\nService was great - very friendly people and drinks refilled constantly.\nLots to pick from\nDessert - wow!!! their new york cheesecake and creme brulee was devine!\nLobster mac & cheese - delicious\nLobster bisque & clam chowder - both were really good\n\nBiggest complaints: \nthere were NO lobster tails - Not sure if they only put them out on certain nights, but bummed that there weren't any when we were there, yet other yelp reviews have people raving about them.  The only actual 'lobster' that was out was what they called a lobster medley with small pieces of lobster in the shell.  These tasted ok, but were supposed to be warm, but were barely lukewarm, making it a bit odd.\n\ncrab legs weren't good. they were cold, which was fine, but seemed as if they'd been soaked in water for a long time so the crab itself was completely mushy.  I've had better crab at red lobster if that's any indication\n\nIn the end, not somewhere I'll ever visit again.  Totally not worth the money they charge for it. Other buffets are better and cheaper."
2,"If you're planning to party during the festival, you're going to need to a list of cafes where you can refuel the next day, right?\n\nA short stroll from the Royal Mile, Le Cafe Royal is a neighbourhood greasy spoon where you can get all day breakfast, brunch and light snacks. There's various sandwiches, salads and snacks but the best thing to keep your hangover at bay is one of their Full English, Scottish or Veggie Breakfasts. The first two come with haggis and black pudding and the latter with egg, beans, tomatoes, veggie sausage and hot buttered toast. Tea and coffee are extra and whilst they taste like they've been brewed from a boiler, they usually do the job after a night of multiple vodkas and dancing on tables. :-)"
0,"After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years, I have finally decided that the price has just lost any relation to portions/quality and will not be dining there anytime in the near future.\n\nGradually, over the past year, the prices have continued to increase to the point of being dinner menu prices for lunch size meals.  Recently, the portion size has significantly diminished, to the point of being almost comical today.\n\nThe fish \""special\"" today was BBQ salmon with asparagus.  It consisted of about 3oz of salmon and four spears of asparagus.  It actually looked ridiculous on the plate.  The specials used to have 5-6 oz of fish, included a decent portion of vegetables, and rice, all for a dollar or two less.  While a bit more than I wanted to spend for lunch, at least the quality and size of portion made some sense.  Today, I spent $15 plus tax and tip and left feeling like I had eaten an appetizer and still hungry.\n\nThey have pushed it too far, I am no longer willing to waste my money at Atria's.  Too bad, we used to really enjoy lunch there."
2,"Some people love this place, but I don't really get it.  The whole thing about George Street clubs (especially Opal Lounge) being full of ex-Etonians in their coat tails and top hats is just a fallacy and it generally attracts normal people looking for a good night.\nMy problem with Opal is that the dancefloor just feels wrong! It's difficult to describe but it's almost got a garden shed sort of feel.  The floor is sticky as hell and there's always broken glass all over it.  Everyone just seems so dour and moody as soon as they get on the Opal dancefloor as well for some reason!\nOther than that the drinks are usually well priced and the staff are quick at zapping the queues.  I've never had an outstanding night here, but I know plenty who have."
4,"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant here in Vegas. Great prices and service is really quick. Food is tasty as well. And most of all, 24 hours!!"
4,"excellent work from start to finish!  (which was only one day for the entire remove-and-replace of my 1200sf ranch)  ...we had previously been burned by a disreputable roofing company, but tyler was consistently patient and understanding through my many questions, and helped me work through hiccups with insurance payment(s) long after the work had been completed.\nthe crew was efficient and deliberate in their methods, and they left the jobsite almost exactly as they had arrived (except, of course, for the beautiful new roof).  tyler was always available to answer questions about the project before they got underway, as well as after completion.\nfinding a roofer can be a daunting task, but i would strongly recommend you allow johnson roofing to take a look at your project and find out, first hand, just how easy roof replacement can be..."
4,"I just got back from dinner w/ my mom and sister.  We took our time, sampling several items from the menu.  We loved this place.  5 stars on Yelp was our consensus.  Mom felt it was one of the better restaurant experiences she has had in some time.\n\nWe started w/ an appetizer platter of spring and fresh rolls, and shrimp bruscetta.  After that we split a bowl of the Chicken, ginger and rice porridge.  YUM.  Next time I'm sick, I'm stopping in to get some for takeout.\n\nWe ordered #23 (beef, shrimp vermicelli), #28 (lemongrass chicken)  and #39 (vegetable yellow curry) for our meals and could not pick a favorite.  They were all very good.\n\nFor dessert, the owner recommended the banana pudding w/ tapioca. and coconut milk.  I will be getting this too the next time I'm sick to go w/ my chicken/ginger soup.\n\nWe will definitely be back to try other items.  I got the pho ga to go for my daughter and she gave it a thumbs up.  The owner noted we did not really eat the rice that came with our dishes and told us next time we are in to ask for veggies on the side instead.\n\nThe average dinner menu price seems to be $8-$9."
2,"The broth is the most essential part of the pho and their broth compared to other pho restaurants I have been to is nothing special, if anything the broth is a little on the sweeter side.\n\nMy primary place of choice for pho in Phoneix is KHAI HOAN in Tempe, due to its proximity to where I live (I go to ASU) and the quality of their broth (yummm). \n\nBut Khai Hoan is closed on Mondays, and unfortunately I suffering from the flu and was absolutely in need of pho. Doing a quick yelp search led me to this high rated restaurant. \n\nThe ambiance inside the restaurant and the plating of the food is amazing, which gave me high expectations of what was to come. The spring rolls are mediocre and the peanut sauce was not to my preference, it was too thick and did not melt around the spring rolls when dipped. \n\nThe tendons in the pho was undercooked and had a rubbery, chewy consistency as opposed to that \""melt in your mouth\"" consistency at khai hoan and other pho places. \n\nTheir broth is not as rich as others, you can definitely taste the difference. The spring rolls albeit look amazing unfortunately do not taste that way. The cuts of meet were also too thick and not thinly sliced."
3,"It was pretty good. We had the calamari which was excellent. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, it was good."
0,Went there the other night to watch the Yankees-Angels playoff game. Sat at an open small table. It was like I was invisible. I waited 15 minutes with people constantly flying by until a waiter actually made eye contact. Ordered a beer and waited another fifteen minutes for a menu... still no beer. It wasn't until I expressed my disatisfaction with the waiter that I finally received my beer. THE PLACE WAS NOT THAT BUSY. Tried to get my bill after my beer and lousy artichoke dip and finally gave up leaving a $10 bill on the table.
3,"Great service, delicious noodles, and a fun atmosphere. The servers were very attentive and personable, and watching the cooks make the noodles was fun."
4,"This is a great place for dine-in, delivery, or take-out Chinese food! The restaurant itself is clean, casual, and provides a comfortable environment to hang and eat for however long. The prices are reasonable and portions are generous.\n\nMy favorite is their Szechuan garlic chicken extra spicy with white rice. They provide plenty of meat so that you're not fishing through too many veggies to find it. The chicken fried rice is also good because it isn't too greasy. I'm normally not a big fan of fried rice but I enjoyed the one here. I also recommend their wonton soup... hearty and comes with quality wontons (not the yellow, Americanized kinds), and the broth isn't too salty like most other places.\n\nStaff is friendly and helpful... (we all know this is not the case for most Chinese restaurants). They're also lenient with menu modifications so if you like your dish extra spicy or enjoy baby corn the way I do, they will not have a problem making these adjustments. :) Overall I definitely recommend this place for a meal that's quick, cheap, filling, and enjoyable."
4,This is a great place for all. Tuesdays--prime rib for $1 per ounce!  Also their shrimp and grits are out of this world.
4,"I have lived here in Phoenix for 9 months now and have had a tough time finding a hair salon as I have thick, curly hair. I have been buying groupons for many places trying them out and none have worked. I bought the groupon for The Green Room to try it out and am absolutely in love with them! \n\nSteph was my stylist and she was amazing! I came in with a specific color I wanted as I will be leaving for two out of town weddings this month and she consulted the owner to make sure I got the right color. They would not let me leave until my color was perfect (my cut was amazing as well)! Eric (the owner) even took time to blow dry my hair after Stephanie's next client came.\n\nI will definitely be going back in the future for cuts and colors. The place was cute and cozy and the staff was super friendly. They definitely made me feel like they cared about me and what I wanted where the other salons just put a color on and let me go. So glad I found them and have found my new salon!"
1,"Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water, there's a lot of good things going on in the ingredients...In theory, this should've resulted in a bold flavor taste explosion, but I found myself severely let down by all of the bland ingredients piled high in front of me.  The pastrami was terrible, the coleslaw weak, and the fries were bland, dry, and flavorless.  Still bummed, my guess is that this place I more of a tourist draw now than a legit sandwich shop."
1,"Ive only been to this place a handful of times, and I think tonight will be my last. The first few times we ate there I thought it was pretty good, but more recently I cant say the same. The food is fairly tasteless, the beans taste like they are out of a Rosarita can, and the rice could pass for TV dinner. Im not sure if this place is going down hill or what, but it was a little pricey for what we got. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, a shredded beef chimichanga that came with beans and rice and a small soda, it came to $22 and some change. Chips and salsa are complimentary. Call me cheap but I can think of many other places where I could spend that $22 that wouldnt leave me walking away feeling like I overpaid for not so great food. \n\nI will say the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish for that reason I could give a better review but the food just doesnt quite cut it."
1,"This place was clean and the guy working the counter was friendly. The Philly sandwiches were ho-hum.  Nothing exciting at all. Rather disappointing really.  The soda dispenser is out of order so we had to drink sodas from cans...another let down.  The prices seem a little steep... lunch for me and my two kids was well over $30.  Then some guy came in talking business with the counter guy (I think he's the owner) and I got to listen to the owner complain about his margins... Really, I just paid $11.50 for a bland sandwich and now you're bitching about your profit margin while I eat it, washed down with a canned soda?  Not impressed."
3,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor."
1,"Ok, I'll start by saying this hotel isn't horrible. But it is not at all nice. It smells powerfully from fresheners, which means they are covering some not good stuff. Yikes! It's also pretty smokey.\nVery, very dated. Seriously 70s/80s fabulous, for better or for worse.\nOur bathtub was squishy--yes squishy from it not being sealed properly and water draining underneath it.\nPeople working were pretty nice, but some were grumpy toward us.\nThe conference area wasn't good. Some rooms were saunas and others ice boxes. There was no internet connection as promised in many areas.  The hallways were hard to walk down. Technology help was sparse and slow. Technology capabilities left much to be desired.\nWe wouldn't ever stay here again if we came to Vegas. It's far from the strip and a bit gross and very dated. I constantly felt like I needed to wash my hands."
0,"Okay, so this is the second year I've gone to Foodie Fest.  Last year we went on a Friday night, this year on Saturday at 6:30.  The line to get it wasn't bad when we arrived, but our friends came 15 min. later and the line was down the street and around the corner. I'll mention the entrance fee in a min.\n\nThe variety of food trucks appeared extensive, however by 6:30 over half were closing up shop and White Castle - oh White Castle...this is the main reason the huz and I decided to go.  A sign greeted us at the entrance that stated they would no longer be serving.  We went in anyway, saw that they were still cooking and people were sitting around - we soon realized that was the 4 HOUR wait - they gave people chairs!  We decided to grab a beer, however almost all was gone, our choices were Miller Light, wine or water!  It seemed so pointless, so I called my friends who were still standing in line and told them not to waste money getting in and we met up for dinner elsewhere.  \n\nWhat's appalling to me is the fact that when we left around 7:00, the line was unbelievable and any food trucks still serving had lines and wait times I had no patience for.  I wanted to have a megaphone and let the people waiting in line know that it was a waste, but I refrained.  I can't believe they continued to accept people's money ($10 at that - $8 for military) without letting them know what to expect.  All I kept saying is that I felt ripped off $28 down the drain in 30 min. or less and we were still hungry!  \n\nThe event, in my opinion, was poorly run, poorly organized and the staff seemed a bit clueless (texting, calling & not paying attention).  I feel sorry for the folks who continued to wait in line. I doubt we will return to this event, I'd rather continue our trips down to First Friday (Downtown) and Vegas StrEATs (at El Cortez). MUCH better and most of the trucks are at these locations anyway.  \n\nBoo."
2,"***TIPS***\n\n- This is the closest location to the main vegas strip\n- Don't come between 10pm to midnight, you might have to wait 30 minutes for your food. Its faster to do drive through during these hours.\n- Go after midnight if eating there."
0,"they are the worst car detailer in town,  they burned my paint and caused swirls in paint like crazy..  i will never use them again..."
3,"Wow, what a yummy dinner! For the Yelp ISC UYE this month our fearless leaders Ursula and Monica selected Caf\u00e9 Ga Hyang and what a great choice it was. I decided to be brave and order the octopus with noodles however our waitress (who I deducted from her brazen attitude is also the proprietor) talked me into the squid instead (sans noodles). The squid turned out to be a great choice since it was delicious! It was pretty spicy but not so much that it made your mouth hurt. Just some good heat and fantastic flavor. My hubby and mom accompanied me and to my surprise they both enjoyed their meals from the bbq section of the menu. Hubby got the spare ribs and Mom got the shrimp. Those two plates were not spicy but had really good flavor as well. In addition we all got white rice and all the usual Banchan (side dishes) including Kimchi. I did not sample all of them since it was just a ton of food but my favorite was the tofu dish.\n\nThe three of us agreed that the best thing we ate that night was the appetizer I ordered. Unfortunately I forgot the name but it was basically a plate of small, round, shrimp dumplings. The description in the menu said they were fried but they weren't super greasy or breaded or anything so I think they mean pan fried and not deep fried. They had the sweetest tasting shrimp in them and the wrapper just tasted like butter. They just melted in your mouth. The sauce that accompanied them was also delicious and unlike anything I had ever had before. It was red with a color and texture almost like tomato sauce. It tasted like it had some chili in it but it was sweet and also had some garlic and other savory flavors in there. It was so delectable that my mom wanted to keep it to put it on her bowl of rice that came with her entr\u00e9e but our server informed us that was not the right way to eat it.  Too bad, because that sauce was fantastic!\n\nCaf\u00e9 Ga Hyang has really made me a fan of Korean food and if it was closer to where I lived I definitely would be back. A huge thank you to this restaurant for being so accommodating for our large group and making it a fabulous experience!!!"
4,"Beautiful setting, lots of people, beer, brats ice cream, and live music. The place to be on a summer night! 5 stars!!"
4,"We had dinner there, the place is always packed. Once you eat there you will know why. The food was amazing. We ordered this \""The natural\"" drink, ohh the flavors I loved them. Then came the Mediterranean salad, very good, then the Kale something pizza, which was totally completely unique... We ordered cheese ravioli from the kids menu for my son. My son just loved it, i mean i know my son, he is so picky and fussy about his food and it was just 6 o clock and he ate his meal very nicely, that means it was sure was delicious.\n\nWe are vegans so great for us. The food was so healthy and fresh, we just loved it"
4,"Lets be clear, this is a DIVE Bar.  It's small, low lit, the prices are cheap, the drinks are strong, the burgers are big, and the people are friendly.  If you are looking for a place to relax after work and get something good to eat, this is the place.  The Bacon Cheeseburger is actually smothered with real bacon (and only $5), and they offer fresh homemade onion rings.  Thursday mornings they offer the $2 special - 2 eggs, toast, bacon, and hash browns.  Don't go here if you are expecting a high-end bar or college hangout, it's a working man's (or woman's) bar.   \n\nP.S.  They offer Smut and Eggs on the weekends, so I would avoid bringing the children."
1,I went to this Pei Wei a while back. it was crowed and the foods taste good. I stop going there after I saw the bad reviews on TV channel 5 in 2005. There were 8 violations regarding to their kitchen. \n\nI still like the Pei Wei at other locations though.
3,"This place is great, it is a counter service little cafe place but they cook up fresh good quality food.  They have wraps, sandwiches, pastas, salads, smoothies, and breakfast.  My favorite thing there is the 440 sandwich which is chicken, roasted tomatoes and bells, goat cheese, avocado, on ciabatta.  Nothing is greasy and everything tastes fresh.  They also have a nice little patio out front to dine al fresco if it's nice outside.  It is kind of a scene being the type of place it is and being in the middle of summerlin but no big deal, there are usually a bunch of hot summerlin mom's to check out while you wait for your food.\n\nThew only down side is this place is a tad on the expensive side, everything from 9 - 11 bucks I think, if it was a deal I would give it a 5 possibly, there food does come with fries, salad, or rings so it is't too bad.\n\nOverall a great place, the kind of place vegas needs more of."
0,"It's really too bad that Yelp doesn't have a negative star rating because that's what I would give the this hotel.\n\nThere are three adjectives that I use to describe this facility are rude, inefficient, and arrogant (plus tacky and unclean!)\n\nOn July 3rd, our Auto Club travel agent made a reservation for us for August 17 through the 19th.  We put the lodging fees on our credit card--had a receipt showing both the payment and the reservation.\n\nOn August 17th, after driving over 600 miles through rain and lightning storms from Northern California, I went to the front desk to check in for our family.  The clerk looked at his computer and said our reservation had been cancelled on July 17th (and our credit had still be charged).  I was shocked and showed him my receipt and reservation document.  He went to talk to his manager (Matthew) who basically told me that he would do what he could but if his superior said no we would be out of luck (that meant that my wife, daughter, and myself, after paying and making reservations, would have no place to stay.) \n\nI became furious because we had paid, the hotel staff had listed the wrong date on the reservation, and rather showing compassion and concern, Matthew showed as much warmth as an iceberg in the Arctic.  When I reacted in anger, he said he wasn't going to do anything that would guarantee us a stay. We then were forced to go find another hotel to stay at for the evening (this at 11:15 pm on a Friday night).\n\nI wrote a letter to their CEO almost a month ago detailing what had happened and heard nothing back from him.\n\nWhen it comes to reliability, courtesy, and concern, THIS HOTEL IS NOT A HARD ROCK IT IS A SOFT PEBBLE."
4,"Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty."
0,"When we asked the manager, Alan, how much he would pay for the tattoos my niece received the night prior and his response is \""nothing\"" that is a clear indication of the quality of this tattoo shop. There is a big sign on the door indicating no one under 18 is allowed without ID, but no worries they won't ask for one anyway.  She and her friend (barely over 18)  were able to get tattoos by simply signing a consent form, and did *not* show their ID.  Mike did the tattoo and left her with dry blood and ink; I expect tattoos to bleed, but don't expect dry blood (that may have rubbed off his glove) 3 inches from the tattooed area.  It looked completely unsanitary and she left with no after care at all.  The tattoos were very simple in design, yet the quality is extremely poor with an outrageous cost -- as indicated by the manager's comment.  Yes, Alan did offer to fix the tattoos after they healed, but would you go back to this place?  Absolutely not."
3,"Recently visited this place for lunch and was pretty satisfied with what The Arrogant Butcher had to offer. I have made it a point to try all of the Phoenix City Scape restaurants and become familiar with the lunch menus of these restaurants.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a graciously hip host who made us feel very welcomed. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty cool and the location is perfect for downtown lunch commuters. \n\nI had the turkey pastrami sandwich and my friend has the cobb salad. The turkey pastrami sandwich was really amazing and the lunch portions were satisfying enough. I am not a big turkey fan but I will be calling this one of my all time favorite sandwiches, the coleslaw that accompanies that sandwich adds much need texture and is also refreshing. The fresh parmesan fries were great as well.\n\nPlan on visiting this place during your lunch break if you have an hour or more. The place was not busy and it took around 25-30 minutes to receive a sandwich and a salad. This is the only reason why I did not rate a 5/5. \n\nBut overall great resaturant, good food, good prices, good ambience, good drinks, and great experience. Will visit again soon."
4,"If you're planning to do a dinner and show here in Vegas, then the KA and Craftsteak package is the way to go. ($175-$199 PP). Show tickets themselves are around $125-$150. \n\nCraftsteak was simply amazing. The stars speak for themselves. We had:\n\nAppetizers\nGrilled Quail\nRoasted Red Reppers\nMixed Lettuces\n\nEntrees\nHangar Steak (shared)- get it medium\nRoasted Chicken - juicy juicy juicy\nDiver Sea Scallops \n\nSides\nYukon Gold Potato Puree  - I didnt expect it to be so good. \nRoasted Shiitake Mushrooms - i usually dont eat these, but i gobbled them down. \nRoasted Asparagus\n\nDesserts\nMonkey Bread w/ice cream - very sweet\nCrumble Berry \nCheesecake w/ice cream\n\nYou get fresh warm bread with your meal. They have a wine special for $30. They give you 3 different wines, 1 for each entree. \n\nLike women walking out of a spa.....I felt pampered and fullfilled. The food made love to my mouth and spooned with my stomach. \n\nI'll be back!"
1,"My bestie loves this place and I can't understand why at all. The service is bland, the food is bland, the atmosphere is bland. I was meeting a friend and got there a little early. The three hostesses at the stand were less than friendly, but they seated me right away. 10 minutes later a server finally comes, but she was nice. I ordered a Michelada, and it was GROSS. \n\nMy friend showed up so we ordered ceviche and fajitas. The ceviche tasted like the shrimp was already cooked and then mixed in with lime juice, which it's supposed to be cooked BY the lime juice, or something like that. It just didn't taste right. The fajitas were okay, but the tortillas became crispy as soon as they cooled down within a few minutes. I had one and was done.\n\nI switched up my drink for a margarita, and that too didn't taste right. It was sickly sweet. I couldn't even finish my tiny margarita. The bill was almost $100. I'm glad my friend offered to pay or I would've felt extremely cheated and maybe would've given just 1 star.  Definitely NOT my cup of tea."
1,"Very fun atmosphere. Bright insides with great artwork EVERYWHERE! The food is fresh and made to order. Lots of specials. I had the chicken salad sandwich and fresh New England clam chowder soup. Tons of clams in the soup and the chicken salad was good (had apples and celery). I specially asked for Miracle Whip (request option on the menu) on the sandwich and that was a great blast from the past taste. \n\nI liked the music playing and the games on every table. Great service too.\n\nPROS: Great interior and excellent service.\n\nCONS: Food was just average at best.\n             My boyfriend HATED it. \n            *Big Fish Sandwich - Over breaded and too much bread in general. \n             Needed more tartar sauce or lettuce or something.\n             *Chicken Avocado BLT - I ordered \""breaded\"" for the chicken. \n              It came out fried to a crisp and the thin cutlet inside was dry as a bone. \n\nTwo stars only because of the great atmosphere and decor. I would give the service 5 stars if that was a separate option."
1,"Not very good.  Three of us ate here at dinner time. It was fast and inexpensive, but not very good.  I had a chicken taco plate and it was ok but made my stomach hurt later. The two with me both ordered cheese enchiladas and both were unhappy. They both complained that the enchiladas were cold in the middle. Not acceptable. Also, the salsa was right out of the fridge so it made the food even colder. I'm guessing that breakfast burrito everyone raves about must be the only really good thing on the menu. I'll never know. We won't be going back. I've decided I don't like eating my mexican food on styrofoam plates so will steer clear of these mediocre taco shops."
4,"Unassumingly set in the back corner of the Town and Country Mall and demarcated by a sign simply reading \""Italian Restaurant\"" I'll start out by saying that even if Bianco had chosen to put his name on the space it would have been tricky to find, but the fact that it goes under such a generic moniker almost seems to reinforce the fact that the chef isn't trying to rest on his name alone, but instead to focus on the food he holds dear.  With rustic signage and large glass windows looking into the open kitchen there is not a shred of evidence that this is a \""celebrity chef\"" restaurant and, really, if one didn't know any better they could walk right by without paying the space a second thought.\n\nWith the time just before 2:00pm and lunch hours till 3:00 I walked through the doors to find the interior largely similar to the outdoors and with the kitchen behind a small bar to the right and three other couples seated amidst the ~40 unmatched chairs and old wooden tables to the left the feeling was instantly anything but that of another Arizona shopping center. Working on a small crew of three during the late lunch hours I stood for a moment at the hostess stand before being greeted by the Chef who introduced himself as Rob and suggested I take any seat I like, eventually settling on a cozy two-top beneath one of the ceiling fans as the room was a bit warmer than I'd prefer.  Settled in and with my books in hand it would not be long before I was greeted by Hillary, the sole server for the afternoon, who presented the 13-item menu.\n\nWith a vibe that speaks to a sleepy Italian villa from the shabby chic seating to paintings straight out of the hands of Italian street artists I spent a few moments perusing the menu before Hillary returned and with iced water in hand and the chef agreeable to my gnocchi request it would not be long before a plate of Pane Bianco Bread with Olive Oil would arrive from the kitchen and after a short conversation with my server about what I was reading I turned my attention to the crusty yeasted roll that, while good on its own, was vastly improved by ample use of the grassy and slightly fruited oil.\n\nMoving next to my special request, I really did not know what to expect from the preparation as it was simply listed as \""Potato Gnocchi with Arizona Sweet Corn and Zoe's Pancetta\"" but seeing as how I love all three ingredients I figured it would be good no matter what; little did I know that it would be the best gnocchi I've had in my life.  Beginning first with the potato dumplings, each of the little balls was hand cut, light as a cloud, and literally melt in the mouth tender even after a quick sear in the pan but moving past the obvious pasta skills of the restaurant what truly put this dish over the top was the ragu-a sort of half roasted corn kernel/half creamed corn imbued with cream and smoky notes from the pork amalgam absolutely teaming with both sweet and savory notes. So simple, so rustic, and yet so perfect I simply cannot say enough about this dish-the one that finally unseeded Marc Vetri's 2 year stranglehold on the best version of my very favorite pasta.\n\nAs I swooned over each bite of the gnocchi Hillary kept my water filled and stopped by repeatedly to check in and find out when I was ready for my sandwich and although I was sad to see the gnocchi go I was happy to see the \""House-Made Mozzarella with Prosciutto Di Parma\"" sandwich arrive in the same vivid glory as the one from a month prior at Pane.  Again focused on bucolic simplicity and flawless ingredients it would be hard to find fault in this sandwich or its accompanying fennel and lettuce salad in a light vinaigrette but as good as the Prosciutto was I couldn't help but think I liked the tomato slightly better...though I bet a version with all three would be stunning.\n\nAt this point quite full and with dinner plans that would turn out to be quite extensive Hillary stopped by and boxing up half of my sandwich asked if I'd like dessert-a suggestion I nearly declined until her smiling description of the Asian Pear Crostata sold me that it was something I should probably just go with - and go with it I did, a bargain basement $5 for superlative poached pear served over a rustic butter pastry and topped with vanilla infused cream. Light, delicate, and much like the pasta and the sandwich a perfect evidence of what one should expect from all of Bianco's restaurants-perfect ingredients largely unmanipulated and prepared just enough to extract maximal flavor.  \n\nA charming space with lovely service and food that speaks to everything I love about Italian it would be hard for me to find a single bad thing to say about Italian Restaurant and with an offer to stay and study as long as I liked the only thing that kept me from lingering at 4743 N 20th St was the fact that it was a little too warm for such a full stomach-it made me feel like I needed a nap; yet another sign of a very successful meal.  I'll be back, no doubt."
3,Nice layout of the casino. Lots of slot machines that aren't in other casinos. Like Yahtzee. The bathrooms are clean as well. Lots of delicious eaterys. The convention rooms are expansive and the halls have comfortable seating thru out.
4,"I love this place because it is consistently a 5 star restaurant. Every time you walk through the door you know that you will be having an absolutely superb meal. \nThe servers are perfectly attentive without being overbearing. They're knowledgeable, friendly, and pleasantly enthusiastic. The food is always fresh, well matched flavors and they love to use simple ingredients that create a well balanced course. Did I mention their dessert is absolutely to die for? Oh, coffee too. \nI cannot wait to try the spring menu, I'll definitely be bringing a nice bottle of wine and relaxing for awhile."
4,"Best Pedicure in Las Vegas, hands down ( no pun intended). So I very apprehensively  tried this place a few weeks ago. I have extremely high standards in regards to cleanliness, attention to detail. My technician was Bamboo. Bamboo should get an award for turning my hooves into beautiful, smooth, pretty feet. I should probable go the DMV and change my reported height. I would imagine I'm about a 1/4 shorter after my callus removal :-) I love them, and I'm sure you will too!"
0,"A big college football Saturday and they had 2 bartenders. Horrible service, okay food, and they change the channels to anyone's whim. Meaning, if a top 25 team is playing and two nothing teams are playing there is no rhyme or reason to changing the channel. Won't be back."
3,i like the quality of food here and icome here every 1-2 weeks. My favorite dish is chicken Makhani. chicken Masala and some of the lamb dishes are also worth trying. Good atmosphere and kind owners. downside is that it takes about 20-25 min for food to be served. prices are somewhat high.  did not like their buffet because there is no variety of food.
2,"Nice staff as mentioned in a prior review, but they have replaced the steering rack on my Silverado 5 times in the past 3 years!!!!! Yes, that is right, and after the one they recently put on 8/26/14 is leaking and loose. That means it is going in tomorrow. I just paid $252 in labor to put it on as it was outside of 6 months. The steering hose was leaking and they replaced it for free. Mike the Manager tries his best to make things right."
3,"What a great experience.  So happy we weren't let down.  We were customers of Aiello's when they were open (same Owners) and always had a great meal.\nHad the fish & chips & fries and it was great.  The fish was so mild and fresh and the breading was delicious...not over breaded.  My husband had the burger and I tasted it (of course) and agreed with him, that it was a winner.  The dessert we had was the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce and it was a home run!!  Of course, the best part of the whole experience was Brian, who always took care of us at Aiello's and now is at Charr.  We will definitely be returning.....many times!!"
3,"I really enjoy this place, I just moved here from Chicago and I always miss some good Korean food.  This place was the first place in Arizona that I've found that has really good korean food!  They have all your traditional dishes and then some Japanese food as well. \n\nThe service there is really good as well, they are always attentive to my needs! \n\nGreat place highly recommended especially if you want to try Korean food!"
2,"Went to see Arcade Fire here last night. was excited to check out the Joint since they moved it when remodeling Hard Rock. Saw a bunch of shows at the old one, but haven't got to too many shows since my kids were born. \n\nHad balcony seats which I expected to allow me to go onto the floor also, but it seems they charge more for that and keep you separated. Could have snuck on but whatever. Went up to balcony, back to our seats in 401 Row J seats 7,8 and after the first 2 songs sounding like DJ train wrecking, I thought either Arcade Fire got wasted in Vegas or the sound is sooooo bad in those seats. I had a feeling it was the latter as no speakers were close and it seemed like a lot of reverb getting in the way. \n\nSo we got up and walked up front to an opening by the railings on side, were we walked into balcony area. Much better sound. Better view too. Stayed there for rest of the show which was great. Arcade Fire was awesome live and sounded great in new spot. \n\nThe floor looked mobbed but I assume sounded good down there too. All in all there is nothing special or exciting about this place as a concert venue, and I would recommend either getting floor or standing up front in balcony. They need to buy separate speakers for balcony seats in back. Very Lame for someone who might not have known it was just bad place to be sound wise."
3,Great break from everything big on the strip.  Pretty interesting crowd but staff seemed to be on the ball.
0,Stopped in for a post Pirate game beer last night. I ordered an IPA and sat down at the bar. I couldn't wait to leave as the sour smell of stale beer and who knows  what wafted from the tap drains. Call bar rescue! \nThe annoying lady with her cell phone pugged in at the bar didn't help my my experience either.
2,"I had to think of some options for a jazz club, and while there are quite a few places to go in this great city, La Maison is a bit of an institution and it was also convenient at the time for where I was staying.\n\nThe place as you probably know from reading, has a mandatory coat check, cover.. etc...\n\nI did not have any of the food, but settled in at a much later time to hear some music and just have a drink and take it in easy for the late night. The vibe here is classic, huge amounts of wood, chandeliers, green naugahyde booths with brass rivets, giving a great feel.  Much eye candy in ambience.  The waitresses wear flapper style feathers from their hair, and the place feels classy, but it also looks like that even with the cover they don't really enforce a dresscode either.\n\nI am a big cocktail fan, and the options here listed are some of the basics, with a list of martinis that range to basic standards to has beens (apple and chocolate I am looking at you).  My wife went for an Americano, props for having this on the menu and I asked for a Brandy Alexander which unfortunately was made with milk and not cream like it should, but this is disclosed on the menu.  It was also served on ice which in my opinion is a big no no.\n\nI get the impression they are not big on the cocktails here, this is not a cocktail nerds paradise by any stretch.  Drink service is also a little slow, but nothing horrid, but a floor manager dressed impecably would often come out with what appeared to be warmed home made chips with salt and black pepper to our table and others.\n\nStill the place is a bit pricey to see some music, and you are paying for the atmosphere.  I liked this place but certainly didn't fall in love with it.  It also has decent acoustics.  But if it's in your area it's worth checking out, it is an institution no question."
2,"Munchies is okay, but it doesn't hold a candle to Yogurtland, IMHO.  On my last visit I couldn't find a flavor that I liked.  Vanilla tasted the best of all of them, and that never happens!  A lot of the flavors taste very artificial.  The friends I go there with, though, always pick up a couple of pre-packed quarts to take home, so I guess I'm in the minority.  I'm not a toppings person, except for an occasional little squirt of fudge, so I can't judge or compare those.\n\nBut Menchies is much closer to my house, and I love that they support the community, so I will continue to patronize them."
4,"American Shooters is a great place to purchase a firearm or shoot at the range. Very helpful and friendly staff. Made me feel very comfortable and confident in selecting a firearm. The range is very nice and clean, you can even shoot your own ammo."
3,"This is a really nice new location that has one of the strangest entrances from the Belmont Abby side on the planet! Who doesn't like a little Indy Car race track curves and dips on the way to a hardware store?!? I guess they did this to find out who knows how to tie down their lumber before they get to a main road? Sheesh it's ridiculous, but if you're in your car it's pretty fun to zoom around.  \n\nAnyway back to the store... Tons of selection and the garden center in the spring is gorgeous. The staff answered all my questions and I was able to find what I needed. \n\nPlease people if you own a truck don't buy bag mulch or dirt!! Sure if you only need a bag then go ahead, but if you need a giant load there is a better option. Go to a local nursery or garden center and buy a scoop or two of it and they will load it in your truck!!! You'll save tons of cash by not buying it pre-packaged in beautiful marketing branded bags. Yes your truck will get a little dirty, but isn't that why you bought a truck!?!  I can't stand seeing guys loading 20 bags of mulch in a perfectly useful truck bed. Seriously for less than $20 a scoop you'll get way more mulch and actually look like a man!!"
4,Delicious! I was in tonight because of the 50% off locals offer-genius! Everything was really really good! Our server Jessica was fantastic and always checking up on the table! \n\nI highly recommend the hummus appetizer and scallop entree. \n\nMy one complaint would be that the scallops came out cold but they were delicious anyway! \n\nHighly recommended!
1,"I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. \n\nThe menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!"
1,"Bleh.  I do not like this location at all!  I normally don't have anything bad to say about AMC Theatres, but this one just makes me mad.  First of all, the bathrooms are terrible!  They are way too small and somehow manage to look like they're 30 years old!  I also hate the location of this one with all the awful chains around (not awful because they're chains, but awful because their food/product is awful).  The actual theatres are not the nicest and could use a bit more thorough cleaning after each show.  The seats are strangely small.  I feel like they ordered the wrong chairs for this one because they don't feel like any of the other AMC's that I've been to.  Last but not least, this theatre is entirely over-run by children.  They are everywhere and their parents don't seem to care how their screaming and whining bothers other people.  Ugh.  I won't come back unless I have to."
0,"This review is based on the fact I was a guest here and live locally. I had to be at work early the next morning and was late due to the parking structure guy. \nUpon arriving at check in I asked for my white ticket to get validated. He gave me a parking pass and said I didnt need the white one. Sweet. \n\nTurns out I DID need that ticket and it caused me to be late. \nThe parking guy gave me 2 options: sit and wait for security to come and id have to prove that its my car (it wasnt...it was clearly a work truck)  or go back to the room where the white ticket was left. I tried waiting but 5 minutes seems like forever when you know youll be late by the time they figure out that you are legit. \nAfter having to re-park, go downstairs, then the elevator back up to the room then back down and out to the garagr.....uggh....yeah. I was late. \n\nNeedless to say, I probably wont stay here again."
0,"The mini donuts are gone. I hear they are going to bring some other people in to try and do it, but forget it.\nThe family that ran it made them best.\nIts all downhill from here, Im afraid"
4,I love this place!  The people that run this join are top notch!  When I visit Pittsburgh I love to go to the Cantina.  Yinz should get down on it.
3,"Saw a noodle house advertised and wondered where it was.  Been eating at Phoenix Palace for several months before I discovered China Magic.  First time we were the only patrons in the restaurant; my friend from Long Island is very particular about her Chinese food; she loves this place.  My other friend is very picky about food to begin with; but still he loves this place.  So, we brought another friend from the Philippines and he really loves this place.  Just mostly stick to the noodle dishes.  Wish the drive wasn't so far; but definately be back."
3,Need more of these in the valley upgrade from chili's. I like their menu food is good. Great happy hour. Didn't care to much for crab cakes
0,"Food was alright if you know what you want. Horrible service. Over charged us and they didn't refund us or apologize for their mistake. By the way, don't get the shrimp with lobster sauce. Looks like a plate of goo, it was unappetizing ."
3,"I love their ready made foods! It's a bit pricey with most items but I enjoyed a 1/2 turkey & swiss panini for ~$3.50 today. My husband devoured the most beautiful rotisserie chicken breast either of us had ever seen. If they sold Naked Juice, I likely would've splurged for a Pomegranate-Blueberry juice. They have chocolate covered dried bananas! I have not been able to find them anywhere else in town."
3,"A great after hours spot!  Atmosphere here is very lively. The decor fits the time and mood when you get there. Good high tempo music and did I mention, its free to get inside =) \nAt least when I went on a Friday night through Saturday morning."
1,"Disappointing. My mom and I stopped by here after some late afternoon shopping, as it is located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, and we were looking to party for our last night in town. We ordered a couple margaritas, and they were intensely sweet and too strong to enjoy. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting my money's worth when I order a drink but there is a difference between a stiff drink and one that is so strong you don't want to drink it.) We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer while we looked over the menus. Again, we were prepared to stay a while. It actually took 20 minutes for us to see our chips and salsa. The presentation was nice, and it included 3 different salsas to try. The chips were crisp and fresh. We were not offered any cornbread that other tables were getting. By the time we had finished the bowl of chips, we had not been offered any more drinks, or asked for our food orders. It wasn't very busy, so I was confused as to what was taking so long. Since I work in the industry, I think I show more patience than most, but this was just pathetic. Finally a second bartender came on and asked if we were doing okay and we asked for our bill. From the moment we sat down, we spent over an hour there, and all we had to show for it were some chips and salsa and a couple of bad drinks. It was a total mood killer for the two of us who were prepared to party and spend our money at Z'Tejas. Lesson learned!"
2,"Slow Boat to Greek Isles\nThere is no scent as stimulating to my appetite as that of garlic in the oven or on the range top. This is just what greeted us as we walked in one rainy evening about 5:30 just off the light rail line in Charlotte. The setting is lively and open with tables well-spaced and the staff is attractive and friendly. We got menus soon enough and drinks were ordered. My choice was a local IPA, sorry I have forgotten the name of the brewery. It was cloudy! Tasted all right and I assume that this is what the brewer had in mind but it was weird. Not sure I will ever get use to that. Appetizers followed with Tzatziki and Feta for all and they, especially the Tzatziki were good for sure. Then we waited and hour for our meal to come!!\n\nOur water was certainly a nice chap and perhaps new at his job but clearly needed some help on the management side of his work. Don't know what the holdup but it was obvious and no apologies. To top it off I think I chose wrong off the menu. My salt cod may have been frozen and packaged. I can't be sure but it was very ordinary. I ate it all of course buy my companion's veal shank or dolmades looked much better. Dinner took so long that we did not have a time for dessert which is a shame. The cart up front with samples looked delicious. I'm going to have to give this a 3 because of my meal and the service. I'd like to go back and try again, it's very reasonable and convenient to down town without being down town but, I don't know."
4,"Seems I've stumbled upon another salad, soup & sandwich location with wifi. These places will always have a special meaning to me. Ok on with the review,  ( that's 2 thumbs up for the none iphone users). The vibe of this place gives me a relaxed & above average cafe style eatery. They gave a great selection of salads, soups & sandwiches all conveniently laid out in description which helps. There's a $7.99 special which you pick 2 out the 3( soup, salad or sandwich) which isn't bad. \n\nI had the $7.99 special, a turkey & avocado sandwich, a chicken caesar salad  and greedy me had to have the Lobster & red pepper soup. For some reason I can never pass up on lobster soups, this one was delicious, and yes I plan on returning to have this soup again. They also had gumbo on the soup menu which made the \""soup choosing\"" selection hard but lobster wins every time. Something about this place I like, maybe the cleanliness, the brightness or could be the free wifi sign on the door. Whatever it is I plan on returning.. That's for certain. \n\nPS: and you get chocolate strawberries with your meal.. #sweet"
3,"A star was taken away for service and price.  Yes it is more food and better quality than your standard hibachi restaurant but the price is pretty ridiculous in comparison.  The server had to argue about doom alcohol on separate receipt since we were using a gov't credit card.  Don't get the sushi since it is way overpriced and not comparable to a sushi restaurant.  Unlike other Beni's this one does not offer a full sushi lineup, probably b/c there is a sushi bar next door."
2,"Nothing wowed me about this place..maybe it was the buildup of the famous frozen hot chocolate but I've had better food. I ordered fried eggs benedict which was definitely unique, but pretty bland. Everyone else was just ok with their food as well. The frozen hot chocolate was decent, I don't really get the hype..but it looked pretty!"
1,"It was our first time there. The service was great at first and then it got worse as the night went on. Our drinks and appetizer came out pretty quickly but we had to wait at least 45 mins for our entrees to be served. We should had said something when the people at the table next to us sat down and got their food before we did. When our food finally arrived it was lukewarm. We ate a few bites and took it home to heat it up. We told the server about it and she didnt say much about it and just said she was sorry.  The sad part about it ! It was our 33rd Anniversary.  The food was tasty but cold. I might give it another try, maybe happy hour would be good. Very Disappointed!"
0,When my girlfriend transferred her service over to our place they told her that we would have the internet that day but when we got home from work we still had no internet and when she called them they told her that now we wouldn't get it until Monday. So now she has to miss work on Monday to make sure that the internet is working. This company is a joke. If she'd had not paid her bill when she did then we would have cancelled the services with them.
0,"This bar use to be Mulligan's and was a blast 7 days a week. After a name change, some renovations, and a hand full of owners and mangers. This place is complete crap. \nOn two occasions I've gone and waited for a server and either I had to ask the bartender or security to track a server down after 5-10min of waiting. On a busy night I would understand, however when my group in one if maybe 3 tables there's no excuse. \nFood is inconsistent, and disappointing compared to its competitors. And the fact that I've gotten sick from eating there twice is another reminder on why I refuse to return to this bar."
3,"I ordered delivery through them from Wheel Delivery, so I can't attest to the atmosphere of the actual restaurant, but the food was decent. I moved here from San Diego a few months ago and it's been hard to find Mexican food that's been up to par. That being said, that's the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me- I'm conditioned to knowing what authentic Mexican food tastes like, and it wasn't quite at that level.\n\nBUT ...I think it's a good substitute and the best I've had in Pittsburgh, and I'll definitely be ordering from them again.\n\nPros:\nFresh tortillas\nGreat salsa\nBig menu with west coast options\n\nCons:\nFish tacos pretty much fall apart in your hands (although they're delicious)\nCarne asada in the California burrito was a bit too much like ground beef\nBacon in breakfast burrito was undercooked and fatty"
4,"This was my first here! And it definitely won't be my last. I was greeted by Rashaad. Such a sweetheart. Helped me with my decisions, explained everything thoroughly & even opened the door for me on the way out. From start to finish, everything was absolutely perfect. Oh yeah.. & The food is DELICIOUS!"
3,"Beautiful salon with a wonderful owner who made planning a fun Bachelorette celebration really easy and enjoyable. For a reasonable cost per person, we were able to close the salon to just our private party of seven where three stylists got to work while we had champagne and crudite all ready and set up for us to enjoy. (They even decorated with some special Bachelorette signs and balloons).\nThe bride-to-be loved it all and while the degree of everyone's satisfaction with the actual blowouts/styles were all over the spectrum, the overall experience was really nice."
0,"Had high hopes for this place, but wow... the reviews from the newspapers must be several years old; our service was terrible, the food was barely mediocre, and the prices were outrageous.\n\nYes, it's located on the Yahara.  But that's about all this place has going for it... $8 for an appetizer of potato chips?  $8 for cheese curds??  And what may have very well been the slowest, most unhelpful service ever?\n\nMe thinks not.  Not sure what could be done to redeem this place.  We were ready to spend all night and countless dollars here, but the poor service drove us away after just an hour.  Ugh.  We even asked the waitress point blank if there was anything we could do to improve the service and we got a roll of the eyes (along with more bad service).  One of the people at our tables offered to give her an additional tip upfront - it didn't even phase her.   \n\nCase in point: we waited 30+ minutes for 2 taps and a margarita.  We could see the taps sitting at the bar for at least 20 minutes, but couldn't flag a waitress no matter how hard we tried.  \n\nBourbon Street Grille = FAIL\n\nService = 0 stars\nFood = 2 stars (decent for bar food...)\nValue = 1 star \nMisc = 3 stars (nice atmosphere, and it's on the river)\n\n\nFinal thoughts: Menu is hardly cajun - yes, they have a gumbo and a jambalaya, and they \""blacken\"" some dishes, but that's about the extent of their creole/cajun menu.  If you want some wraps, some deep fried foods, and a mediocre experience, there are a lot of other places to visit."
3,"Just an update for dairy-free folks. There was a miscommunication. When I asked if it was diary free, they said yes... referring to the batter. Unfortunately, they still dip everything in milk to make the batter stick. I don't know why they didn't think to mention this. Still great people, but you would think after countless times of me saying \""I'm dairy free, so no coleslaw\"" that they would think to mention that everything is dipped in milk! Still really nice people, though."
4,One of the best if not the best ever Bone In Rib Eye Ive ever had. There wasnt a bad bite of that steak. It was cooked to perfection. Great stop on the book tour to a some what hidden away gem upstairs in Planet Hollywood.
1,"Been here a few times in the past since the \""new\"" ownership took over a few years ago.  Hadn't been there for a while... decided to return with the family for dinner.  I was SHOCKED to see how much the prices had risen.  I've worked in several professional kitchens.  I understand food costs, profit margins, etc.  Trust me, WAY overpriced.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I gathered the family and left as soon as I saw the menu...something I've never done.  Like I said, the food's alright.  I respect the individual restaurateur, usually some of the hardest working people you'll meet.  But, I work hard for my money too.  CYD, you're gonna have to do better than that."
0,"Absolutely the most disgusting bathrooms I have ever seen, worse than a 29 Palms roadside gas station. Every time I dine there I bring up the dirtiness of the facility and every time I return (hoping thay have rectified the situation) the bathroom seems the same.\n\nThe only saving grace is the excellent food (especially the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast)  and waitstaff in the restaraunt, if not for that reason I would never step foot in there."
1,"My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.\n\nLet me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.\n\nI ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.\n\nWe both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.\n\nAnd what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.\n\nThe sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.\n\nAs for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.\n\nIn summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.\n\nLastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left."
1,"I like their selection, but their customer service is amateur hour."
1,"Small location located in china town...it looks kinda dingy when you walk in, especially compared to the giant Lee's sandwiches a block away. Everything is marked up (though still cheap for Vegas) as compared to California ($2.75 for THREE spring rolls in the 626, here is $4 for two). But hey, when you're desperate for some asian yummies and you aren't willing to shell out $8 for non-legit spring rolls on the strip, you gotta go somewhere, right? \n\nThe desserts are pretty yummy...pandan-coconut milk-coffee jello is a bit too sweet. Coconut milk with taro, yam, and tapioca is super yum. Spring rolls are squishy...shrimp ones (goi cuon) is very squishy and mostly rice paper. The vegetarian spring rolls are insanely dry. And yet...I keep coming back :X Mostly for the desserts!"
2,Great food. Not very expensive.
0,Make sure if you want a salad u buy it out of the case.  I asked for a chicken Cesar because there was none left and got charged an extra 4 bucks.  Was it any different - hell no!   Took him 30 seconds to make it and didn't even toss it- got my bag of dressing and off i  went. Oh and when I asked why it was more $ they told me it came with fries-!  A salad with fries- not a chance. So I tried to reason with the manager after he realized that it was a salad (w no fries) as to me having to pay a penalty because they were out- and he just didn't get it.  I am sorry I asked for them to make me one- would've preferred they told me they were out.   At least they couldve warned me it was more $   The salad was fine-but its the principle of it.  Next time I will skip that food option
1,"I brought some out of town friends here. I had never been before and the atmosphere look fun so we tried it. The look is cool and they had comfortable chairs. The menu seemed over priced. I sprung the extra $2 for the Doritos mac and cheese. It was good but for the extra money a bigger portion was expected. I ordered the chili cheese burger. I was never asked how I wanted it cooked. It came out VERY over done. My friend ordered the veggie burger and got a portabella mushroom sandwich instead, We asked the waitress about it. She looked puzzled and said \""You don't like it?\"" she told her it was good but not what she ordered the waitress continued to say that she heard her order this. I couldn't believe it the waitress was arguing when it was clearly her mistake. I won't be back."
1,They have pricing for super rich people.  You can go there and see lots of cool guns that are selling for significantly more than they would outside of Scottsdale.
4,Tried Bouillabaisse for the first time at Oyster Bar this trip and it was amazing! It might be my go to dish from now on. \n\nAmazing oysters...so meaty and clean. We ended up making the trek twice! \n\nTip: There's almost no wait when you go around 3pm. Any later and a line starts to form.
2,"For our first meal in Vegas, we decided to go Mexican. After walking around the Miracle Mile Mall, this was the first thing that caught our eye. Location wise, it's probably not the best considering you'd have to go all the way around the one mile mall to get to where it is. \n\nChatty staff, good service and an awesome selection of food (platters, wraps, burgers, sandwiches etc). I ordered the Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap and Chips and Salsa. My friend got the BBQ Chicken Wings. My wrap had chunks of avocado, which wins big bucks in my book. I love avocado especially if it's integrated nicely into a dish. It makes me very happy. It was quite a portion actually. One of my concerns was that it was quite greasy. But I guess I can't expect a lot from fast food. I wasn't aware that there was going to be a side of chips (which I believe were deep fried, hand cut potatoes). If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the side of chips and salsa. No biggie on those, just chips and salsa. \n\nThe wings were also just ordinary. It wasn't bad but it wasn't to die for either. \n\nI like the nice island in the middle of the store that held all the dips and sauces. I thought that was pretty cool. There was a nice variety that patrons can enjoy.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part about this store was the line up that leads to the alcoholic drink orders (there was a line for non alcoholic orders and a line for alcoholic orders). They have these really tall plastic containers that held slushie drinks. I got the smallest one, which was a half yard long slushie drink, (double shot of course) named Happy Ending. I loved it so much I came back for seconds. Really great for those days when you walk down the strip and its 35 degrees hot out. \n\nOh and if you save your drink container and bring it next time to get your drink, it's cheaper. Some people actually brought theirs back. I should have, but seeing as I was drunk for virtually the entire trip, I don't remember where I put my first container so I just got another one.\n\nWould I come back? Probably for the food. Definitely yes for the drink. Me wants me Happy Ending."
4,"I came here after reading good reviews and I was pleasantly surprised with the high level of professionalism. The environment and ambiance of the salon is very beautiful. Diane did my nails and she had been doing nails for over 20 years. She is very professional and clean. I will definitely be back,"
3,"I love, love, love the pizza here. They have great beer selections too. They have traditional flavors and new variations. They had one that was a variety of olives on top - wow - it was great. Only draw back is it's usually pretty noise and hard to have any real conversation over dinner."
1,"I'm new to the area, and on my way home from the coffee shop, I decided to stop on in. After all, I needed a new collar for my pup. \n\nI was greeted right away. Aggressively greeted, but greeted none the less. The gentleman who helped, was clearly the store manager and me spared no enthusiasm, and even up sold me to buying a new tag for the dog, too. I didn't need it, but no harm in a new shiny tag for my babe. \n\nThere was a quiet but seemingly sweet young lady behind the counter performing some kind of pet store task, and being interrupted every 35 seconds... By the gentleman who sold me on my choices and was supposed to be ringing me up. He stopped my transaction more than three times to ask her to say hello to customers who were already AGGRESSIVELY greeted by him! It took so long to just pay for the collar and tag, due to the over greeting and micro managing. I was so exhausted when I left, I said to my friend \""Remind me never to go there again\""\n\nGreat concept. But the guy running the place is just too much. I won't go back to see how grooming services are. Not if I have to deal with that guy, anyway."
0,"No play area? Bad idea when chik fil a is right down the street. The food... Its mcdonalds\n\nmonths later...\nI now officially hate this location.  My 5 year old had the day off from school and I had the day off from work.  I needed my tires rotated (see my Discount Tire comments) and it was lunch time.  My son was excited to go to McDonalds, so we dropped my car off at Discount Tire and walked to McDonalds- it was very windy and he was a little annoyed.  We got to McDonalds and their debit functionality was offline.  So I had no cash on me and I had to explain to my 5 year old that we couldn't eat there.  We had to walk back to Discount Tire and cancel our rotation.  I then called another Discount Tire with food within walking distance and they were not busy- so we went there and between the call and our arrival they got slammed.  So rather than get my tires rotated there and go to Chik-Fil-A, we drove back to our local Chik-Fil-A for a wonderful lunch.  I blame McDonalds for a horrible day."
3,"We booked a room here on Booking.com for $50 a night. The hotel is pretty nice. Think \""really nice apartment complex\"" with studio rooms. \n\nThe rooms are really big.  If you're going for fancy, this isn't your place. Honestly though, how often do you go to Vegas and spend a lot of time in your room?...thought so.\n\nThe hotel is about a 3 minute drive to the strip.  It's much more quieter than staying anywhere on the strip.  You don't have to walk through a smoke infested casino to get to your hotel room. Interior design of the rooms are not that great, but it does give off a clean feel.  The rooms have couches, a bed (or two depending on your preference), huge living area, a double stove top for your cooking convenience, cabinets, and a two door bathroom that separates the toilet from the tub and shower. \n\nThe rooms are pretty comfy and cozy and they give off a home kinda feeling. \n\nI personally liked their rooms and it definitely served its purpose.\nWho needs fancy anyway?"
3,"Cheesy Tater Tots...need I say more? The Vig offers a handful of different delish food items to choose from. They are expanding and just opened up a new location in McCormick Ranch that offers a late night menu. However, at their Uptown location my favorite drink on their signature cocktail menu is Take Bethany Home. It's refreshing and not overpowering, the perfect combination of ingredients. I highly recommend visiting The Vig closest to you!"
0,"Family night out so we chose a local place instead of a chain. We had been here before and never had the experience and terrible service we received our last time there. The service was so rude by the server we wondered if shd had something in store for us. Plates were slammed on the table,no return to check on us,no refills,loud noises in the kitchen and overcooked pasta. When she asked at the end if all was good like she cared, I said no it isnt. She then said well looks good to me and walked away again. I live nearby and notice the early closures and lack of cars now..so they get what they deserve. Too bad..was decent the first few times we went there."
3,"I have driven by Flame Kabob countless times in the course of dropping packages off at USPS, but the timing just hadn't worked out.  Last night, we were heading out to drop off some packages and were looking for somewhere to eat afterwards.   I pulled up Restaurant.com and found a $25 off $35 for Flame Kabob - just what I was looking for!\nThe restaurant is well-lit, stands out on the corner of its building, and is spacious.  The design is...  let's use \""eclectic\"".  Assorted granite tabletops and faux rock wall decor lend to a Mediterranean feel, as do the bumpin' beats laid behind sultry \""Arabic\"" vocals (I barely speak Spanish) playing overhead (at an interestingly reasonable volume).  \n\nOn the large Flatscreen TV which manages to not look TOO out of place, CNN aka The Anderson Cooper Network was broadcasting news of the Libyan uprising.  It strangely juxtaposed with the music, making me wish all news were Autotuned for our enjoyment.\n\nThe help was... well, helplful if not all that personable.  He seemed a bit irritated with us although we were the only people in the store and still ended up spending $40 for 3 people (after coupon, but also after the 18% grat was added, which wasn't really a grat, but just more income for the restaurant... meh.)\n\nOn to the food:\n\nWe ordered Hummus ($2.49), Baba Ghanoush ($1.99), Tabouli ($1.99), and uhh... the yogurt and cucmber sauce/dip (Mast-O-Khiar - $2.49) along with some extra bread ($1.99) to start .  Our \""appetizers\"" came up within about 8-10 minutes and we were off to the races, stuffing our face with as much deliciousness as we could, and it was all delicious!  The hummus had great flavor, and I actually ate Baba Ghanoush and Tabouli, neither of which I normally ever touch.  Even the bread itself was notably tasty, a rare treat and much appreciated!\n\nThe main courses were (we all shared):\nGround Beef Kabob plate ($6.99)\nGround Chicken Kabob plate ($6.99)\nGround Lamb Kabob plate ($7.99)\nTenderloin Chicken Kabob plate ($8.99)\n\nALL came with a giant pita (half of a 12\""), tons of what they underwhelmingly call \""Saffron Rice\"" (which is actually some of the most attractive, subtly flavorful, and well-cooked rice I've ever had... there's got to be a name for that!  \""Wicked Awesome Rice\"", perhaps?)\n\nBoth chicken plates got gobbled up before anyone could discuss  how they'd be divided (Fork Wars!)  On to the beef, which was perfectly seasoned (not OVERseasoned as is alllll too common in Mediterranean places).  Everything was tender, perfectly cooked, and seriously - I can't say enough about their getting the seasoning right.  Finally, a place that doesn't think \""Brian needs another cup of salt in him!\""\n\nIt was late in the day, so I'm going light on the lamb... Yes, Lamb is gamey, but done right and perfectly fresh, it's not as gamey as what I ate (I had to eat most of it - I'm our \""garbage disposal\""... \n\nAfter fulfilling my disposal duties (the lamb wasn't THAT bad... just full of lamb-y flavor!),  on came the dessert - Baklava ($1.99).\n\nHow good was it?  We bought phyllo dough, butter, pistachios and honey before we got home after being reminded just how much Baklava can DRIP WITH DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Yes, I licked the honey out of the container - what about it!?\n\nFor our $10 tip, we didn't really get any \""service\"", but this isn't that type of place... the open kitchen (awesome) was quick to let us know when our food was up (also awesome).  We considered leaving our disposable everything on the table but opted to haul it to the trash ourselved (darned morals - although we did leave a good bit of rice on the table). \n\nOn the way out, we walked past a few bags of trash which hadn't made their way to the dumpster just yet... Nothing \""shocking\"", it was late, they were nearing closing, but really... you can't just take the extra steps to the dumpster when almost no one's in the restaurant?\n\nOverall, great place, good specials (not available with Restaurant.com coupon), a little in the middle of nowhere but if you're on Sunset by the \nairport, there's few places to eat and this is a reaaaally good one.  \n\nTheir full menu is on their home page (awesome, and a rare treat... I don't care about your atmosphere and blahhhh. I'm hungry!) \n\nFor those who read to the bottom, the Peach soda ($1.99 for 12oz) was great - you're welcome!"
0,"Disorganized. Ripoffs. Rude, airhead employees that don't clean and freely talk on there cell phones whilst you asking them a simple question. Id rather rub sand in my eyes. Disgusted."
2,"What irks me about this place is the rudeness.  I know this place is located in the Strip and it's suppose to be fast paced and all, but be polite to me if you intend for me to return.\n\nI will admit I did find some decent buys for the items I needed while in here, but had no idea where to find anything.  I roamed the aisles until I stumbled upon what I needed.  However, when I did find exactly what I needed, I had to wait for a congregation of people having their Sunday chat on a Thursday to move.  When I am in this type of situation I become very irritated very easily.\n\nAlso be sure to spend at least $5 or else be prepared to be told off at checkout.  That's the cherry on top of the rudeness cake.  Not quite sure the reasoning behind this action.  You're getting my money either way."
4,"Recently went there with some friends for a Sunday brunch, and everything we ate was amazing.  I had the short rib benedict, and was amazed at how tender the beef was.  The bloody mary was spot on, too.\nTheir manager came over to our table to check on us, and spent some time explaining the the other things they have which we didn't order.  I guess they change their menu quite often (but please don't take away the rib benedict!)\nAll in all, a filling, tasty brunch.  Would go back."
3,"Third stop on an Aria/Crystals foodie crawl.  We sat down at the bar eager for some tapas and sangria.  I got a glass of red sangria ($4.50 - bargain!), which is my favorite sangria in all of Las Vegas.  Perfect spice to it.  Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.\n\nWe went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.\n\nWe also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.\n\nFinally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.\n\nA good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.  Nice atmosphere and it's open to the casino so great people watching.\n\nCheck out the bathrooms for sure here.  They are left of the bar towards the back.  Ladies to the left, mens to the right.  They pipe in some Spanish language tapes which are pretty hilarious.  Great restaurant!"
4,"This place is absolute tops in my books. I've bought a couple of guitars and some  accessories from them in the past (strings, picks, stomp boxes, etc.). Sam Ash has always been my favorite music store in town.  But my last visit warranted a 5 star rating.  I went there because they were having a sale on Fender acoustic guitars.  All the guitars were still sealed in the factory boxes. I asked the sales guy (Jack) if he had something to cut the tape on the box so I could check it out before buying it.  Well, he opened the box, completely tuned it and played a few quick chords to make sure it was up to specs before handing it over to me.  This was totally unexpected!  Jack, you have single-handedly restored my faith in customer service here in Vegas! Thanks."
3,"I stopped in for a late night drink right before they closed on a Tuesday night. It was a fair price for the High West Whiskey, but what really made my night was how Tabby and Kat made me feel welcome even though they were closing. They had plenty of time to spend with me and ask about my night. I'm a bar manager at a nice place right down the street, so I can really appreciate their late night service and the time they speny with me. Thanks!!!"
0,"My friends wanted to try it out, I warned them against it. I caved because maybe it was just first day fluke.\n\nAfter the waiter brought us items we didn't order (and still charged us for them), didn't bring us what we had ordered, was extremely slow in serving us, overcharged me, and charged one of the other girls twice (albeit an apology was given from the waiter, nothing like \""Oh, have something small and cheap free on the house the next time you come in!\"" or any other method of good customer service was offered), and the owner just kind of stood there the entire time doing nothing as this was going on other than saying she didn't know how to fix it--\n\nMy friends agreed with me. Sucks to be us."
0,"Wow this is an old hotel that they have tried to update but not successfully. The beds are very comfortable, pillows are HORRIBLE, not enough outlet to charge devices. \n\nThe checkin was an hour + wait. It's clear management does not care because the staff does not care. No one working for the hotel seem nice or customer service oriented. The food was horrible don't eat there.  Parking is on the opposite end of everything and very hard to access\n\nI will not be staying here again for any reason given the price vs quality. Although it is well situated on the strip."
2,"This place is A OK if you want to gamble. They do have Vienna hot dogs for 1 buck and a quarter. Comes with Kraut and relish if that is what you like. \n\nI got into a massive argument with some cocky gambler. I also met some cool dudes here at the same time. Yeah it was just fun and games for me here. The good thing about this place is that they have a five dollar minimum for bets. The people here are more blue collar and the working class types. It is more a a sullen mood here. I come here to bet on the NBA as they do not take NBA games across the street since the owners of the Palms also own the Sacramento Kings. I guess it is against some NBA regulations. On Certain days they open up this big room and they sell hot wings, pizza and burgers something like that. Whatever it is the prices are reasonable. \n\nThis place is definitely second rate."
3,"This place is out of the way but worth the drive. It is sort of a nightmare to find in this little office park, but once you step in, you are transported to the other side of the world into a Euro-cafe. Well maybe not exactly, but it's a great Vegas simulation. \n\nWe ordered a salad each and a sandwich to share. The sandwich was a feature not on the menu that day, Moroccan-inspired chicken with goat cheese and roasted peppers. It was fantastic. I scooped every last bite up, even though I'm trying to not eat meat or cheese. (I fail so miserably at my self-imposed dietary restrictions.) The salad was awesome too, with almondy jicama slices and a lot of other veggies. \n\nThe highlight of the meal, other than the great service provided by Oliver (who seems to be the owner?) was the chocolate torte. This was incredible. Perfectly sweet and rich, I felt the need to run a half-marathon just to get its sugary creamy goodness off my hips. \n\nI wish I worked closer so that I would have an excuse to go all the time. Loved every bite!"
1,"The food was good, the music was entertaining, but the service was really horrible.  The bartender was waiting our table - he forgot our food order, then brought us only part of the food we ordered, and didn't check back with us for our drinks. \n\nI was surprised how bad the service was, considering the rave reviews for the food.\n\nBeware if you order chicken by the piece.  Each piece costs $3.  Seriously, it is $3 PER PIECE for a wing, a leg, or a thigh."
3,"First, I must say that I'm a Hot Topic fan, in general. This particular store is pretty small in comparison to most, but it still manages to pack enough awesomeness into its crevices to keep you coming back. And what you can't find in store, you can order online. \n\nIf you're a fangirl (like myself) or fanboy who likes to have thingamajigs from your choice fandom, you're likely to find it at HT. This store has a nice selection of HP (Harry Potter), Dr. Who, Supernatural, Disney, Marvel, etc., goodies, ranging from t-shirts, jackets, & belts, to wallets & backpacks. HUGE selection of band & pop culture t-shirts. Their clothes (especially the women's jeans) run small, so keep that in mind. When I was a size 2, I needed a 7 in their jeans. (They have a sister store, Torrid, which offers plus-sizes.) \n\nGoths will find no shortage of black everything. Cute punk outfits too. Fun socks, hats, & accessories. Head to the back of the store to search for clearance sale items. \n\nThis store is neat, and there are some really cool employees working here. \n\nSign up for their free HT+ membership/rewards program and get special discounts throughout the year, including a birthday discount."
1,"So, you stay here and you're off the strip... the good thing is that they have a shuttle that will take you to the strip between the hours of 9:30am and midnight.  I didn't take it since we never actually made it to the strip.  It's a nice hotel overall.  The decor is nice, everything looks relatively new and clean.  The rooms are good, especially if you're in the suites.  Those are really nice.  HOWEVER, I have to say that the beds are terribly uncomfortable.  They're hard and so are the pillows.  I had shoulder and neck problems from them.  Also, check your pillows for possible bed bugs, as I met a woman in line for breakfast with bites all over her face from an unknown source - the last time I saw something like that it was bedbugs at a hostel.\nThe cafe downstairs is nothing major.  Decent food at any hour.  Nothing special to speak of.  During the 12:30am hour service was slow and kind of unfriendly.  During the 10am hour it was speedy and friendly.  We did the buffet on the last day there... $15 per person but terrible food.  The only fresh fruit on the salad bar was watermelon- all the rest was canned in sweet juice.  Blech!  The desserts looked better than they tasted, though the chocolate chip cookie was good.  The majority of the food wasn't anything better than what was served in the cafe restaurant, it was the same actually.  Same mediocre quality.  The cheese crepes were terrible and made with cottage cheese rather than ricotta like they're supposed to, and who puts strawberry jam in a fruit crepe?  Not good quality.\nThe staff was always friendly throughout the rest of our interactions.  It's a decent place if you're not looking for a great party experience in Vegas.  Also, it seemed this was best suited for the over 35 crowd (sorry, but I'm young and like a different experience!)."
4,I got to open a bottle of Champagne with a sword!
3,"Great job on the remodeling, folks! It's better than new. I took the twins there today. It was well worth it.  If you and your kids love science and nature museums, this is Charlotte's finest. \n\nThere is a nice blend of new, updated, and old exhibits. The rainforest exhibit is awesome. The 3D sharks movie is great, too! We caught the IMAX movie about aviation, which is, if you can get beyond the fact that it's sort of a documercial for the Boeing 787, totally worth seeing... at $8 for adults, $7 for kids, less the discount for going to the museum at the same time.\n\nWe didn't attend any of the several live demonstration/lectures that were going on around us, but they looked interesting. My kids were more interested in hands-on, kinetic features, and there are plenty to be experienced!\n\nThere are many interactive exhibits for kids of all ages to get lost in. We stayed until they (almost) tossed us out. \n\nTake some food money. The canteen has some relatively healthy sandwiches and salads, but a limited selection, and nothing to write home about. Hey, this is a place for kids, so there are way too many American snack foods and candies there, but at least they recycle most of their trash and garbage...\n\nBe sure to get there and plan to spend most of the day, if you have kids who like nature and science. If you really, *really* like it, consider a one year membership deal. We *might* get back there one more time in the next year, but probably would have to go three times to justify the one year membership."
3,"I went to go see The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Great movie. This Harkins is probably one of the nicest ones that is in Arizona. It has the Cine Capri which is cool too. All the food/snacks are expensive, but that is always a given with movie theaters, If I had to choose a Harkins to go to though, it would be this one because there are other restaurants and bars nearby if you are waiting on your movie."
4,"I should have reviewed this place long ago but I was too busy eating there to take the time to sit down and write. \n\nWe have been going here since they opened, first enticed in by a Groupon and then brought back by Chef Steve's wonderfully inspired dishes. This is a small plates restaurant so do not order one plate and expect to be full. The menu is divided into individual proteins and veggies. Read the descriptions carefully and then order enough to share. My husband and I typically order four or five plates and then hesitate over dessert. Chef Steve did a menu change recently so now we will be enjoying some new items and hope that you also try them out. Go with a group of people, its more fun\n\nThe Poke is one of my favorites, but make sure you mix it to get the seasoning all through it. One the new new additions is the Beef Carpaccio, Very flavorful. Also the shrimp dish, I believe its called Mini Mi's but its on a bun with slaw. The slaw is so good I would eat just that. They are so many dishes that it is truly had to remember. Checkout their ode to the Monte Cristo, it will make you weep. The owners work hard to provide good service and are always looking to improve. So.....if you want to eat and not be bothered go for lunch during the day. If you want busy with some music and noise check them out on a Friday night. They have a Facebook page that will tell you if there is something going on before you head out. Since I am all about the food, we go during the daytime. They also apparently have a happy hour but I don't know what that is about, I have just read the sign.\n\nThe decor is very basic, as is the plating and utensils. Because we have been coming here since the beginning, we have been able to see the changes they have made to the place over time. I can see where they have spent their money and am able to understand their choices. I would much rather have great food than great decor."
4,"I love this place, generous portions of food that taste great, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, would recommend this place to friends and family with small or large parties.... the miso black cod was excellent !!!"
2,"Long lines are typically a good sign of a solid food truck, but I think they might have been having some internal/logistical issues at the time. Ordered the chicken Mr. Bahn Mi-Yagi and was severely underwhelmed. Maybe their grill wasn't working 100% but the dog just about matched the air temp after our wait and the flavors left me wanting so much more. I felt like the small amount of radishes had more of a bite than the sriracha sauce did, which was really strange.\n\nMaybe the sun sapped my sense of taste but I felt like I had just eaten a truck stop wiener and not the gourmet experience I had been hyped to try for so long. I'd be willing to try again, but not that particular dog. The 3AM looked interesting, and the elotes locos dog looked really tasty, I think I might have just ordered their weakest offering in the bahn mi dog. Meh."
4,I've been bringing my automobiles to these guys for three years now. They've never failed to address all my problems. They are friendly to women and don't take advantage. There work is dependable and their prices are unbeatable. If there is a problem with a part they will physically show you the issue and explain how they will fix it. You will not find better mechanics in Las Vegas or Henderson! Totally trustworthy. Thanks Dynamic Auto!
4,"If you haven't been here, get off Yelp, stop looking at pics, and go!!!!!! I personally think they should have their own shop outside of 7th St. market. I've been wanting to get some of this coffe for so long but couldn't figure out where it was lol. I just happened to be in 7th St. market one Saturday and...BAM!! There it is. So my mom and I had to sit down for a cup. We had great service and great coffee. Nice atmosphere right at the bar, but everything else around is kind of a distraction. (Except for Pure Pizza). Overall it's great coffee! Check it out!"
0,Went to have lunch but they we're closed although their sign said closed for the holiday and that was yesterday. Well they just lost my business and the gift certificate I have as well will be given to someone else.
3,"This place is one of my favorite places for mexican food! Their seafood is very very good! I usually order the shrimp tacos and shrimp enchiladas. I've had other things listed on the menu, however here is the place to quality mexican seafood."
4,"This event was broken into two parts. The first was a walking tour of Bloomfield courtesy of Burgh Bits & Bites and the second was a beer tasting at Church Brew Works courtesy of Jake of PA Brew Tours.\n\nRichard and Sylvia from Burgh, Bits and Bites Tours were absolutely great! I never knew Bloomfield was so interesting and had so much history and I've lived in the Pittsburgh area my whole life. LOL! The walking tour consisted of the following stops, Angelo's Pizzeria, Groceria Italia, Merante's Gifts and Donateli's. While on the tour we learned about the different architecture of the area including dental crown molding and the beautiful St. Joseph's Church.\n\nThe first stop, Angelo's Pizzeria served us some delicious cheese pizza. (I will be back soon!) \n\nThe second stop, Groceria Italia a cute little Italian grocery store that has been in the neighborhood for decades was my favorite stop. The fact that they make all of their pasta, sausages and meats by hand is a plus during a time when most things are made by machines. While there we got to meet \""Momma\"" and sample some homemade meatballs and pasta, outstanding!\n \nThe third stop, Merante's Gifts is a cozy little store that sells Italian among other home decor items. It's the perfect store to find trinkets for your Nana. Maria, the owner who also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs served us some tasty iced coffee in the kitchen where she does her classes. We also each got a amazing dessert while back in the gift shop.\n\nThe fourth and final stop of the walking tour was Donateli's, a Italian grocery store similar to Groceria Italia. The main difference between the two is that Donateli's pasta is not homemade and is supplied from another company. While there we got to try a orange and chocolate biscotti and see the \""back of house\"" machines.\n\nThe Brewery portion was nice also. We got to sample three different beers. I don't drink beer so I can't really say they were all that good. Jake really knows the history of beer in Pittsburgh. The only bad thing that happened was the shuttle bus that dropped us off at Church Brew Works left us stranded and we had to wait for him to come back. Not Jake's fault.\n\nThanks Rachel for another great event."
2,Can't beat the 99 cent Bloody Mary's in the morning. We had a super bar tender that made ours extra spicy. The mexican breakfast was delicious.
2,Its good not the best but still good none the less. Lunch Specials are good and cheap. Go for lunch skip dinner.
4,Had an inspection done recently for a home I am buying in Scottsdale. I was so happy I chose this company. I met the inspector at the home and he was so helpful and knowledgeable  (his name was Tom). I'm a single mom and know nothing about home problems and repairs. Tom went thru his entire inspection and several pictures. He told me which items were concerns and which items were typical. When he finished my realtor and I knew exactly what we needed to ask the seller to do. Tom also gave me a list of repair people who could do some improvements. Overall I was very happy with his service and knowledge. I feel so much better knowing what the existing problems were and who could  take care  of some things I wanted done. Very helpful and professional. Great service great experience.
0,"The women who answered the phone was extremely unprofessional. I am a cash patient was in need of an appointment first off I asked if they where accepting new patients, she spoke so fast I could not understand her.... Then she tells me she can barely here me and that I must be on a cell phone with a tone that was just rude! So I politely apologized to her and move to another location... She then says well I can here you a little better, she then asks me if I have insurance I told her that I do not and then asked how much it would be for an appointment. She put me on hold with out telling me she was doing so and kept picking up asking me if I was being helped?????? Who does that???? I kept saying I think so? She then comes back on the phone 5 mins later and says ohhh your holding for the cash question right?? Yes!! She then told me it would be $2600 for the first visit and I would have to bring $1000 WTH I hung up on her... She treated me as if I was a horrible person because I pay cash for my appointments my job doesn't offer health benefits and I can not afford them on my own nor can I get state assistance because I make to much? Catch 22 for me but I am healthy and haven't been bothered by this before today this was such a terrible experience that I had to write this review I would not recommend calling this place let alone give then my cash. I do hope that they send that women to some type of training or that they hire someone else because she will drive your business away regardless if they are cash patients or insured..."
1,Food was lackluster. Service was slow and unorganized.  Typical Vegas over-priced.  The only redeeming quality is the view of the Bellagio fountains.
2,"Concord Mills constantly amazes me, and not just because it's the #1 tourist destination in NC, but because there are so dang many people there all the time (which I guess does contribute to that fact). It's like every time I go there, they have added another lane to some road or another. I guess those people have to get in (or out) somehow.\n\nAnyway, if I were going to visit Best Buy most times, I probably would not go to Best Buy at Concord Mills. But I happened to be there for some other reason, so we popped over, and you know what? It wasn't too bad. At least I wasn't seeing those ladies who have decided to wait 22 days to get a TV for $200.\n\nThe staff her is oddly hands-off, even more so than most Best Buy places, but that's a good thing - I don't like them to get too much into my face as I'm looking for stuff I can't afford. At least they give you a pretty convenient entrance to get in and out without having to mess with the rest of the mall traffic all that much."
4,"Everyone already knows how awesome Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook \""real\"" food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.\n\nHowever, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. \n\nNow drop everything and order this curry!\n\nAnd order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too."
4,"A great find.  One of our new favorites, the Santa Fe style food here is some of the best to be found in the valley.  The atmosphere inside is quite charming and our server was attentive and friendly.  Highly recommended."
1,"The idea is great and what inevitably will get you to try Oink Cafe.  The hostess staff and most employees seem to have better things to do than be at work.  I ordered the BLT.  It is listed as one of their specialties. The waitstaff asked what type of bacon I wanted as they offer eight flavors.  I stated Applewood, but changed my mind and said, bring whatever you recommend.  The BLT came out in three layers of blah wheat bread.  I'm pretty sure it was a 99 cent loaf of bread and the bacon had no flavor at all.  The manager came around and asked how our lunch was, I told him it was okay.  He said just ok and I told him my thoughts; the meal was rather bland.  He said, hopefully, they can impress better my next visit.  They won't have that opportunity.  Where we can order bacon everything from specialty store, don't eat here if you want some Jimmy Dean packaged bacon."
2,"Ordered delivery my first night in town.\nLoved the cheese sticks with the Garlic Butter dip. \nThe pizza was A-OK. \nIn flavor, the crust reminded me of the national pizza chain with the red white and blue logo. \nMore toppings that that chain. \nI woudl pick Toppers over that other chain."
0,"I've consistently found things that were either expired, about to expire, or have their expiration date completely erased with acetone to the point where I stopped shopping here. They profit from buying in bulk near-expired products from LA and flipping it here where competition is near zilch. Though it's closer to my home, I'd rather drive twice the distance to Lee Lee's where the turnover rates are higher and their selection more diverse. Nevertheless, this will not deter me from flying Asiana airlines."
4,This store was great with great customer service! The employee recommended good phones and features and was very knowledgeable. I recommend this store to anyone!
1,"The strawberry shaved snow lacked flavor, but the mango was pretty good. There's a decent amount of variety of toppings too. However, the guy working there gave terrible customer service (that's why this is 2 stars instead of 3). He was not friendly at all, and asked me close the door with attitude when the customer after me left it open. Never even got a thank you or a smile the entire visit. He gave me the bowl dripping and sticky with syrup. Overall, the desert was good but the attitude would keep me from wanting to come back."
1,They are a nice alternative to Zimbrick in Madison is you have a foreign car.  However I would recommend Zimbrick as the mechanics at Zimbrick will tell you what items you can do yourself to save money.  Look out at Dunn's as they may try to add on additional services that you don't really need which will cost you more money.
1,"I came to this place with a friend, who raves about this place so I was excited to finally try it after all the hype that is was given on behalf of my friend. Sadly to say, I have had better pizza at a similar type restaurant to Cibo. The pizza that I had was soggy and had no flavor. I was very disappointed and do not believe that pizza should be eaten with a knife and fork. The only thing I liked was the dessert, which was the nutella crepe. I will never come pack here and stick to my favorite urban pizzaria, which is La Bocca in Tempe."
3,Sweet potato tots are great. Burger was good as well.
4,"5 stars by far place is super busy but worth the wait! Food is great staff is friendly, and accommodating. Seating area is small but the kitchen is open to watch them cook. First  and only hawaiian bbq place I'll eat at. If you are picky like me it's a big step to try it but I wasn't disappointed!"
1,"If the food is marginal you would at least expect the service to be exceptional. It isn't. \n\nI'll put up with decent service for great food or decent food for great service, but when you don't get either one what's the point in going?"
0,"Cheese sauce.  Not cheese, cheese sauce.  Burnt carne asada and pink Carne asada in the same burrito. They couldn't even make my daughter's quesadilla properly.  This place is to be avoided."
1,"What the hell? I just stood in line for 15 minutes for the value food items, got 2 hot dogs & a popcorn. $1.50 each. This adds up to $4.50. Somehow I got charged $7.50. I had started eating my popcorn while I was waiting for the girl to fetch my hot dogs and I thought maybe she had given me the larger size. But the person behind me got the same size. So wtf?? Anyway, I wasn't given a receipt so I didn't have any way of knowing what I was charged for. I was tired of waiting and wanted to go watch the game. Except even now I'm writing a review instead of watching the diamondbacks get their ass beat. Whatever. Too late. I'm just pissed. Screw you Chase Field."
1,We finally came here for dinner but we were disappointed. There wasn't alot to choose from and it's quite expensive. The service was fine and the food was pretty decent but we expected a very different menu and a larger one at that. Plus their prices were way too much. I doubt we'd be back.
0,"Their lack of service really outweighed the quality of their food, so for that I am giving them one star (I wish I could give none).\n\nThe waitresses thoroughly pissed both me and my bf off. First of all, we were the first people to go into the restaurant at 11am. Once we entered, they looked over at us from the bar and I said \""hello\"" with a smile on my face, which was quickly turned into a scowl after they just stared at us without responding. We just stood their for 5 minutes while they kept on talking to each other at the bar. Then FINALLY one of them comes up to us and says \""yes, what can i help you with?\"" \""um, we're here for breakfast\"" is what we said. Then she told us to sit in the front without even bringing us over to a table. \n\nWe picked out what we wanted fairly quickly. We both got Cuban style breakfasts which were $8.95 each (pretty overpriced for what you get). My plate consisted of some plantains, two potato balls, two pieces of toast, and eggs....for $8.95. Which reminds me that they totally screwed up on my order. I ordered scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered his over easy. They brought us our plates (after about 20 minutes of waiting even though we were the only customers) and both plates had over easy eggs. I didn't even bother complaining because I knew it was just going to take even longer and we were on pressed time. I felt like they just did all the eggs over easy to make it simpler for themselves. \n\nMy bf finished his plate first and he scooted his empty plate to the side of the table so the waitress could see and pick it up. Instead the waitress sat some lady that just arrived to a booth next to us and started talking to her in Spanish for a while, took her order, then walked right past our table without taking the plate or giving us and refills. Shortly after that, I finished my plate of food. At that point there were TWO empty plates at the side of the table and TWO empty cups next to them. It really ticked me off to see the waitress bring the lady's order out right away, talk to her some MORE, then pass our table ONCE AGAIN without doing anything. We were literally sitting there doing nothing. \n\nThe waitress went to the lady's table again to talk to her some more and that's when my boyfriend asked her for the bill, then she asked us if we wanted some refills and took our plates. If that's what it takes to get refills and a clean table at this place then that's just ridiculous.\n\nShe came out with not our bill, but the bill for the lady in the booth next to us. WTF that really got us mad! That lady next to us arrived about 30 minutes after we arrived.  We asked for the bill ONCE AGAIN and she brought it out along with the other lady's change. My bf slammed his card on the bill right away cuz we were not in the mood to wait any longer. \n\nAs we waited for the waitress to bring us the receipt I noticed all the other waitresses just standing around the bar DOING NOTHING BUT TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR. That's probably what they do all day long since the bar has a wall made up of mirrors. It was so annoying, there was about 5 other waitresses and not one of them could give us good service. I noticed one of the waitresses made a stripper outfit out of her uniform. All of her tramp stamp tattoos were showing since she rolled her shirt up and she was wearing hoochi shorts, I found it very unprofessional. \n\nOur receipt finally came. I begged my bf not to give a tip, unfortunately he did lol, but it was only 5 percent. They really deserved less considering they neglected the hell out of us . \n\nI don't know if it was because of the way we looked (my bf has dreads and I have a nose piercing) but the service was just horrible and it seemed like it was only like that for us. Either way, no establishment should be run like this. \n\nWe still want to try the Cuban buffet and we plan on doing so next week. Luckily with buffets you go and get your own food, so we won't be needing much of their services. I guess then I'll be able to post something about their food. That is, if they don't make a black cloud hover over it with their service."
1,"I'm always cautious when visiting a place in its first few days of operation, but my trepidation over visiting FIZZ was overruled by my desire for a great glass of bubbly. \n\nAs a solo drinker I found a seat rather quickly, but service was slow - the place WAS packed, though. Their champagnes by the glass menu was extensive, but also expensive when compared to my regular haunts like Laguna at Venetian. And honestly, for the price, I think Guy Savoy offers better selection. \n\nI finally settled on a mid priced glass, and then waited, and waited...and waited. I finally saw my server pop the cork on the bottle herself. Odd the bartenders couldn't find the time to pour a single glass, but they seemed to be busy filling cocktail orders, probably due to the 2 for 1 coupons everyone had. \n\nMy drink came out, and I asked for the bill right away anticipating a wait, even though the space is cool and the people watching was ridiculous. The music is not really suitable to the chic space and is a bit too loud, but perhaps I'm sounding much older than my age by saying that. The crowd seemed to be upper 30s to mid 40s, it's kind of like a club for those who don't like clubs. \n\nThe bill came out quite quickly. I was surprised to see a built in 18% gratuity and some unidentified service fee, but I paid my $36 bill (yikes) with $40 and then waited for my change - which never came, even after 10 minutes of waiting. I couldn't find my server, either. Well played. \n\nWill likely get my bubble fix elsewhere in the future."
0,You pay a fee to get in. You pick your own parts then they charge you gold prices for used steel. I wanted 2 brackets & the price started at a rediculous $75. I bawked & the price dropped 2 more times. I still ended up paying way too much for sum lousy brackets. I inquired about some other parts I wanted and for a couple bucks more I should just buy brand new with a warranty. Crazy huh!!!
3,"Solid little sit down spot, when you feel like dining in for some decent food but want something better than a fast food joint.\n\nI've had the steak burger, a little thin on the patty, but great flavor and prepared well.\n\nThe chili cheese dog was ok and the chicken tenders are solid.\n\nCustard was pretty good, think it's something that I'll have to get used to.\n\nNow to my favorite item, the chili cheese fries, they're awesome.  Great tasting chili with nacho cheese sauce on the top of some shoestring fries. Could eat just those for a meal, great portion size.\n\nStaff is great. Saw manager and assistant manager walking through bussing the tables and checking on  customers.\n\nIt's a \""go to\"" spot for me."
3,"Stopped out to Stage Door the other night, and had a blast!\nService was outstanding, enough to earn an additional star.\nBrittany, the bar tender we had, is awesome.  Every time I've been in and she's been working, she's smiling.  I don't think I've ever not seen her smile.\n\n$4 shots of patron?  YES PLEASE.  The glass was salted, with a lime.  Delicious!\n\nGreat Job Stage Door! :)"
3,"When I take my family to Vegas they get together and look up Vegas buffets to try. We got an all day passes for the Las Vegas Flamingo, Paris, Harris, and 4 other hotels for 49.00 a person for a 24 hour pass with Totalrewards. If you purchase the All Day Pass at dinner time you can have Breakfasts, Lunch and Dinner the next day a good deal you think but for 4 people that's $218.00 dollars with tax. My family wanted to stay an extra couple of days so we found a good rate at The Rio. hotel. Out of all the Buffets we went to the Carnival World Buffet was the best experience and it was not even close. I have stayed at the Rio before and have always loved this buffet. They have a very large section and they have sea food too. I will say that for years this Buffet would have always gotten 5 stars from me but this last time it just seemed that it as gone down just a little but I can't put my finger on what it is. Buffets have become so high in price and there are so many Buffets in Vegas now the Rio may have let there buffet slip just a little. With that being said I still think this buffet is in the top 5 of buffets in Vegas."
2,"Very good breakfast, so-so service\n\nStopped in with the fam and enjoyed their breakfast.  Waffles with Cherries and Italian Omlette were especially good.  Nice bakery for take-home goods, as well.\n\nTwo kocks: (1) Service was very slow.  Tony had more to converse about with the lady in the service window that to attend to us.  Left waiting about 12 minutes to order and about 15 minutes to pay, after finishing.  (2) OJ is $5 a cup.  I know it's the desert, but really?"
0,"In hindsight, I wish I researched this before booking. As things turned out, my experience is NOT an isolated incident with this business if you research other travel sites. \n\nMany of our family members booked a mini family vacation here for a July weekend several months in advance DIRECTLY from their web site. After getting a confirmation and putting down a deposit($230/night) for our reservation, we thought that everything was set. What else could go wrong?\n\nWhen we arrived around 3pm check in time after tired 9hr drive. My heart sank after they informed me that we no longer have a room because they were overbooked(was a busy weekend, boxing event). Now why on earth would you continue to book people for the hotel rooms when you know you ran out of rooms!!! Isn't it suppose to be first come first serve?  When you don't have enough rooms to rent out for a particular day, aren't you suppose to stop booking more people! \n\nAs I later learned, we weren't the only people that have this problem on that day. I overhear many other guests that were just as pee off  as we were after getting bump from the hotel. \n\nAfter pleading with them to provide us a room(didn't care if its down or up scale) so we can stay with the family without staying 3 miles away from the strip, they still wouldn't give us our room. All they told us was that they were sold out and the typical customer service talk. The only thing they did was give us some taxi money and transferred our stay to their sister hotel Mirage(also owned by MGM) for a complimentary stay and refunded us the deposit. \n\nIn hindsight, I suspect that they bumped us because there were more people willing to pay for a higher rate that busy weekend. So obviously if they pay more, that'd be more $$ for the hotel. Just weeks before I went, I often checked the price of the rooms and noticed that the rate gone up by 50%+. So it sounds to me that the highest bidder wins.  \n\nWhat ever happen to  business integrity? Back in the days when you get a confirmation after making a deposit, its pretty much a done deal that you'll get your room.   If you don't mind rolling the dice, book this place at your own risk because of a confirmation don't mean anything.\n\nIn the future, I'll have 2nd thought about staying at any MGM properties. Definitely Mandalay Bay is no longer a place I'd stay. \n\nGood luck to all that plans to stay at this place."
3,"I needed a quick lunch while buzzing around Phoenix. I have heard a lot of good things about Zoe's and since I was there,I thought I would give it a go!\nParking can be tight, at lunch time at least. Lots of people have the same idea.\nI got a simple lunch,but it was very good.\nLimeade was my drink of choice, quite good and they say sweetend with Cane sugar.\nI got the Zoe Club Pita. Was fresh tatsing as good.\nChicken, Ham ,and swiss cheese, with lettuce ,tomato and some spicy mustard, I asked for extra spice.\nNot a bad experiance at all. The place is clean and modern looking."
3,"This place has a little vegetarian section on their menu!  There are four entrees to choose from. I got this one: Berenjena Rellena: Stuffed eggplant with fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach and cheese, served with Spanish saffron rice.  It was really good! We had a large group (about 10 or us), and service was great. I tried a mixed drink: MIRO MARTINI- Malibu Rum, Stoli Orange & pineapple juice with a splash of Blue Curacao. It was so strong I couldn't drink it. Now the dessert, oh man, I would go back just for dessert. I got the Tres Leches. and it was a HUGE portion, and the best I would ever have."
0,"I should washed my car with newspaper that had been prepped for paper mache... I would have had less spots afterward.  I feel like they add calcium or something to the water.  Theoretically this was convenient, but there is a reason why people pay for a quality wash."
3,"Love love love their desserts! I can eat their desserts everyday if they weren't that pricey. I've tried their raspberry macaroon and carrot cake. They were absolutely TO DIE FOR. They were tasty yet still light. I'd definitely go back every now and then when I need a treat! Their coffee/latte are pretty pricey too, expect at least 4 bucks for a cup of hot latte. The only negative thing about this place is the staff aren't that friendly and for the price you pay for the desserts, I expect full service than self-serve."
0,Not sure what the hype is all about. Based on some of the other reviews I called  in to order the Grilled Pork Sandwich ahead of time.  I was told it would take about 20 minutes.   This  establishment looked rather filthy.  The one and only table there had not been wiped down.   Nothing to brag about.  The pork was lacking in flavor and I don't see anything special about the roll.    Sandwich was cold and sodas from the fridge were not.
4,"Great spot for the atmosphere, and absolutely fantastic coffee. The Food is wonderful. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Wasted money. So getting a pedicure is something I get done 4 times a year because I need to. Not want. I've been going to the same place for years and they always do a great job while criticizing my feet. Today they did a half ass job and refused to finish it properly. They still charged me and my feet look almost the same as when I went in. I wasted money that I don't really have on something I needed for health reasons. I'll never go there again.
2,"Oxtail chili cheese fries\n-my friends raved about the Oxtail fries so I thought I would give it a shot. The fries were not bad, needs a little kick of spiciness, chili could be better. \n\nHad the Mr. Miyaki. Def better than the first time I was here and got the ronin burger, but I still don't see how this place gets the reviews that it does. \n\nI know their concept is Asian fusion but instead of just incorporating the sweet elements from Asian cuisine they should more of the spice elements from Asian cuisine. Most their dishes here are just too sweet."
0,"Unethical billing practices.  Prices more than double area dentists for same procedure(s).  Billing office initially refused to bill our insurance for procedure until I called the insurance company and had them contact Tatum Creek to inform them that as a provider they are required to bill every procedure.  Even after they were paid in full, they then continuously kept billing our insurance company for the procedure they had already been paid in full for.  Once again I had to call the insurance company to file complaint.  Also, the staff is rude -- when we initially had billing questions, they would never return our calls.  Regarding dental care, Dr. Lamborn blew off an issue my husband had, telling him that it was fine and could wait, but when he went to a different dentist, they told him that it was an urgent issue and could not wait.  Tatum Creek Family Dentistry -- WORST dental experience ever!!!"
2,A little too dark but still a nice place. Forgot what drink I ordered but it was tasty. Its a small  setting and good for small group of friends to have a few drinks. Very relaxed atmosphere.
4,"The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc\u00e9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  \n\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \""curry-like\"" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \n\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back."
4,"The security of this community always takes great care of us. 24/7 patrolling our streets. The actual community center is located right next to the school. That's how you know even our kids are safe. And when you need help, they come right away! This entire neighborhood is peaceful and the people here are friendly. I love that there are trails that run in-between and all through out this neighborhood. and there's long roads instead of street patches. That way when the day comes for me to finally wake up early enough, I can actually jog. If I'd want to live anywhere in Summerlin, it would be right here in this neighborhood. It's right in the heart of everything good in Summerlin."
4,"If you go here, you will never bother with Starbucks again! I'm not a frufru overly sugary coffee drinker so I was pleasantly pleased with the 8+ different beans/roasts that were availble. They have all their beans in jars on the counter so you can see and smell them to decide which one you would like brewed. They also sell their beans by the bag to take home. I went with the lighter roast called Zoom, half and half and an equal packet. DELISH. I am excited to try others next time. You can of course add sweetened flavor shots if you want. I was also excited to see that they brew every cup to order. \n\nThey pastries looked to die for. I went with a chocolate muffin and it was excellent. Very rich though. I had a tough time eating the whole thing over a few hours. Ladies, it's def a pms killer ;) \n\nThe set up was very homey with lots of reading material. Large leather couches, game area for the kiddies, and a fully stocked book shelf. They staff was friendly and chatted with all of the customers. There were only 3 of us in there, the other 2 customers were obviously regulars. I felt nice to see the staff knowing the other clients by name. I can't help but support the small business, mom and pop type places. I will definitely be back soon!"
1,"I had the pleasure of eating at Mesa Grill in the Bahamas and enjoyed ever bite. The food was spectacular and the steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service was also a top notch experience. \n\nNow on to Vegas:\nWhile on a mini family vacation (cheer tournament) in Vegas with my wife and kids I thought it would be great for the family to enjoy what I had the opportunity to enjoy in Bahamas. After checking yelp and calling ahead to see when Mesa closed we promptly arrived at 10:30. After hustling my kids by the questionable statues in Caesars the Romans call art. Did I also mention that we passed Nobu's and Rao's on our way to Mesa. All because I thought my family would enjoy what I fell in love with in the Bahamas.  \n\nAfter being greeted by the receptionist she politely informed me that the Resturant was closed for the night (Saturday) and all of waiters that could serve us were let go early. I asked her politely is there anyway that someone could serve us because my family and I traveled 400 miles just to eat at Mesa grill. She politely smiled and said no. At this time my family was hunger crabby and looked at me like \""we should have stopped at some sub par Resturant on the strip\"". After walking away defeated like I just climbed Mount Rushmore with no one to greet me at the top I walked outside with my family and reviewed the hours of operation that said \""Mesa grill closes at 11pm\"". I then walked back into the restaurant and asked again politely to someone standing by the polite hostess and they finally said OK. \n\nBobby if your reading this.... I love your food that much to walk back in the same Resturant that turned away my family of five away before official closing hours. \n\nThank goodness for the second hostess/ manager who seated us. In addition the food was spectacular and the service was incredible. The server saved the day for me. Just couldn't believe that the hostess was ready to turn away a $450 check."
3,"Delicious crepes, at least the vanilla bean custard and strawberry one! Busy place on Saturday morning so a long wait for our food but good. My husband and I each ordered the vanilla and strawberry crepe which was delicious but we were both still a little hungry afterward. Will order more next time! Great neighborhood vibe."
0,"The establishment opens at 5:00 PM, I get there at 5:20ish and the lady at the booth says \""We are closed for a private event\"" and then asked me to come back at 7:00 PM. Honestly, no point in rating this any higher as they didn't bother reserving open seats for general people. \n\nThey didn't even bother changing the giant sign on their podium that said \""Opens at 5:00 PM\"""
2,"Blue lemon is a real cute place, the decor is great, love their little coffee bar area! I ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken it was yummy and light!  I would go again!"
1,This is an OK place to go and hang out with some friends after work and maybe get some chips and salsa. I went there for dinner and it's basically what you'd expect from a chain Mexican restaurant. I was not impressed. There are much better places to go if you are in the mood for Mexican food.
1,"With Yelp as our guiding light in all things food and drink this place provides one of the most divided selections of reviews that I've seen on the site. To justify my two meagre stars:\n\nYay!\n- big range of whiskies\n- central location\n- appealing decor\n\nNope\n- service is so slow\n- seriously, haven't they picked up the message - people are WAITING!\n- I had a straight whisky, though friends had a cocktail that they failed to finish as it just wasn't very nice, which is something of a failing in a cocktail that you've paid a fair whack for\n\nSo, if you're in the city and looking for a drink - particularly an unusual or exclusive whisky - then this is just the place for you, so long as it's just about empty."
3,"Well, it was a surprise!  Some reviews said that the food quality was very poor and such, quite a contrast actually.  \nThe food was good (chicken tikka, chicken curry, aloo tikki, aloo gobhi, chhole, dal makhani).  The dessert section had kheer (rice pudding) and gulab jamun.  The chicken curry was good and the naan was soft.  The aloo tikki was nothing special and I did not try the vegetarian items as I was full.  \nFor $9.62 including tax this was a good place.  They even had lassis and fountain drinks but I didn't try it.  They do take credit cards too so that helps travelers like me.  I'd have given it a 3.5 stars rather than a 4 but 4 it is!"
2,"Just tried this place out yesterday as I've been looking for a good Chinese buffet in the area. I just moved here a few months ago and wanted to compare it to places back home. I'm giving a solid 3 stars.\n\nThis is probably the largest Chinese buffet I've been to. You pay upfront, so our lunch for 2 cost just over $22 with drinks, not including tip. Did not have to wait to be seated since they were on the ball about that. We were served our drinks right away and headed to the food. Our waitress was friendly. She came to our table about 3 times during our meal (for each refill we had on our drinks). \n\n\nMy favorite selection was definitely the jalapeno chicken. It was way spicier than I had assumed it would be, so it was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. It definitely blew the other chicken out of the water. Most of the others I tried were somewhat bland. Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.\n\nI'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed. \n\nThe beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it. \n\nThey have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed. The pudding was cold and the ice cream was fine. \n\nI rate it 3 stars simply for the jalapeno chicken and friendly wait staff. Being seated quickly and the waitress keeping up on our refills. Other than that, it was pretty mediocre. I've been to way better Chinese buffets back home in Illinois, so it's nothing too special for my taste buds."
2,"I returned to Bottles and Burgers for the third time. My first first was opening week and they clearly had some wrinkles to iron out. I asked the bartender \""why the reference to the double helix?\"" Not one of the 3 bartenders could answer. I am still waiting for an answer. The Happy Hour Blazin sliders are incredible, Angus beef with an avocado and bacon. Yum!. Two slliders for $4.00. We also ordered the pulled pork sliders and  the Italian meatball sliders. The pork was great but the Meatballs were BORING. Although the lobster roll was not on Happy Hour, $12.00 we thought we would try it.  Stay away clear of this big piece of bread with some type of mixture and mayonnaise!!   The service was unforgettable;not horrible but no ne is very friendly. When in the mood for  a beef burger -hit Happy hour 4-7pm."
2,"The Chandler location is located in a strip mall.  Strike one.\nThe decoration of the Chandler location looks very ...80's? Strike two. (  I don't know how to describe it.  The Havana Cafe's Chandler location just doesn't look modern or even retro; the interior just looked outdated.)\n\nThey got on base with the food.  We ordered \""Tostones\"", which are twice fried plantains with a mojo garlic sauce and an order of Empanaditas for the appetizers for four of us.    Both were satisfying.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered Pollo Cubano, chicken breast in light curry, lime, and garlic with sauteed sweet onions on top.   The winner at the table was the Gallina Frita, shredded chicken breast, pan fried with onions laced with a garlic sauce.   Can't decide from all the choices that sound good on the menu?  Do as my husband did and order the Dinner Sampler and try a variety.   At the end, we were too stuffed to try desert.  (Well, for the record, everyone else was too stuffed.  I would have been game to try something, but I didn't want to look like a pig :)\n\nI thought the food was good, but a overpriced for the meal.  Our service was spot on and attentative, but as the other reviews seemed to indicate, and our friends feedback validated, the service can be spotty.\n\nI say - try the place out.  We would definately go back."
4,Just found out they serve tacos. They were really good! Pleasantly surprised. I will definitely be back for more.
4,"Open until 2AM!!\n\nPhoenix for some reason is lacking on late night dining. This is why I give Delux gets five stars. The food amazing and ambiance up-to-date, open until 2AM seven day a week."
4,Idk if they had seen a dirtier car than the one I just dropped off for a full detail. Curtis and Kevin teamed up and did an outstanding job couldn't b happier! Great customer service thanks again guys
1,"I didn't try the food to rate that so this is based on the service.  Honestly, I'd rather give them one star but the second is for the fact that they actually gave us tea when we sat down.\n\nWalked in and it wasn't busy at all, there were waiters standing around, and none were attentive at all.  We sat there with the menu for what felt like quite a while, even when we tried to call someone over to take our order nobody came.  So being hungry and no longer patient to tolerate the lack of service, we walked out and went upstairs to eat instead.  \n\nI highly doubt I'll ever step into this restaurant again.  To those who do go, good luck!"
2,"The food is good,a bit on the pricy side for just pasta. I wished they had revised there menu to make it more healthier overall. Very heavy on the calories, which makes me want to visit only once every few months."
2,"The Light Group are pros and whether it's David Christian or anyone else on the team, I've never heard them spin a bad set. But if Justin Timberlake and Andy Sandberg were acting like jerks here, they'd be dicks in a box, because this place is basically a small box. And it's hard for a box to compete with ultra-lux poolside nightclubs like Tao and XS.\n\n*** in LV, but would be  **** in NY or Miami and ***** anywhere else in the U.S."
4,"Just ate lunch here today and my husband and I were really blown away! I got a carne Asada taco and a carne Asada mini taco and the husband got two al pastor tacos. Just FYI the \""mini tacos\"" are not mini, they're standard size street tacos and the \""tacos\"" are huge and loaded with all the fixin's; whole seasoned pinto beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, etc. So good!!! I tried my husbands al pastor meat and it was addictively good! Sweet and rich in flavor. We also ordered aqua frescos (I think that's what they're called, the fruit juice drinks) and I've never had anything more refreshing! The manager Greg let me get two flavors so I had pineapple and mango! Amaaaaaazing!! Everyone was very friendly too. The manager even walked to our table and took the time to talk with us and was so kind and welcoming. Very incredible service, has a very family feel to it. Definitely plan to come back whenever I'm in Vegas and try their nachos, fries and maybe a burrito too and recommend you try this place."
3,"Let me just start off by saying... I ADORE THIS PLACE. Everything about this place, I love. I love that they do not have plastic bags and only carry paper brown bags. I love their healthy selections, their incredible produce department , their beautiful flowers that they have year round.. And all of their products. Here are some of my favorite things: Indian veggie burgers- these are incredible, potato like burgers with a slight hint if curry; they go perfectly with trader joes Mango chutney- which is also incredible. I love their tangerine juice, it's such a nice unique twist on orange juice and super sweet. Trader joes unsweetened vanilla almond milk is the best almond milk I can find. Their meatless mandarin orange chicken is my FAVORITE. I buy it by the dozen. Trader joes is the cheapest place for healthier options like quinoa, coconut milk ice cream and meatless options too. Their meatless ground beef is my favorite. They have amazing customer service and will take back anything if you have your receipt. I have tried a lot of their dried fruits and I bought dried peaches once and hated them- they took them back without even blinking. The only item that I do not prefer from trader joes is their meat items- my boyfriend loves their rib eye, but considering they do not have a butcher on the site, I do not buy their meat.. I don't know how fresh it is and therefore I do not trust it. That's the only reason they have not received 5 stars from me.. I love trader joes overall and it's a must for my biweekly grocery shopping sprees."
3,"Never tried Kombucha before....this is the perfect place for you.  The owners open the tap room every Sunday from 2-8 to the public.  When I say tap room I mean a small room with a table a few chairs, a couch and a tv where they keep 3 different flavors of Kombucha on tap.  If it is your first time trying or you are a seasoned vet who home brews there own it is a great place to learn about kombucha and the way lenny boy brews theirs.   The owners are super friendly and certainly love sharing about the product that they pour.  You are welcome to sample all of the flavors on tab or just get a glass of one or even buy a growler to take some home (I now have 2 of my own cause I have become Kombuchalioc) all for reasonable prices.  They are now certified organic and use all north carolina ingrediants (unless unavailable in our great state).  This is also a great product for anyone doing a raw diet as they cold brew their tea.  I have only been here during the winter but there have been talks that as the weather begins to warm up they will be having live music and more outside in their parking lot which will make for a great relaxing afternoon.  Come check it out!!"
2,"Decent meal, nothing spectacular but not as horrible as everyone seems to be making it out to be. I would encourage everyone to at least give it a try. Anytime a new restaurant opens there are bound to be a few issues to work out. I had the fish and chips, hubby had the grilled chicken sandwich. Average Maricopa food."
0,"A lousy hot dog stand with expensive beer.\nFour of us went for lunch Sunday. Server was great, but service was slow because she had tables outside and we were inside. Ordered brats and they were severely overlooked and bad. The spicy one was so bad that it was hard all the way thru. The cook ought to go to Ted's to see how good brats are cooked!\nTried Belgian Fries and they were so overcooked that they were black brown in color and totally crispy.\nDraft beer was almost warm and very expensive. \nFood was very expensive too.\nFood served was cool, probably because it came from a building next door. We were in bar.\nBill for 4 lunches and a couple of beers was over $160.\nMy summary: A BAD HOT DOG STAND, OVERLY EXPENSIVE, WITH SOME GOOD BEERS ON TAP...BUT WARM.\nWill never go back."
3,"I guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60% full which can be understandable. But we were seated within 5 minutes, but the menus took another 5 minutes to come.\nI ordered the 4 course of salad, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, banana bread pudding, and a chai latte included in the end. Chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree. Bread pudding very very good to finish. The gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side. Main entrees were a bit on the smaller side.\nThe server was joking around a little, calling my chicken KFC when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard. Funny guy."
4,"i've been making my way through the cheaper mexican restaurants around town for years and was just introduced to this place- I hope I'll never have to go anywhere else.  The tiny, rustic atmosphere makes you feel like you just left madison and wandered into mexico accidentally and the enormous delicious portions are so cheap- exactly the kind of unique experience that makes this place stand out."
0,"One star because this place, during summer and during happy hour, could be tolerable for a very short time, other than that ----- Run Away!!!\n\nThe have the worst music mix on a Friday night.  It's ghetto-fabulous rap and crappy Bon Jovi (the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to Living on a Prayer I swear).  \n\n$9 mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better, I feel like such a winner paying 3 x regular price of a regular drink.  $ 4 Coronas.\n\nI saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy, nice. \n\nOne out of two had fake breasts.   Seriously, I counted.\n\nI entertained myself by watching the ladies in 3-4\"" heels sink into the sand, and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink. Classy.\n\nWhat Scottsdale stereotype's? ----------Yeah right."
4,"Loved this place!\n\nI went for lunch after my graduation.  We went for a very late lunch so it was dead, which was fine with me.  We had a great server, who was accomodating and friendly.  The mac and cheese was SO GOOD, definitely get that if you go.  We also had the grilled artichokes.. very yummy.\n\nEveryone's lunch was good, and I thought was really reasonably priced for 5 people (3 ordered the kobe burgers, a bottle of champagne, and two appetizers) when the total came out to $115 bucks.\n\nThey also provided a free celebration dessert, which was such a nice personal touch.\n\nFood = yummy, decor = adorable, service = excellent."
1,Big rooms. Needs updating. Carpets were stained and torn in places.  Smelled a little musty. Pool overlooks an ally and dirty street. Room service slow. And they don't respond for hours if u need anything.  Service could have been better for the amount of money you pay. Overall an ok place to stay. But it's Vegas!!  There are hundreds of hotels to choose from. Why settle for less!
1,"I read a review that their Philly cheesesteak was similar to Chicago's style... I highly disagree! The hotdog that my toddler ate was disgusting. The potato skins were ok. Although, the suicide wings were great. (but the hotness was more of a medium heat not suicide) The service was extremely slow but friendly staff. I don't see myself dining in but maybe I will do a take out on wings and try their pizza."
0,"Terrible, terrible, terrible! Don't believe the ad that advertises 5 rooms for $19.75...it is a scam! First thing the technician did was tell me how bad my house smelled and how awful my carpet looked (total exaggeration). NICE HUH! Then he proceeded to quote us a total of $273.00 to clean our smelly, awful carpet. We ended up agreeing on $70.00 and boy do I regret it! Well if my house had a slight smell before it was now 100 times worse...the whole house smells like wet, soggy, stale carpet...and that was with the deodorizer...I had my carpet cleaned 4 months ago by a different more reliable company and by the time they left my house  it smelled wonderful and fresh and clean! I only went with AZ carpet, upholstery and air duct  because of there advertisement. When I called to complain all they could tell me is that they would come and do a re-do...NO THANKS! My carpet is already soggy enough! I want a REFUND!"
4,"The starter they offer is fresh chips and salsa and it was AMAZING, I haven't had fresh salsa like that since I was in Texas! \n\nI would definitely suggest you visit this restaurant if you're at the NY hotel, we got the enchiladas and they were the best I'd EVER had (better than when I was in Mexico)! The menu has an excellent variety of Mexican food and the pricing is excellent for anyone on a budget. The portions are also very well sized (enough to share and be full). \n\nABSOLUTELY A MUST WHILE YOU ARE IN LV! :D"
3,"Bonne nourriture, bon service, bien situ\u00e9 belle terrasse l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Un must \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al."
2,"Dropped from 4 stars to 3 when I ordered what seemed like the normal California Burrito. Unfortunately when I got home, I found out it contained RICE instead of Fries. Who the Hell puts Rice instead of Fries in a California Burrito? What a let down!"
3,"Yumyum....i like breakfast here, seafood, ice cream, and etc. I wish they had more seafood in general such as crab/lobster/etc! Sushi wasn't that great. The chocolate was great. \nFree comps for marriott plat which saves you tons of money considering i got billed $67 for over 300 of food."
1,"Mediocre food.  Green Chili Stew recommended by staff was over done and with no chicken.  Egg rolls were flavorless.  Atmosphere is good, fast service."
3,Great tasting steakburgers and delicious frozen custard...My fav is Hawaian Delight Sundae or Concrete (blended)
0,"A group of 7 of us went on a Tuesday night to celebrate our friend's birthday. It was a disaster from the beginning. The waitress neglected to ask the birthday girl what she wanted to drink. She also failed to notice that one of our guests had accidentally spilled his soda and commented to the spiller \""wow! you're really sucking those down let me grab you another one\"" and left him in a wet mess. Out of all 7 of us, only the birthday girl's entree was messed out [talk about some bad birthday luck!]. The salmon she ordered wasn't fully cooked! And she's not a fan of sushi... The waitress didn't apologize and just said \""oh, i'll take it to the kitchen so they can fix it.\"" Our birthday girl had a chat with the manager to let him know that we were a little \""miffed\"" by the [lack of] service to say the least. The manager said he would send us a new waitress and comp her uncooked salmon. We never got a new waitress and when she brought us the bill she proclaimed \""wow! for some reason my manager gave ya'll a 25% discount! you guys must be stoked!\"" ...On the way out, one of our guests overheard her telling a fellow waitress that \""I heard heroin isn't bad for you so I do it from time to time.\"" \n\nJust another example of why drugs are bad for you kids."
1,"I tried the pad thai here since that's what I always get to gauge a Thai restaurant.  The dish was slightly bland, a bit too sweet and not much else.  I did not taste any lime or cilantro, or really anything that reminded me of Pad Thai..  The price is the same as any other Thai restaurant, but I think I'd prefer any other Thai restaurant..."
0,"Service was was not good at all, the waitress took forever to have our order placed. the other people who sat around us (who were seated after) all got their orders in before me and my date, the waiter never checked on us and the food was terrible, especially the hash browns... Will not be going again."
3,Great wrap. I would return. This will probably be my new breakfast spot I take visitors.
4,"Great food , live music. Lots of fun"
2,This the second time I've eaten here. Both times the food was good. The blues band that was there was really good. I also liked the 1/2 price drinks.\n\nThe first time the service was good. The second time we came for lunch and they only had a bartender doing drinks and waiting tables. She was not overly friendly and seemed to take a long time since there were only two tables.\n\nI would recommend giving this place a try. Maybe for dinner not lunch.
3,"Since I moved to Henderson I have been desperately looking for a quality pizzeria that delivers and I think I finally found it! I have sampled several different pizzerias over the last year and Mama Depalma's is the best.  Pizza was classic NY style, good thin crust, good tasting sauce, quality cheese, baked perfectly and delivered within an hour.  I can't wait until my next order."
0,"Seven Yelpers in a row can't be wrong! We all agree on one thing...Western cab sucks! The cabbie I had a run-in with tonight was apparently just another in their collection of rude ones. Calling dispatch and seeing the way they handle (or don't handle) a road rage issue shows that behind the lousy drivers is management that is equally as bad. Like the reviewer before me said, there are many cab companies; if you get this company, just pass it up for the next one. Apparently the drivers with the road rage issues end up here, since management is tolerant of it."
4,"This is one outstanding restaurant!!! Shouldn't be missed by anyone loving interesting and different food.\nWe had a fantastic time with the whole dining experience. Great service from the moment the bar manager saw our drink order and rushed over with enthusiasm to discuss the  possibilities, to dessert.\nWe didn't get beyond the small plates. Between the four of us we ordered 9 different small plates and loved them all, interesting flavor combinations."
1,"Dr Whipple is a really good doctor, but unless you're retired and have all day to go to appointments, you might want to find another doctor.  You will never wait less than 1.5 hours, and the staff is less than friendly."
1,"I really was hoping that this coffee shop was enjoyable. The sitting area is really enjoyable and spacious, inside and outside. I was hoping to be able to come and enjoy the surroundings on nights I wish to drink coffee. \nI ordered a breve. The coffee had a very odd burnt/chemical taste. It was stingy and astringent, which are two words I have never used to describe coffee. \nThe employees are friendly, but do not expect any latte art. They do not really seem to be especially passionate, or at least, well trained in coffee prep. This shop seems to rely on the aesthetics of an upscale coffee shop (aprons and flat caps, traditional menu, classy dishware), lacking decent coffee. I couldn't even finish mine."
2,"I don't do clubs, but I liked Ghost Bar.  The people were friendly (meaning the boys were very friendly) and the view is really nice."
2,"When you think of Vegas, what do you think? Clubbing? Strippers? Gambling? Fine dining? Did you ever think about Dolphins?\n\nSo my gf and I had an extended Vegas trip and we were looking for something to do during the day time. She has always been fond of white tigers but shes never seen one in real life. So what do you do when you're an awesome bf? Take her to the secret garden!\n\nSo first off, the place is really small. Basically they have 2 exhibits, dolphins and big cats. They have about 5 dolphins here and they are quite photogenic. You can totally tell that the animals here are show animals because they love the spot light!\n\nAs for the big cats, it includes tigers, lions, and panthers. Most of the animals are nocturnal so they were sleeping but there was one extremely prima donna lion. He just kept trouncing back and forth.\n\nOverall, I prefer the shark reef over the secret garden but this place is still worth at least one visit."
0,"Have been here three times. I always end up with the same outcome,  unsatisfied. The food is extremely bland. The last incident left a horrible taste in my mouth so my family and I will NEVER be returning  \nMy husband went in to order food, the cashier thought because he was white, he didn't know Spanish. Little did she know, he's fluent. When the cashier was telling the cooks what to make, she said (in Spanish) \""I hate when gringos come in here and they don't even know what they want to order.\"" \nUnacceptable. Uncalled for. Inappropriate. \nMy husband had already paid for the food or else he would have said something. As he was walking out he says, (in Spanish) \""my ears work too\""  \nWe will never never go back there."
2,"Conspicuously, I crossed the threshold.  The varnish of the oaken door was peeling, worn away, the brassen latch-pull tarnished.  \""A table for three,\"" I said.  \""The remainder of my party will be here directly.\""  The maitre'd condescended to fix upon me a stern look.  \""I'm sorry, sir.\""  She said, her bangs bobbed in front of me.  \""We cannot seat you until everyone who will be joining you is here.  Feel free to have a seat at the bar until they arrive.\""\n\nI glanced barward.  Smart suits and ties, polished oxfords.  Where was I?  I thought to myself.  What in God's name are these people on about? \n\nI sidled up akin a middle aged woman, her dried out blonde hair had given way to brunette roots, a sprinkle of grey visible from my proximity.  She sipped a cocktail of some kind, probably some kinda vodka.  I signaled to the barkeep, asked for a whiskey;  I had a gut ache from the night before and only the hair of the dog could combat it.  \""Seven fifty\"", the barman said sliding a curled slip of white paper my direction.  I fingered around my changepurse, pulling out a handful of all I could find.  \""This is robbery,\"" I said as I tossed the money his way.\n\nThe entryway bell jingled and I looked back hoping to see my companions.  No such luck.  An elderly couple dressed like they just come from a church service stood there, the woman's yellow scarf waving in the soft breeze.  I guessed my comrades weren't gonna make it.  Maybe they'd been caught?  Or worse.  I put the thought out of my head and my mind rested easy on the sack of loot on my back and the warm sixgun by my side. You know, a guy like me could add quite a few more greenbacks to today's haul in a place like this.  My hand fell to my side."
0,"Ok, let me tell you this: ANYBODY WHO RATED THIS PLACE 5 STARS COULD NOT HAVE EATEN AT AN AUTHENTIC TAQUERIA...EVER. Because if they did, they would have easily ripped this place. I mean, c'mon, they throw some so-so carne or what they call carnitas into a tortilla, throw a pinch of cilantro & spoon a little guac and call that a taco? The carne asada was salty and I've made better carnitas in the oven. They didn't even use the \""real\"" chico tortillas and they were single, not doubled up, like every other taqueria I've ever been to in my whole life! The salsa bar was ehhh ok...I guess...But I just couldn't get over how half assed their tacos were. For a place that calls themselves a \""Taco shop\"", I expected a helluvalot more. I guess it's cool that they're open 24 hrs, if you can't think of anywhere else to eat...At least the coconut paleta was good..."
3,"I call this a hidden gem.  After trekking across town to find it (if you blink you might miss it) I was surprised to find a cute, urban chic interior with fantastic food.\n\nYou walk in through purple velvet curtains into a white interior filled with abstract paintings in black and gold of the city of Montreal.  Kind of cool, gaudy, hipster all at the same time.  I've now been there 4 times and keep coming back.\n\nFavorites: breakfast poutine.  It's on the specials list or you can ask for it.... but it's amazing!  egg, sausage, cheese, gravy (I know I'm missing some ingredients)... etc.  surprisingly filling but amazing flavor!\n\nI love their french toasts with the yummy fruits and the options of toppings.\nThey even have a honey and plain yogurt dip on the side allowing you to get just enough sweet and still call it breakfast.\n\nTheir special french toast is made with cinnamon danish and topped with fresh fruit.  I stayed away the first few times thinking it would be way too sweet.  The waitress convinced me to try... and I'm glad I did.  The fruit lightened the flavor and it was just on the edge of dessert.  Yum!\n\nWishlist/Changes: My friend got Eggs in a nest - which was two pieces of their cheese bread with an egg right in the middle.  The potatoes were a bit bland that morning and the \""cheese\"" bread tasted like white bread.  A little disappointing but still tasted good.\n\nTheir service is always with a friendly smile... but pretty slow.  When you've been waiting 35 minutes-1 hour and you're one of 4 tables in the joint..... kind of a bummer.  But... the food has always been well worth it and I'll keep coming back.  I even brought a friend from Florida here and she was shocked at how amazing it was.  Thumbs up if you're ready for an adventure to find it and are interested in a fun experience and ambiance."
3,"We came on a Wednesday evening because a contact lens company wanted to wine and dine us. For drinks, I had an Italian margarita. Appetizers, we had fried calamari and a fried vegetable platter. My entree was 16oz NY steak and shrimp scampi and my gf had the 10oz steak and shrimp scampi. For dessert, we had cheese cake and tiramisu! Full course! what what! haha\n\n- Easy parking. South of the strip. Near South LV outlets\n- Elegant vibe. Pianist playing classics. At one point, there was a live singer. I was surprised they did all this on a Wednesday. \n-  Great service. Multiple servers. Nice recommendations. Quick refills. \n- Italian margarita gave me a light buzz. Nice amaretto flavor, sweet and sour.  \n- Funny that we order American and not Italian. It's an Italian restaurant. \n- Calamari was average. Salty\n- Vegetable platter was good. I enjoyed the mushroom and zuchhini \n- I ordered my steak medium and it came to me medium-well. Fail. Gf ordered Med-Well, and it came well done. 2x fail. I guess next time I'll order med-rare to get med! haha\n- Otherwise, steak was seasoned nice. Not the best steak, but no real complaints\n- Scampi was amazing! Flavor was strong. Loved it. Wish it came with a bit more. I'm not sure if I'd pay $12 for it myself though. \n- The potatoes were presented in slices stacked on top of each other, which I have never seen before. Delicious taste and wonderful texture. \n- Cheese cake was ordinary. Far from Cheese Cake Factory. More like buffet-style cheesecake. \n- I had a great time. Nice ambiance. Video poker if you're bored. Good recommendation for a fancy dine out."
2,Went there this morning for breakfast. Both the Lox and bagel were delicious but they were very chinsey on lox. Had to order a side of lox where we were given a slice and a quarter for $7. Silly no point!  Should give enough to cover two pieces of a bagel no one makes a sammy. \nThanks
0,This place has really went downhill. Really nothing open at all only whole foods and a couple other stores and 3 restaurants. I think if they did something to this place and add more stores like pacsun and NIKE and other teen and men stores then this place would be better
4,"My son has been going here for about 5 months. It's his first time in child care. He loves it here. The teachers are remarkable. He is learning sooo much! The school is extremely clean. The teachers are very organized and there are no behavior problems or issues with the children. Even when my son goes to kindergarten next year, I will definately make sure he gets to spend time with Ms. Chrystal and the rest of her staff."
4,"This space is fantastic, great prices and great service.  Willy is the only barber I will go to from now on.  Best fade and straight razor on the valley.  I am sure that everyone at the shop is fantastic but Willy has bar none given me the best cut I have had in a long time."
1,"Prix Fixe Event Review:\n\nWe chose P.J. Clarke's to host a family member's 100th birthday.  As there were \nroughly 50 people attending, we chose to do a prix fixe menu in the Sidecar room.  We chose a $45 per head menu that included soup, salad, entree, 4 family-style sides and dessert.\n\nFrom the beginning, there were glitches.  We called the restaurant several (4) times to set up an appointment to discuss the menu.  No returned calls despite direct promises to call us back.  At that point, we started to reconsider our choice.  However, we finally set something up and had our menu appointment.  The staff was very apologetic but, still, not a good start.\n\nThe day of the event, the restaurant was really welcoming and let us set up in the room prior to the event.  It was great having that flexibility, we didn't feel pressured to get in and out.\n\nUnfortunately, when the dinner started, so did the problems.  The main problem was that they understaffed the event.  There were 2-4 servers working the event, but most were just bringing out the food.  It was really hard to get refills, silverware, etc.\n\nDuring dinner, the tomato soup, which, per the contract, was to include grilled cheese toast, did not arrive at the tables with the toast.  We asked the waitress about it and she said, with a bit of attitude, \""no one told me that it was supposed to come with the soup.\"" It was clearly on the menus sitting at every table.  So, we had to then flag down the night manager who apologized and handed out toast to everyone (she was really nice and helpful). Sadly, most people had finished their soup at that point. \n\nThen, they brought out the salads.  Many of them didn't have salad dressing and, once again, waiters had to be flagged down. Next, they brought the entrees, but didn't provide steak knives for the skirt steak.  Basic necessities were hard to come by for this meal.\n\nThe family-style sides were really laughable though.  To my table of 10, they brought 20 tater tots to share, two tiny pots of mushrooms, and14 asparagus spears.  They, once again, forgot the french fries, and when those finally arrived, it consisted of roughly two-four handfuls for the table.  Really stingy, in my opinion.  I would have preferred larger portions of just two sides.\n\nThe dessert consisted of cheesecake and cobbler.  Two slices of each per 10 person table. Yeah......\n\nI really like the sidecar room and think it's a great spot to host an event.  My main concern with this event was the service or lack thereof.  It was really stressful to keep running around, hunting down staff, to fix basic issues like issuing silverware and providing salad dressing.  Also, some of the staff weren't very friendly at times and I saw one of them giving unwarranted attitude to one of the elderly guests.  The bartender, however, was awesome and really nice to everyone.\n\nOverall, the food was good but the service was lacking.  I would probably return, but only for a small dinner."
4,"Our son has attended this preschool and just graduated today. He loved it, and had made good friends with his classmates. He loves his teacher, Ms. Sarah, and always looked forward to taking something to show-and-tell. His overall experience, I think, had been a pleasant one for him.\n\nI like how there are only few students per class so Ms. Sarah was able to pay good attention to what her students needed to learn and at what pace. Our son learned a lot of things he needed to learn before Kindergarten (colors, numbers, letters, days of the week, reading, etc) so we are really satisfied that we sent him to this school.\n\nMs. Tanya takes over the admin side of things, and she's been really friendly and helpful. I liked how when she reminded us of public school registration date because I wasn't aware of it. \n\nThey also had a field trip and our son had fun with it. We celebrated holidays throughout the school year with food contributions which I liked because it made our son aware of what they were going to celebrate in school.\n\nGraduation today was a blast! For a little school, it was really really well prepared and decorated. The children performed magnificently. It was short and sweet, too, so the kids didn't get cranky. \n\nI recommend this school to anyone looking for a preschool."
4,"So glad that I can update my review to now be 5 star. Foonzo went through a couple of changes as they were testing out to see what worked and what didn't, now that it works, oh damn does it work!!! They now have more beer choices, a fully stocked bar, and a full kitchen. Prices have leveled out and having a super competent and adorable waitress was also a great change! I uploaded the food / drink menus in the photos, I tend to judge restaurants on the \""different\"" dishes, such as veggie burgers. I can confirm that their veggie burger is DELICIOUS. They have the perfect marinade, and dipping in their BBQ sauce made me glad I ordered the veggie over the pattie and bacon (this coming from a carnivore). Their beer buckets are perfect for keeping your table in order and their \""drop shots\"" are an inexpensive little party round (try the Chupacabra - tequila & Monster). They also have a nerdy-named martini menu which is a nice touch. So excited to come here regularly and master my gaming skills."
0,"Had to file a complaint with corporate office. Enough is enough with the horrible customer service.  I have four dogs therefore I probably go once a week to get food for them.  Every single time I stop in there is no greeting, no \""how can I help you\""....and when you do ask for help it seems like it bothers them.  If you don't like working for Petco please do not take it out on the customers. I really hope corporate talks to them and brings it to their attention because I will not be coming back.  I am going to go out of my way to find a local family owned pet store that actually still values the relationship with their customers."
3,"I have been here twice recently and I think this is my new go-to place. There are other sports bar/happy hour places close by, but they are definitely in a league to themselves, and not in a good way. Unlike the d-bag & biker crowd just a block away, Fox and Hound Pub has a friendly crowd with a great staff. I reviewed the new sports bar down the road and remarked how slow the service was there - Fox and the Hound has an attentive staff that has never left me waiting. \n\nI have had the Ranch hand burger and it was excellent. The nachos were something else I have tried - amazing! They have a large selection of beer on tap and craft beers (both domestic and import) that will please any beer drinker. \n\nThe last two times I have visited I have sat at the bar and had Stefani. She is very friendly, attentive, and good to talk to. I have not been disappointed with the service or the selection here. A definite happy hour must stop."
3,"Athenian Express has a HUGE selection of things to chose from. They have salads, burgers, gyros, pasta, subs, and pitas! There are also LOTS of vegetarian items.\nTheir hummus is out of this world. They make it fresh every morning and it comes with a generous helping of their pita that they get flown in from chicago because it's some of the best pita in the country.\nI've had lots of different things on their menu and I liked each and every thing I've tried. Sometimes their fries are a little over cooked and under salted but whatever, I don't go there for the fries.\nThe gyros are great, so are their pitas. My favorite pita is the chicken picado. The chicken is always very juicy and fresh and the grilled vegetables are well cooked and pair well with the chicken.\nI know they're also doing breakfast now, which I have had once. I don't remember what I got because it was some years ago, but I remember leaving satisfied and full.\n\nI think for the price and quality, you just can't beat Athenian express. For a year, I worked right next door to them. I would stop in almost every day and get lunch and talk with the owner and his wife. They are very friendly and funny, as is their staff. I always felt welcomed. Even with phones ringing off the hook and lines out the door, they always have a smile on their faces.\nI stop in maybe once every 3 months or so and the only thing that's changed since I worked next to them is that they've renovated and made the place bigger. Some people might not like that, but they generate way too much business and they really needed the extra seating area.\n\nI love Athenian Express, and their employees. It's a hidden gem that I'm glad I found."
4,"I vacillated between four and five stars for this place due to the fact that when I hold it up to all of the restaurant experiences and food I have had, it fits more into a four star but when I compare it to other Vegas dining experiences, it is a clear five so five it is!\n\nBasically, it is just a really nice place with a great menu, superb service, and delicious food.  We started with oysters on the half shell which were excellently shucked and wonderfully fresh. Moved to two salads, one with blue cheese and walnuts, the other with warm goat cheese over dressed greens which were both executed well and were complimented with fresh chewy delicious bread. \n\nFor entrees, my husband had the lamb and I had the chicken. We also opted for sides of mushrooms and mac and cheese. Everything was excellent however the mushrooms were over salted. Considering this wasn't a theme in the meal, I won't hold it against them. \n\nAll of this was accompanied with a nice and inexpensive bottle of white wine which was served and presented as if it was a $300 bottle. That kind of service is always an indicator of a well run restaurant and an attentive staff. Overall cost of the meal was expensive but very, very fairly priced for when we got. \n\nAfter visiting a wide array of places in Vegas, I would recommend this place as a must!"
1,"I am Mexican and didn't like the food but the guacamole and the elote were good I think that was the only thing that I liked, the service was really good though."
3,We stopped for a late night dinner at the Great Dane Brew Pub on our way to Chicago. It had a nice atmosphere; I could definitely see us spending a lot of time here if we lived in the area. I am not a beer drinker but I did love their root beer. My husband *loves* beer and really enjoyed all of the ones that he tried.  My pot pie was delicious and my husband's burger was really good. If we ever find ourselves in the area again we would go back for sure.
3,"After 24 hours on the Strip, you need to get away. A 15-minute drive out to an anonymous, deserted strip mall on W. Sahara you'll find Rosemary's, whose food can compete bite-for-bite w/ the Michelin 1- and 2-star restaurants at the resorts. We deferred to the prix fixe menus and were not disappointed!"
3,"Came to town for some training and wanted to try this place out. Not just because it was on Triple D but it got great reviews on Yelp too. I had The Five Spot with a side of homefries. The food was excellent, has to be the best breakfast sammich ever. The homefries are really good too, but the sammich was the best. Definitely worth checking out. I went on a Monday around 1 pm and the place was pretty full, but no wait. Its good enough to wait for though."
2,A great place for Sunday afternoon to chill with your family and friends. Relax and chill environment with a pond with giants gold fishes with head waterfall. You can hear the tam tam drums from a distance.  a great place to unwind. The sever Katherine was very sweet and suggest a gazpacho and with a killer tomatoes and jalape\u00f1o jam. Yummy.\nOverall; its a decent place to bring your friends and eat light food but a bit overpriced .
3,"when the mother wants lobster, to red lobster we go. it was a bit different when i went to college in maine and she came for a visit but hellsya red lobster brought the goods tonight, specifically tim, our waiter, and as the hostess referred to him as she sat us (i think all red lobster wait staff may somehow go by the same title but tim was ridic), our \""seafood expert\"".  \n\nfirst, tim fielded the 129 questions about substitutions from my mom like he wrote the book on jewish mothers. it was like he knew that when my mom tries a bite of someone else's food she returns the spoon or fork with half of the original food on it.  when we asked for an additional spoon for her to try my soup, he brought her a little plastic cuppy of soup just for her, to avoid half eaten food on utensil interference.  \n\nsecond, my wine pour was generous and appreciated. third, i don't know what the fuck is in those buttery delicious biscuits but hot damn they were buttery delicious (for anyone who comes to portland or lives in portland and reads this, imagine pine state biscuits times 2347) and fo freee and tim kept em coming. \n\nchains often get a bad rap, and often for good reasons. but tim the seafood expert + decentish lobster+ buttery delicious biscuits + big wine = 4 star.\nmy only negative is that they are really pushing this design your own festival of shrimp shit a bit too much.\ni have now unbuttoned and am ready for the rest of a night with mother, which will likely involve law and order, cribbage, and our daily routine of shitting on sheriff joe.\ntoy lista"
0,"Really?! Adding potatoes to canned corned beef hash does not make it 'homemade\"" as menu states. Very deceitful. And also, poached eggs are NOT the same as basted."
0,"Not recommended at all.\nWorst place to go for Eye Exam.\nIt took us about same time as going to Emergency room in the hospital.\nNo point of taking appointment,they make you wait for hours."
3,"I first want to start out by saying I love First Watch. I was always reluctant to try it but after the first time I met my soon to be mom in law there for lunch I was hooked. Before I seriously started watching my weight I would usually get the ham and cheese to the fifth degree and the tomato soup combo. *HOLY CHEESY FOODGASM IN MY MOUTH* it is to die for. Although it isn't printed on the menu anymore you can still ask for it and they will make it. Now when we go I order the Power Wrap (which is on the lighter side menu) I never knew egg whites, spinach, turkey, and Swiss cheese topped with salsa could be so damn good. Their mango iced tea is awesome as well. As for the establishment it's self it is always clean. The staff is typically pretty friendly and accommodating. I almost want to give them 5 stars but I do believe some improvements could be made to better some of their menu items. So I'll give it 4 stars... Yay! I'm a fan."
4,"We have dined at Buca before, but it had been a long time ago and boy did we forget how great the food is here! We started off with the di Beppo salad, so fresh and the Italian dressing was so flavorful.  We shared the supreme pizza and WOW, large topping, super fresh ingredients so full of flavor. For dinner we shared the carbonara. Our server Jake suggested saut\u00e9ed shrimp with the dish and it was just perfect. We finished the meal with the chocolate cake. The food was superb and the personal service from Jake just made the evening perfect. We can't wait to go back!! Thanks Buca!"
3,"Very good pub food. Had the Pub Spots, Deviled Eggs and Crisps I recommend this place."
3,"I am always a fan of a good patisserie, and this is a good patisserie.  It was a little busy/hectic around 2pm on a weekday, but I grabbed a croissant and eyed the brioche and madeleines and tarts.  Unfortunately, their butter croissant has a sweet glaze to it.  It's not overpowering, but it's definitely not the way I want my butter croissant.  Also, this is not the heavenly croissants one can find in Europe...it has an excellent texture and I'm pretty sure they're all-butter, but the flavor isn't complex/deep at all."
4,"I called Matthew after reading reviews posted here and the praise was well-deserved.  My husband and I have some health issues now and could not keep up with our yard.  Matthew did a fantastic job getting it back in order.  The price he quoted for the amount of work needed was fair and reasonable (notice I didn't say cheap).  The amount of work needed to be done was extensive and labor intensive and he did all of the pruning work himself - no chainsaws or indiscriminate hacking away at my trees and shrubs that other \""landscapers\"" have done.  In this case, I believe you get what you pay for - Matthew is an arborist so he has the necessary training/skills to do what is best for plants."
3,"5 Stars\nService:  Everyone was very friendly and answered all questions regarding the menu and details about the restaurant.  This is casual dining, so you order and sit down; however the staff came by our table many times to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.  \nGrilled Pizzas: Holy crap, the grilled pizza was unreal.  We got the house made pesto pizza with bell peppers and onions.  The flavor was fresh, the dough was much lighter than any other pizza I've had and the portion was large enough for two people to get their fill.  \n\n4 Stars:\nAmbience:  I really like the set up, very reminiscent of Brixx's but still unique.  They have a bar in the middle, booths on one side, and a long wooden table in the front for big groups.  The second time my girlfriend and I went, they were projecting a video about Italy on a side wall (this seemed odd and the sound was off so it didn't serve much of a purpose).  \nMozzarella Wedges: I love it when restaurants serve wedges instead of sticks because they usually have more cheese in them.  They could certainly use a little more salt but they were very appetizing.\n\n3 Stars: \nTrue Traditional Pizza:  Maybe this speaks to how good our experience has been but this was the only thing about the restaurant that made me go \""ehh.\""  The pizza was good but it was very bready and the toppings were very light for $1 a topping.  The difference between this pizza and the grilled pizza was enormous.  I also felt like it was less food for more money.  \n\nOverall, I love this place.  I still want to try the oven baked pizzas and the home made gelato but I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh new pizza experience in South Charlotte.  It looks like they have a good local beer selection to so I am eager to try that one weekend.\n\nBottom Line: Get the grilled pizza!"
4,"This bar is in the Blair house suites hotel which was just remodeled, and they added this place just about 6-9 months ago. I must say that I did not expect much from this place, but the bartenders, food, and the video poker where all awesome, and all the flat screens weren't bad. Drinks were strong, food absolutely amazing!"
4,"I went here again for the second time. OMG!!!!!! the Salmon was delicious. It was the best salmon i had forever. The outside was crispy and the inside was just right. Of course, we also got the duck too. That was the best dish in the restaurant. It's really worth it for a nice dinner for two. Very pricey but well worth it."
4,"I was recently in some training in Pittsburgh, and we came here towards the end of our class.\n\nThey had a sign on the curb outside that said they had \""the best prime rib\"".  Now, I don't think I can say that they had \""the best\"", but it was very good, and a pretty big serving too.\n\nOur waiter (John) was exceptional, excellent service, fun personality, very knowledgable."
0,"I'm tempted to write a long review about how bad this company is, but I think I've already wasted enough time with them. AVOID\n\nSome highlights of my experience with \""Lydia\"":\n1. Realtor waited until the day I arrived in Vegas to tell me she refuses to show me the property I'm interested in unless I come to the office first to look at other properties. \n2. Realtor gave me the incorrect address for the office\n3. Realtor chastised me for being \""fixated\"" on one property\n4. Tried to talk to someone regarding investing in short term property rentals, no one in this office has heard of AirBNB, lol\n\nUnprofessional garbage. Nothing gets me more irritated than Agents who still think they are blowing your fucking mind by showing you properties on their computer, the same properties you have already seen on your computer days ago, because we live in the information age. Someone needs to put these old goats out to pasture. \n\nI already wasted my time, you shouldn't have to waste yours."
0,Figured I couldn't go wrong with Chili's.  WRONG!  Very limited menu.  Hamburger was nasty!  Will avoid Chili's Too locations in the future.
4,"did not stay here, but did explore inside and even did the gondola ride."
2,"A lot has changed at this place.   All new faces and a whole different food.  But honestly the taste of the food has fallen below my expectation.   \n\nThey had the best Hakka Noodles, Indian style chilli chicken, Gobi Manchurian and Goan shrimp.   But not anymore.   Even their special biriyani looks and tastes different.   \n\nI would give them one more chance before taking them off my favorite restaurants list."
2,"I decided to stop in before going to see Sarah Brightman at Jobing Dot Com Arena. I was off to a late start but wanted to enjoy a good meal before the show to make a night of it. \n\nI enjoyed the ambiance of the place right off. The usual dark wood and dark booths but I liked the decor. It just looked 'comfortable' to me for lack of a better word. \n\nThe place was busy....most of it seemed pre-concert rush. I was told my server would be right there and then in a minute or so the manager came over to get a drink order. My server was at an adjacent table and seemed to be dealing with a 'problem' table. From what I could hear it seemed to be one of those \""I want this....BUT with this and not with that...and with this on the side....\"" type of tables. So he was busy. \n\nThey had a special menu that was featuring a pork tenderloin with a maple glaze that sounded really good. I did ask the server if it was a quick dish to come out and was told they were all ready out of it for the evening. Which was fine....hey, you snooze, you lose. So I ordered the goat cheese ravioli. \n\nIt came out pretty quick and I was actually quite impressed with the dish. It was served with some sauteed spinach and had a handful of pine nuts tossed in. Pasta, goat cheese, spinach, pine nuts....right up my alley. Don't think they could go wrong with that for me if they tried. \n\nOn the special menu they were offering a pumpkin cheesecake which sounded awfully good to me. I checked the time and I was doing pretty good so I was debating if I should get a slice. \n\nWell, all of a sudden my server dropped off my check. \""Whenever you're ready\"". Okay....no dessert I guess. He picked up my empty plate and was gone. \n\nI wasn't quite sure if he knew I was headed to the show like the rest of the patrons or he just wanted me gone and out of there. I did ask him about the quickness of the pork tenderloin so I'm not sure if he just assumed I was in a hurry and was trying to help me out or what. As a whole I really hate getting my check without being offered anything else or while I'm still eating...but I'll give the server the benefit of the doubt with this one. \n\nOn the way out I did ask when they closed because I was thinking of coming back for the pumpkin cheesecake after the show but they closed at 10 so that wouldn't work. \n\nSo, next time I'm in the area I'd like to check it out again when I have some more time. Some of the menu items sounded pretty good and like I said earlier I did enjoy the atmosphere so I would like to relax and enjoy a meal there at a not so hectic time. \n\nA solid three stars.....and hopefully will bump it up with a review update when I get to visit a second time."
1,"I'm really sad I have to come back and udate my review.  We visited Island again last Friday and had a pretty bad experience.  The service was AWFUL.  We went as a group of 6.... all ordered AYCE.  We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second.  That's really unacceptable.\n\nAs far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi.  On a Friday night at 6:30?  That's crazy.  And that would probably explain what the hold up was.\n\nOur waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.  When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less.  \""Yeah, we know we're having problems.  You have 90 minutes, don't worry.\""  Lame.\n\nThere were still some very yummy rolls, but worth waiting an hour and a half for?  Not at all.  \n\nIt was very disappointing."
1,There was nothing special whatsoever about this pizza. As a matter of fact it lacked flavor it was bland. Even the dessert trio was just ok nothing special. It was like something I could buy at the grocery store. Even the service was sub par.
1,"GREAT food.  awesome bar w/huge fish tank & gimmicks.  i like the \nbuilt-in pro bass shop.  fun/cool casino & staff.  extremely nice/comfortable rooms.  the bad thing: it's several miles from vegas & no free shuttle anymore. also, i used to get comped rooms & the new person in charge of offering them wants about $30/nite sun-thurs.  a 30 spot & isolated from the strip w/no shuttle?--Meh."
3,"Straight up looks like Matrix Reloaded in here!\n\nSeriously, if you're looking for a \""Vegas Nightclub\"" experience, then this is your place. It's intimate, the dance floor is packed and the drinks are overpriced. Everything you need to gawk at girls and go back to your hotel room with your bros saying things like, \""She was ugly anyway.\"""
1,"Ich finde die Atmosph\u00e4re ganz gut, es ist viel Platz und das Personal war nett. \n\nDas Essen war sehr sehr sehr fettig. In dem Moment war es ganz ok, aber im Nachgang widersteht es mir total."
0,I was on vacation at a cabin in WI with my boyfriend. We stopped in Madison for the day and stopped in at Espresso Royale to warm up and use the internet. I had what was hands down the worst hot chocolate I have ever had. It didn't even taste like chocolate. It was really light too. Maybe they forgot the chocolate? It tasted like nothing. Absolutely horrible. My boyfriend's latte was mediocre at best. I generally prefer to avoid the national coffee chains but in this case I really wish I had gone to Starbucks.
4,"The weather was finally nice enough to eat outside on the patio.  The music was so loud that I had to ask our server to turn the music down.   We had another $40 Groupon for the 3 of us.\n\nWe ordered 3 rolls of sushi and a salad.\n\nVampire Roll ($11.95): Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Crab, Seared Albacore, Jalapenos with Garlic Ponzu sauce on the side.  I liked this roll and would order it again.\n\nSpider Roll ($10.95):  This is my favorite roll and we have ordered it every time.\n\nSalmon Skin Roll ($6.45):  I liked this roll so much that we ordered it again.  This time it was drowning in eel sauce.  Next time I would ask for the sauce on the side.\n\nAhi Poke Salad:  This was my favorite salad and we have ordered it a couple of times.\n\nWe will be back."
0,"My daughter was here 3 days. Each day when I came to pick her up after being gone 10 hours her coat was still on! Nobody paid enough attention to remove it after 10 hours!!!\n\nThe 3rd day I picked her up. I looked through the peep window. The Hispanic  \""teacher\"" was holding one Hispanic child on her hip. My daughter  (black)\nwas standing right beside the teacher crying her head off, face red snot running, scared. I could tell she had been crying for a while cuz her skin was blotchy. My daughter was looking up at the teacher hands out stretched to get her attention the teacher was looking at the wall completely ignoring my daughter. I flipped my shit!!! I asked how long she had been crying the woman shrugged and said oh about 10 minutes. 10 minutes!!! I said lady you couldn't run in place for 10 minutes but you got my daughter here crying for 10 minutes ignoring her!!! Even 3 minutes is a long time when a kid is crying upset like that. The kid on her hip was not crying or in distress at all. So why not put that kid down and try to calm my daughter down??? The stupid bitch. I reported this location to the people that investigate this stuff but I never got a follow up about what they did. \nThe cameras don't record at all! So they are useless. And if something like this were to happen to your kid there would be no proof of it. \nI certainly do not recommend this location for any children!"
3,"I just had a delicious meal at subba- the Nepali chicken was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. My less adventuresome dining partner had general Tsos chicken and he swears it's the best he's ever had. The service was on the slower side, but very gracious and welcoming. You could tell it's a small operation and just the kind of tasty find you really want to see succeed. We even got a free special Diwali treat at the end of our meal. Were already looking forward to returning to try some more dishes!"
1,"I'm sorry.. But I just don't get this place. \n\nI didn't like the menu... I didn't like the food.... I didn't like the service... Didn't like the fact that I waited over an hour to be seated..... Didn't like the price... Their drinks are small and... well, just bad.... Didn't like the club/ restaurant thing going... Even their air con pissed me off... lol...... \n\nYes, the decor here is amazing and inspiring blah blah..... \n\n*urgh*"
0,What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concerned
0,"This place was awful. Went for a friends birthday party everything was fine for the first few hours until they closed. My friend ( the birthday girl) and I were quickly using the ladies room while our boyfriends were settling a tab of over 600 dollars when one of the managers burst in the bathroom and refused to leave! We were on our way out just washing our hands when we asked him to excuse us we would just be a moment he refused. I understand they need to get people out but refusing to leave the ladies bathroom is just creepy. The only reason we were still there was because they weren't finished w our tab. He proceeded to speak to us very rudely saying we had no manners and kicked us out the back door saying \""we didnt deserve to go out the front\"" really after having a table and bottle service all night. It was ridiculous when outside I told them they were being so rude and they physically shoved us off the property saying \""get off our property\"" to push around two little girls like this completely un provoked is just ridiculous. It seemed to me that manager or whoever  was totally abusing his power around there. I have never been treated this rudely anywhere but the fact that we spent that much money and they literally threw the birthday girl out the minute they closed is just really tacky and unprofessional. They shouldn't be treating anyone like this and expect to be open too long. I for one will never be back and will tell everyone I know never to go there. It was ok prior to their rudeness at the end but knowing that they would ever threat people this way I would never go back. So I guess go if you want to spend a lot of money then be treated poorly."
4,"I love the hot tri colored chips, taco Tuesday! Karaoke Thursday, Happy Hour from 3-6 and brunch on Sunday! Killer homeade margarita and my new favorite bartender, Vincanto, \""Vinny\"" made up the best Dulce de Leche martini. We loved the mahi mahi tacos, the carnitas and the guacamole! The place is so comfy, swanky, and very welcoming. I'm so happy that it's right across the street from home. Sorry Lindo!!!! Chinita's wins!!!"
0,Waited 20 min before the girl told Us its a 30 min wait..... Didn't know that it take 30 min to make one smoothie.... Would not recommend any one to go before she didn't even seem like she wanted to take our order
0,"I have been three times since moving to AZ, and the last two were ot by choice.  I have yet to leave without an awful headache from the ridiculously loud music.  It is cramped and the food is no better than what you'd order in a drive thru.  The prices are outrageous and the staff is less than 'happy'.  I don't know what AZ88 the other posters have been to yielding these great reviews, but if an awful headache and overpriced drive thru food served from unhappy cramped environments interests you, then this is your place.  I will never go again, even if forced.  Turn down the music and I may consider it...avoid!"
1,"The illy coffee when made correctly is to die for! But the croissants at $5.00 a piece, W O W!!!! The quality of the coffee beverage that you order can differ from day to day based on who makes it, so I have to reduce my rating of them by a few b/c of the cups of coffee with little to no flavor in them that I received. \nLiked: Service, Atmosphere, Decor Disliked: Food, Value"
0,"This place was crazy. We thought at first that the staff must be a bunch of college students that just started working a week ago, but after reading the other reviews, I'm not sure this is true! I think one major issue is that there is team service and thus no one individual waiter was responsible for our table. \n\nThere was one waiter (blond, short) who seemed to be in charge. He spent most of our visit appearing baffled. I watched him at the register station trying to write up bills and use the register. Comical. It took 15 minutes for them to visit our table after we were seated. After that the food came out at a nice pace - first some appetizer type things, then the steamed dumpling appetizer we ordered, and our entrees. \n\nThe food was fine. I am not a Korean food connoisseur, so I can't really comment on how authentic or good it is - to our American palates, it was just ok. Also seemingly expensive, but the portions were large. \n\nOnce we were done eating, we started waiting. We waited, and waited and waited. The servers ignored us, and noodled around - they never actually look at the diners so it was super difficult to get anyone's attention. Finally we called a skinny waiter over, and asked for two simple things: 1) the check (which seemed to please him) and 2) take out boxes (which caused him to furrow his brow and look slightly angry). OK. \n\nSo this guy then continues doing random crap as if we had never asked for anything. 5-10 minutes go by while he walks back and forth to the kitchen, empty handed, and refilling water glasses (I must say, they were excellent with water service). It was as if we had never spoken to him. Finally we call the short blond waiter over and ask for 1) the check and 2) boxes. He says, oh, of course. He asks the skinny guy to get us boxes. Skinny guy rolls his eyes and says \""yeah, yeah, yeah\"". Skinny guy proceeds to do other things for another 10 minutes before finally procuring two take out containers from the depths of Squirrel Hill. \n\nNow for the check. We waited and waited some more. Blond, short waiter looks confused but decides he needs something to do. He walks around asking how everyone's food is. He takes orders from other tables. Finally, we ask, can we *please* for the love of everything that is holy have our check? He replied incredulously, \""Oh! You haven't gotten your check yet?!?!?!?\"" So if he didn't get our check, who would have gotten it? He is the check guy! OMG I didn't even know what to think. \n\nNeedless to say, we paid in cash to save the pain of waiting our credit card to be run. And then we ran out of the restaurant. Please go to the Green Pepper only if 1) You truly love Korean food or 2) You are writing an expose on baffled waiters. Hahaha, I'm glad I went just for the memory."
4,Great supermarket...has most foods that you need from around the world at really good prices
1,"This is a neat, unique restaurant, but not one item was worth the price. This restaurant is not fine dining, so to pay six bucks for four onion rings seemed off to me."
1,"I always enjoy trying new styles of bbq, this is Chicago style bbq! Being from Texas you get used just one style TEXAS! The location is in a strip mall a decent but not very desirable area. When I first walked in the place had interesting decor from the bathroom doors being a Pepsi machine! The wait was a little long to order at the counter but I'm a patient man. I ordered up the brisket sand which basket came w one side and a pickle for about $10. Little over priced but it did come w a drink. The brisket was served w a little fat which I like and the sauce was good. The  potato salad tasted pre made from a tub. I'd recommend trying the place once but not sure I'll be back as there are certainly better bbq in phx."
3,"I can vouch for the cheese curds, so wonderful when they are fresh, otherwise, much like other places' cheese curds, they become sluggy traps of oil and blah.\n\nI trudged through my Old Fashioned even though I am a beer dude. It was strong and packed a helluva punch, but totally worth it. I first thought it was a Wisconsinan sangria.\n\nEnjoyable."
1,"Was it worth the 2-hour wait? The first time I came here a few years ago, I would definitely say yes.  But this time I would say, Eh, not really.  They kept running out of food.  The lines were too long outside and as well as inside the buffet that by the time you got to the food you want, they had already run out.  I went back to check and they had replaced it with an entirely different dish!  A few years ago, the food was way better and what I remember most was the crepe section.  Blueberry and whip crepe.....mmmmm, but this time it tasted yucky..what happened?? I could've sworn I saw someone eating chocolate dipped strawberries, but I never saw it at the dessert station, so I opted for the creme brulee, which I must say, is not bad.  And they ran out of Italian dressing for salad.  What the???"
0,"not authentic, period.  Waaaaay over priced for its ingredients and portion. Never trust those local quebec newspapers because they don't know much about asian food anyway and they haven't traveled or experienced much outside of quebec. Another word, they don't know what they are talking about. \n\nOrdered the spicy octopus with cucumber. It came out like Chinese Szechuan side dish with lots of sesame oil in it. Cucumber was not even marinated. Any Chinese person could've made a much better version than that. $6 for tiny 5 pieces of octopus and 1/4 of a cucumber? Kidding me. \n\nGyoza was recommended by the waiter. Seriously?!  If you buy frozen leek dumplings from Korean supermarket for your restaurant, at least don't advertise it as \""recommendation item\"". Japanese don't eat leek. Koreans do. $6 for 5 frozen dumplings for what I can buy the entire bag of them. You don't make dumplings from scratch it's no big deal, but just don't pretend people will not recognize it. \n\nFinally, the ramen. I had the lobster miso broth. Lobster seafood flavoured MSG was heavily added coz I felt EXTREMELY thirsty afterward. Ramen was just average, not memorable.  Lack of ingredients of traditional ramen. Other local Isakayas had better ramen, not to mention those NYC places or in Japan. \n\nFYI, my check was $73 for two ramens, that fantastic cucumber and gyoza and a 350ml drink. Could've had two courses much more promising French instead. \n\nWhat a replica!\n\nP.S.When diners review a restaurant, isn't food the most important? Yes you like the decor and the service, but you don't just pay to sit there and admiring the space unless you're in a museum."
1,"YUCK...skip!\nEasily the WORST BURGERS I've ever eaten. The burgers lacked flavor even with the toppings. We ordered: Applerum burger and Tinshack smokehouse burger. Both left a lot to be desired. The fries were not fries at all, more like potato chips (some thin and crispy & others thick). The sweet potato fries/chips were good but not  enough to return for. \nPOOR SERVICE. TEPID FOOD. The service left a lot to be desired also. She (the waitress) was behaving as though she was doing us a favor, oppose to her job. \n\nThe FLIES that kept landing on my plate was the last straw...I couldn't finish my food"
3,"They serve melted cheese on buttery bread and play roots reggae in the diner. I'm sold.\n\nThe place is small and casual but well designed with a cute vibe. The menu changes all the time but obviously consists mostly of variations on grilled cheese. Some funky ones I've tried include: burrito grilled cheese, pesto grilled cheese, and drumroll...poutine grilled cheese. \n\nSo if you're looking for a quick, casual meal or a naughty snack this side of Decarie, Le Cheese is the place to be."
4,"They do a great job! Ive been going here for many years, and they are prompt and they have good customer service.\n\nIf you go you should get the stylist Tommy, he is the owner and he styles hair as well. I recommend him for two main reasons, one he is very good at giving you the look you want, but he is also very funny. He talks to you and he has this chinese accent and its hilarious to listen to. \n\nbut overall this place is awesome! incase anyone doesnt know they used to be Hong Kong Hair in the Cathay House plaza on Spring Mtn. and Decatur... same people"
1,"Irksome gimmicky pub atmosphere, like a classier Bennigan's."
2,"Great pizza, weird menu set up. I would have though that a pizzeria would have their own little creative pizzas, but they dont. They give you a 8 1/2 by 22 inch menu that has plain pizza sizes and prices then toppings below that are $2 each , salads , sodas, desserts. We ordered a small pepporoni with ricotta cheese, DEEELICIOUS!!!\n\nOur waitress, very blah. I'm in the bar industry and i dont know if she was having a bad day or just hated her job but she def. wasn't attentative as she should have been. I had a cranberry juice and a water and both were empty most the time, she never refilled my drinks, I had to ask the busser to do it and it happily did it. Also, I noticed she delieved pizzas to her other tables and put a piece of pizza on each persons plates at the tables but ours....no big deal but again, strange. She also never made eye contact when talking to us, which I found odd.. I'll probably go to the straight to the bar next time, or get pizza to go.\n\n\nA Plus, Tuesdays are 1/2 off wines! I went on a Tuesday but unfortunantly for me I was taking the day off from drinking lol."
2,"I always get the yellow curry at a Thai restaurant. This was no exception. Look, I like fast/cheap food as much as the next guy, but I like more depth of flavor in what I eat. The veggies don't really contribute anything to the dish. They just seem to be a space/stomach-filler. They needed to be steamed longer. Potatoes were still hard and starchy.\n\nCheck out Wild Thaiger. A little more expensive but definitely worth it."
4,"This place is awesome.  We live a half mile away and never knew it was there it is so tucked away.  Beautiful farm with tons of shade trees.  They have fresh produce for cheap, fresh breads, jams, honey etc.  Homemade butter is soooo good.  We bought some produce then walked around the garden.  Highly recommended."
2,"I hate to do this but I have to bring Aloha Nails down a star. Mainly because of the service I had today. \n\nFor the most part, most of the ladies are very nice and are meticulous in their work. Today, I wasn't so lucky. I usually only get a pedicure but decided to have both a manicure and pedicure. \n\nThe nail tech doing my pedicure was nice and was careful in her work. It wasn't the same for the tech doing my manicure. \n\nWhen I sat down, she started small talk and wanted to know if I wanted my eye brows done. I said no and she said that she does brows. I said no thank you again. My manicure and pedicure were being done at the same time but I could only focus on my hands. She wasn't gentle (I have a cut on my cuticle and she kept sanding my nail beds to the point it irritated the cuticle and skin around my nail bed) and her work was sloppy. \n\nShe asked me to pay before I got nails polished, so I handed her my credit card and $20 for her to break. I'm usually very accommodating when nail places ask for tips in cash. She brought back a $10 and two $5's - I asked for one of the $5 to be broken down again.\n\nShe must have not liked that - perhaps she was expecting the $5 tip since that's what she gave me. I gave her a little more than 20% - I probably shouldn't have. When she polished my nails, it was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I chose a darker color so even the smallest smudge is easily seen. I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't. It's disappointing because I've had good service here before, a few times.\n\nI would go back to Aloha Nails because it's so convenient - maybe just for a pedicure - but I'd avoid this nail tech in the future."
0,"Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money."
0,"Don't understand how anyone could give this place anything more then one star for the simple fact of attitude. The food is ok, that's worth the one star. But the people in this place are so RUDE. They need to take some anger management lessons. No matter what you go in there for you get an attitude. My suggestion is go in don't look at anybody that works there don't ask any questions or think your able to buy anything on display. They get very upset and nasty with you if you buy something from the case that they have to replace."
3,"I was disappointed that they were not doing take out anymore, however, we came in today and i was extremely impressed with their food AND customer service. They really made the ordering process super easy."
0,This place was disgusting to say the least. Everything had a very off taste to it like it was spoiled/stale. The rice looked a day or 2 old. We took one bite of the food and our server crushed a roach right next to our booth. Yep that was it we paid and left and went and got a burger else where. This only got a 1 star rating because I can't rate it a 0!
4,"I used to take my Civic to Honda for everything that needed to be done. I am so glad that Mori is my go to guy since then, my family also brings their cars to have him fix them. He is honest and his work is perfect. His prices are much more realistic than the dealership. You will save more money by going to Mori at this shop. You will have it fixed in a timely manner too. Even for major work. Thumbs up to this shop and to Mori."
3,"Great to see they have a brick and mortar location now since I last saw them under their different name (Frost Bites) and set up (a food truck at Boulder Highway)! \n\nHad green tea the first go around and settled on black sesame the second time. Both flavors were great! For ice that looks intricate and textured, it's incredibly soft to taste. It's not overtly sweet or syrupy. When I ordered black sesame, I had it with boba and gummies! The boba was good but the gummies were not soft and chewy. Even though I didn't enjoy them, they did make for an interesting photo. \n\nParking is limited so if you find it appreciate it."
1,"I have two big qualms with this place:\n1) You do not get fries unless if you eat-in. Now really, how hard/expensive is it to include fries w/to-go orders?\n2) The Oakland location CHARGES for re-fills.. Considering they have probably marked up the softdrinks by 1000+% to begin with, I find this ridiculous.\n\nThe actual subs are decent, but I don't find them to be as good as everyone says they are. Overrated + my admittedly somewhat petty complaints above = I do not jump at the chance to go there."
2,"The food at the Spice Buffet was adequate, but not anything to write home about. The crab legs were steamed but not warm. The middle eastern fare was just ok. They had salad stations for each region. The rib steak was really quite rare. The  italian buffet fell short big time. Pasta was of low quality.  If I could, I would give this buffet  2 and one half stars. Def not a smorgasbord. Food was average. It was in my estimation a little better than the Bellagio which I feel is extremely overrated!"
3,"I had the steak tacos.  They were flavorful.  I haven't tried enough of the menu to properly give more insight.  I mainly wanted to review it because of the rude valet out front.  I couldn't find self parking around so I opted for their valet.  Normally, I would walk rather than pay someone to move my car.  On the valet sign there was no price for the service.  I assumed that it was complimentary and would give a tip.  Well, I got my car, gave what I thought was a decent tip, and was told there is a flat rate.  Luckily, I had just the right amount of cash for the rate, but no extra for the tip.   I could have pulled up, put on my flashers, and made change for them.  I decided not to do this after his reaction to me being unaware there was a flat rate (even though it wasn't on the sign...) He gave attitude to his coworker about me, right in front of me!  \n\nIt was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of the good food I just consumed.\n\nI gave 4 stars because Patron's food, decor, and service deserved it.  The valets would get 1 star, simply because they returned my car unharmed."
0,"This location is definitely SUBPAR!  I much prefer the Graham Street location -  the food at Graham is better tasting and more consistent. Also, the Graham St. staff is friendly. \n\nMy last two visits to the Milton Rd location have been a disappointment.  People smoking at the entrance. Slow service. Sub par food -- ordered beef ribs, they were bone rich and meat poor (in short, skimpy). The yams were hard and dry on booth occasions. The only salvageable part if the meal was the collards. Not enough to bring me back to Milton Rd. #disappointed"
4,First time coming here and they really do have Great customer service the guys that work here are super nice and inviting! Came here for date night with my hubby and had fun. Purchase the Groupon they had and it was well worth the purchase.
0,"If I'm judging purely on value, it's a zero star.  The place is just super expensive, and you're paying for faux ambiance instead of quality.  \n\nAsk yourself - why am I going to this restaurant?\n\nIf your answer is food, try Smashburger.  If your answer is that you want sake-infused hockey pucks of beef, then sit down and enjoy your overpriced Grade D meat."
1,"Disappointing on several levels.  First, the good news.  Service was incredible as was the ginger beer thyme infused cocktail.  Order it at the bar and don't venture any further.  Now onto the bad news.  Octopus appetizer that everyone raves about?  Over spiced and served with a tentacle so huge it looked like a prop from a Richard Basehart submarine movie.  Back off on the salt boys.  It was pickled in it.  Bone in ribeye was tasty but greasy as were the short ribs.\n\nBrussels Sprouts reminded me of the crusty remnants of some experimental casserole.  Like what's at the bottom.  Why screw with one of nature's most beautiful foods?  The whipped potatoes were definitely whipped - into a veritable soup that looked more like baby food than a proper side dish.\n\nIf you feel like a steak I'd recommend Stack.  Only a few steps further into the casino with a better menu and ambience.  Did I mention that the music was not dining appropriate and annoying?\n\nI just did."
1,Meh....seems to be dropping off.
0,I booked a nice weekend. So I thought. Worst hotel I have ever stayed at. First I waited over an hour to stand in line to check in. Only to find out I was early and they wanted to charge me 35 bucks. The clerk proceeded to tell me that if I didnt want to pay I could check my bags at the bell desk and wait in another line for 45 mins!!! I then decided to order a cocktail from the hotel. I then brought the cocktail to the pool and was not allowed in the pool area with a drink I purchased from their own hotel!!! I was very unhappy that the pools were grouped by age!!! The pool was the main reason we booked here to find out my child that is 12 had to stay in the kid area with a baby slide! I got up the next morning to get coffee from the coffee shop inside the hotel and I have never been treated so rude and had to reapeat my order 3 times and it was still messed up and because they messed up my drink and forgot the Hazelnut they made me pay an additional 50 cents to add it which I had already paid . I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN! WORST VACATION EXPERIENCE EVER!!!
3,"If you need ice for a party and live in the west valley this is your place.  Can get 20 pound bags for 2.40.  Which is not bad, considering Costco is about 1.70 a bag.  The best part is I don't have to go all the way to Arrowhead to get ice.  Another interesting note is that the owner told me the 20 pound bags are more like 22 pounds.  \n\nThey also sell reverse osmosis, filtered water at .30 a gallon.  Bring your own jugs or you can buy them here.  \n\nWhat really attracted me to this place you ask??  The Thrifty ice cream sign.  I am a sucker for ice cream and it has been years since I have had Thrifty ice cream.  So in I went and enjoyed a scoop of Rocky Road goodness for $1.80 on a cone. \n\nIf you are looking for ice, filtered water, or some ice cream to cool off in Surprise this could be your next destination.  They are open 7:30 to 7 Monday through Friday and Saturday 10 to 5 I believe.  Sunday is a no go so stock up before."
0,Customer service was horrible the cashier was being so rude forgot to charge us for the drinks that I clearly told her I wanted. Then she came back and told us that we need to pay for them if we want them. Well duh! I didn't expect free drinks because of your mistake. The food was  dry and flavorless I've heard so many good things about this restaurant and I came out really disappointed.
0,"I weep for humanity.\n\nWords like \""horrifying,\"" \""embarrassing,\"" and \""tragic\"" should be used when describing this culinary disaster.  Our group of four had to hunt to find anything edible just to get past the meal.  \n\nWe could taste the cheapness in the food.  It was like the dishes were assembled  in another country, frozen, shipped, accidentally thawed, re-frozen and then reheated for the Luxor's unsuspecting dining victims.  \n\nThe Luxor should be ashamed and management should be forced to eat here daily."
3,"This place has delicious Mexican Food! margaritas are good too, not too sweet :) lots of friendly staff, and great service. I would not go there for Happy Hour though, they are only 1.00 off the Margaritas, and you can only sit at the bar area; if its hot hot you have only half the bar available, the indoor side, But for lunch n dinner GREAT!"
4,I ate here before the Thursday night Art Walk on main street. The food was great and the ambiance was nice. MIchael at the bar introduced himself and was great in helping me.   I would definitely eat here again and recommend this place to anyone.
4,Super!  When you team Chef Kelly Fletcher with Sommelier David M Johnson you know you're going to experience magic. Achiote Salmon was a great flavor festival in my mouth.  We also tried the braised short rib which as good as we have ever had. Love the creativity of the food and the large (and well priced) wine list. Check it out!!
1,"It appears to be an okay restaurant, but nothing special and seemingly not worth the price.  I sat at the bar for my first visit and thankfully Nine On Nine has a good happy hour with half price food from the bar menu as well as discounted wine and drinks.  The wine list is pretty good and lots of choices by the glass so that's a positive.  The cocktails didn't look very exciting so I didn't try any cocktails.\n\nAs for food, thankfully I went for half price happy hour dishes because neither the mussels nor the risotto I ordered was would have been worth the full prices of $16 and $14, respectively.  Don't get me wrong, there were a huge number of mussels in the bowl, but they were overcooked and a bit stringy, some hadn't been cleaned properly and were grainy, and the sauce (which is one of my favorite parts of a good mussel dish) didn't add much flavor other than when it soaked into one of the 6 or 7 tiny little crouton-sized pieces of bread that were sprinkled on top of the dish.  The mushroom risotto was fine but nothing special - slightly too al dente and missing salt or something so it just didn't have much flavor.  At $8 and $7 per plate I've had a lot worse, but these dishes definitely weren't worth their full menu prices.  Oh, and the ceviche of the day - which I did not get - was tilapia.  I've rarely ever seen that before - nothing like a cheap, typically muddy tasting fish for a good ceviche...\n\nI may go back and order off the full menu because I can't argue with some nicely chosen wines by the glass for $6 during happy hour - and a lot of people seem to like the food here - but the next visit will confirm whether it's worth ever going back after that.  The prices aren't cheap so my expectations are high and food on my first visit didn't come close to meeting them."
2,"First time in..I'm told they opened last Friday.. doing the research now.. more to come. ...\n\nFollow up :) \n\nSo a friend and I had some drinks, we ate some food.. having not been open long, they were already out of 'signature' items like the pretzels.. so we opted for the potato chip nachos, cheese-steak, and French dip. Nothing bad, nothing great about any one of them. \n\nNachos were good, a little light on the toppings, but tasty. The French dip and the cheese steak were both good and came with fries or cole slaw.\n\nThe service was good, and friendly, and that alone would make me go back. \n\nOtherwise, it's loaded with tv's beer, grub, and drinks.. should do well on the linq. \n\nHappy Eating!"
4,"OMG! This place is awesome...my husband and I were visiting Vegas for work and wanted to eat some good sushi and based on the reviews here, we decided to check this place out...the service was amazing top notch.. Really. I never went to an all you can eat sushi and chefs and waitresses tell you to try everything and this and that... I first thought those items are extra charge since they were asking constantly. But, man this place is great... The fish, the dishes were fresh and tasty... Everyone was so friendly and fun.. Definitely coming back the next time..."
4,"This was our first time renting from Sixt and it was great!  We made our reservation with Sixt because they had the best price for a minivan during spring training. We waited in line less than 10 minutes and the customer service representative was friendly, courteous, and efficient, and there was no pressure to upgrade or take extras that we didn't need, including additional insurance.  Once downstairs, another friendly Sixt employee showed us to our car, which was a clean, new minivan. All in all, a great experience renting from Sixt--we'll definitely use them again."
3,This place is super delicous!!! It is alittle pricey ($50) but oh so worth it for special occasions!\nMy favorites are the lamb chops and leg of lamb. So awesome! I also love the cheese bread buns they give you at the table and also the shrimp at the buffet you have to try! so good!\n\nMy husband and I signed up for their newsletter on the texas de brazil website and got two for one dinners on our bdays and anniversary! \n\nService is always great and the atmosphere is great. \n\nI would say this place is not good for kids. The servers have sharp knives and heavy meats. Not a place for kids at all!
1,"Check it...\n\nI generally loathe restaurants attached to a hotel. \n\nWith the exception of Cleo (one of my favorite spots in LA) inside The Redbury (my favorite hotel in LA). \n\nI don't know what the deal is, but they always look like overstock dot com took a dump in the middle of the room (metallic wall art, turquoise arm chairs, ultra modern textiles) and the food is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I guess because it's in a hotel it needs to be bland enough to please everyone? \n\nIn any case, DSG follows in the footsteps of all the other places I've come across where you can slumber and snack... it's just not good. Not only were they out of 3 menu items (one of them being olives... how do you screw up that order?) but the things they did have weren't great. Cheese curds dripping with oil and flattened like little pancakes. Salumi that though I was told was prepared in house felt like chewing flavorless fat. The tuna wontons were fine. The parmesan fries also fine, but nothing about the experience blew any of us away. Service was awkward, less than informative and not very warm. \n\nI apologize to visitor's to Madison who may not make it out of the hotel to dine. This is not a good representation of what our city has to offer."
2,"Not going to lie, not big on Thai or Chinese food, but I was with others who chose the place and tagged along. I am always good with fried rice, love that stuff, but this kind was not great. The chicken was dry, no egg in it really, and overloaded with onions and scallions that those flavors just kind of took over. \n\nOthers may enjoy, but if you like fried rice do not waste your taste buds on this one. \n\nIn the end the service was good. The family there was really nice and thoughtful and they do have specials, happy hour, and I guess karaoke on some night of the week. \n\nNever hurts to try."
4,"Came here for the first time yesterday. I must say, I was really lost at first. When I found the location, it was inside a doctor's office. Actually, I believe it was shared with two different types of doctor or something to that matter. So when I went it, it was very quiet but there was a sign for Just Waxing at the receptionist counter. When you're a first time customer, you get to fill out a form! \n\nI actually didn't have an appointment but I was a very lucky gal! Kelly had some free time after she finished with her client and took me right in. I only needed to get my eyebrows waxed so it was fairly easy. \n\nWhen she took me into her room, it was clean and neat. It was a very organized room and very simple. It didn't take her long to wax my eyebrows and during it, she made some small talk. She asked me a few questions and got to know me a little bit. I had told her where I worked and it turns out she has a lot of clients that also work in the same place so it was pretty cool. \n\nIn the end, no complaints. Did a pretty good job. Was quick and efficient. Takes cash and card. You pay before you leave the room which is cool. RIGHT ON THE SPOT HAHA. It was $15 for my eyebrows I believe. Will probably come back when I need to get them shaped again. Thanks Kelly! \n\nPS: Just remember to make an appointment if you do decide to give her a try. Luck won't happen every time! Derppp"
0,"I live in north central Phoenix, and one night after payday had a hankering to go buy me some makeup. So I headed up to the closest Ulta, and was going to initially stop by L&L to buy me and the hubs some Hawaiian bbq for dinner.\n\nExcept Fresh Wasabi caught my eye. Now keep in mind the sign's a bit misleading- the first thing that catches your eye says 'bento box.' Not Fresh Wasabi. But you know, I'm always down for Japanese food. The place had a decent amount of people in it, and perusing the menu I saw two things that immediately caught my eye- ramen and bulgogi. I love the former, my husband the latter. So why not? I order me some ramen, get him the bulgogi bowl, and get us a cali roll to enjoy as well. \n\nThe food came out promptly. That was... really about the only good thing here on out. \n\nMy biggest beef (no pun intended) was how they packaged my ramen. They kept the broth and the noodles in two separate Styrofoam bowls. Pretty standard procedure. But they they proceed to stack my noodles and broth, my husband's bulgogi bowl AND the cali roll one on top of the other in some precarious leaning tower of take out asian food. It was a disaster waiting to happen. But I totter out with this tower of food tied up in a plastic bag, and proceed to drive the 5 or so miles home as carefully as I could. \n\nNo luck. The thing topples over at the first light I gently pull to a stop at, and by the time I get home and bring the plastic bag in I realize that my broth is no longer in my styrofoam bowl, but all over the bottom of the plastic bag. \n\nThank god for good plastic bags. At least they invested in those, because the lids on the soup bowl sure weren't up to par. The weight of everything else on top of the broth bowl broke the lid, and the braking did the rest. Soup got into our cali rolls, but NOT my noodles. My husband's bulgogi bowl escaped largely unscathed, but that didn't save it. It was bland and not very much like bulgogi. The cali roll was also, even without being soggy, mediocre and bland. And the mayo in the krab-mayo mix was yellow. Why, oh why? \n\nNow I'll take credit where credit's due. I SHOULD have asked to repackage the stuff. But even without the soup disaster, which I did try to put aside, the food was bland, mediocre, and not very authentic. \n\nAll in all, a disaster. Maybe you'll have better luck eating in, but if the food was anything like what I took home that day just pass and go to L&L or Panda instead. You'll enjoy that more."
1,"Highly disappointed with our dining experience last night. I'd say that for the amount of money that we spent, we could've gotten a much better meal somewhere else. When we got to the restaurant, they told us it was going to be about a 15-30 minute wait ... we got our table in about 5 minutes. Good start! We were browsing through the menu & trying to make a decision during which time our waiter came by twice & asked if we had any questions. We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.\n\nWe decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.\n\nLastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.\n\nWe did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening! Overall, I'd say that if it was worth the money, I would go back to Pappadeaux's for the salmon; based on this experience, however, it's not likely that we'll be going back."
2,"Ok so the suite was nice with the jetted tub, etc.  My main issues was with billing and customer service.  Since the billing issue so overshadows the stay I would be careful to stay here again.\n\nLet me explain and you decide:\n\nI left my debit for the deposit on the room...3 days later total was charged on my debit card! What makes this worse is that the room was already paid for so they charged for the room twice.  It took 4 days to get my money back from Caesars.  Learn from my mistake and use a credit card for your deposit card for your room.  Luckily I had the cash to cover it in my account or I would have been broke for 4 days waiting for my refund from here."
1,"Valentine's evening 2013, my wonderful husband surprised me with dinner at this restaurant as we had never been to either the Stratosphere or the restaurant before. I was so looking forward to a wonderful evening with one of my bestest friends and my wonderful husband. Unfortunately the experience as a whole left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a combination of the Management of the facility as well as another diner in the restaurant that honestly I wish I was able to confront for ruining such a wonderful evening.\n\nWithout letting that situation put a bias on my review of their food, it was mediocre at best and seriously over-priced for what we had tried to consume before being rudely interupted by the manager. It seems that one of the other diners near us were offended by our laughter and enjoyment, enthusiasm for being together, and certain words that were spoken at my table. The manager then approached our table, looked at me directly and asked that we refrain from these activities immediately. Now please keep in mind I spent well over 200 dollars for dinner and had not even been served as yet. I promptly requested to know whom had made such a request of us, as I intended to embarass and humiliate them as they had done to me. Maybe not the best approach but honestly - who in their right mind is so narcassistic to believe that they are allowed to go out in Public then mandate that the Public behave in the way they deem they should? If you are so easily offended by others, stay at home and don't ever leave.\n\nBack to dinner, I gathered my things, my 25 dollar valentine's day dinner picture, my BFF and left my husband to deal with getting our dinner to go. We had split some of the meal with my friend so he had 2 cards and some cash he wanted to give towards the dinner with the intent of giving cash to the waitress after the transaction as a tip (we prefer tipping in cash as we believe the servers are not taxed on this and get to keep more of it - if that makes sense). I am not real clear on what the cash portion my husband provided was for as I think he had wanted to get change from it but it seems the waitress took it upon herself not to return 20 dollars of that cash. Funny, she was going to receive a much larger tip than 20 dollars as she was excellent, it was her manager that was the jerk, but just taking the money and not returning it, allowed us to assume thats all she thought she deserved and we did not offer anything more. \n\nAll in all, as I indicated, the food really wasn't all that compared to other places we have been to with similar offerings. The price was not fitting of the quality of food, the service was excellent but that last little action was uncalled for. The manager needs a class in people skills and the only real redeeming quality this place has is that it sits at the top of the Stratosphere, spins and provides a nice view of the strip when your table finally gets there. If it was just an observation deck with a bar it could have been a much better place to go. Overall I was pretty bummed that this place seems to get a lot of hype but really is disappointing in the end."
1,"Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nCame on a Thursday night to watch a football game.     Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.\n\nI sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.\n\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.\n\nWithin another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.\n\n\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.\n\n  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \""get it whenever we're ready\"", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \n\n  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \n\n\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         \n\n\n   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  \n\n\nI'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.     No thanks."
1,"Must say one of the worst buffet I had. The foods had limited favors, not much of a selection and please don't try their Pho! Dessert I must say was great."
2,"The good:\n\n* Beer specials - Each night there is a draft beer available in a 24 ounce mug for 4 dollars.\n* Wings - Try the spicy garlic. You can get them baked if you like it that way too.\n* TVs - Tons of them and booths have them as well. Always lots of sports on if that's your thing.\n* Bartenders - Easy on the eyes and usually friendly, unless you're a drunk/creepy guy.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* Waitresses - Usually overworked on busy nights, it can take a few minutes to be served or get another drink. Order a pitcher or a 24 ounce mug to avoid waiting long times between service, or if halfway done with a drink and the waitress comes by, order another drink early. Words to live by if you go to a busy bar/restaurant.\n\n* Music - Local music is more often a miss than a hit. Just be aware that sometimes it happens and if you can avoid it you should. Plus it takes away the shuffleboard and pool table area, so those won't be useable during a band.\n\n* Karaoke - I like a good round/night of karaoke but the nights they have it are usually pretty bad. Maybe I've just been unlucky and been there on especially drunken nights. Either way it was hard to sit through. (shots helped though)\n\n* Rowdy Sports Fans - Sometimes things get a bit crazy here during big games, so be prepared if you go on such a night. Big cheap beers and really excited sports fans sometimes means a super loud and occasionally obnoxious environment."
2,"This restaurant has changed owners once again.  We were told the new owner of Gina's was the previous owner of the Roma Deli Restaurant on Spring Mountain and that they had the same chef.  Food was good, not the same as I had enjoyed at Roma Deli, just different.  Yes, it is well worth a visit, you will enjoy their food.   My one issue, my entree was delivered on a cold plate!!  Not even room temp, damn right cold!  I mentioned this to our waiter, he acknowledged it, and apologized.  Our next visit, my entree again, delivered on a cold plate!  What kind of chef doesn't heat the plates?\nDisappointed."
1,"I have to say ... I was not impressed. The food was all pretty good and it looks like they have some good drink and other specials. But the regular menu is over- and haphazardly priced. We had pot stickers ($6), Kobe beef skewers (the Tapas special for the day and the best dish of the night and reasonably priced at $11) and flat noodles with chicken ($11 but a small portion). We also ordered some hot and sour soup which I haven't tried yet because it never arrived until we were finished with all our other food. The waitress said the delay was because the soup was \""made to order.\"" Regardless, I had her wrap it up and was frankly a bit shocked that $15 ($11 for the soup and an extra $4 I wasn't expecting for the shrimp option) bought me about 1 pint of soup. Some stuff seemed reasonably priced but the chicken dish and soup were overpriced - the soup ridiculously so. The hip ambiance just ain't worth that! Sorry - next time I'm paying half the price and getting twice as much food at the decidedly unhip (but dependable) China Chili down the street."
2,"I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. \n\nRandom musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. \n\nThe highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. \n\nFor where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor."
2,"I'm not sure why, but their barbeque sauce doesn't ring true for me.  There seems to be a slight watery tang there that shouldn't be..  So just 3 stars for me, but I LOVE their beans!  If I had my way, I'd get beans from there and get the meat from somewhere else..  :\\"
0,"I feel bad giving this location such a low rating because like everyone in the city I know almost one person at every coffee shop here. I understand the stress of this job, but I also understand what goes on behind the counter. My husband worked at Buffalo & Lake Mead for 5 years. \n\nMy problem with this location is this. \n1) Drive thru. I refuse to go to this drive thru anymore because they simply do not follow their own policy. Starbucks has a 3 minute per car policy. Ex, if there are two cars in line, the second car should be out of the drive thru in six minutes. This location, that does not happen. I have waited over 20 minutes.... 20 minutes with one car in front. I watch to see if they are just an obnoxious person who ordered way too many drinks through the drive thru but that was not the case. Then I ask at the window you know, what happened? whats the hold up? You're not busy... They just ignore the question take my money and send me off. \n\n2) They dont understand their computers. Like I said, I have never worked at starbucks. But I know the computer just from ordering and listening to people become trained on it. I know that there is an option for milk for extra (like in a chai) or for creamer. They ALWAYS first charge me for extra soy, even though its just CREAMER. There I have to sound like the ass correcting them, but thats almost a dollar extra. They then stop and THINK about what theyre doing and act like they are new at their jobs and never were taught that. (bullshit)\n\n3) My drink is always wrong. Now I dont want to sound like one of those stuck up valley girls in all this. But my drink is probably the most simple drink ever. A venti iced coffee, with 2 pumps of white moca and some soy creamer to top it off. \npump pump, coffee, ice, milk... not hard... A standard iced coffee comes with 6 pumps of whatever you order or the standard sweetener. Its disgustingly sweet and turns into McDonalds coffee thus why I specifically one ask for 2. I always repeat myself twice, and get a repeat from them so they understood me correctly.\n\nThey still fail. Somehow I really do not realize how. \n\nMost of the people working here are little teeny boppers still in high school. Which I did think was a good job for young kids, but not here. They're ruining this location. They need better training and to work harder and faster. They do not take their job seriously.\n\nThe manager however was very kind when speaking with her. She did compliment us 2 drinks, but I will not be spending money on this location anymore. Like I said, Lake Mead & Buffalo is where it is at. \n\nI'm done ranting now."
1,I guess I really just dont like buffets in this town.  The prime rib was so salty.  I would stay away just pay the extra money and hit the steak house.
1,"No improvement since my last Update!  I still come in with a list of 10 things I need, all of which they carry, and they will be out of 2 to 4 of them, in any department!  Today I needed certain batteries, which they carry.  There are 3 battery kiosks in the store, but sure enough, all 3 of them were out of the ones I need!\n\nQuiz:  What two items DOES this Walmart always have plenty of, out on the sales floor?\n\nAnswer:  Empty hooks and trays WHERE THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE MERCHANDISE FOR SALE!!\n\nWill they EVER get new management for this second worst run*  Walmart in the Valley??     :-O\n`\n\n* After 35th Av. & Bethany Home!     :-O   :-O"
3,"I love Korean BBQ and this place won't disappoint you. their food is very tasty and they offer different options for everyone. we ordered a \""combo\"" for two which included a soda or rice alcohol drink (kind of strong) and 3 different types of meats.  They are also open extended hours. \nservice: Fair\nprep time: 8 Min\natmosphere:  relaxing, good place to enjoy with a group of friends\nBest Thing: at the end of your BBQ meal you can enjoy some fried rice.\nworst thing: they do not offer a lot of the small sides that other Korean restaurants have\nPrice: one of the best prices in town"
4,Tops in quality! Tops in customer service! I highly recommend this shop for everyone. Have used them twice and very happy.
4,"I recently needed A/C repair on a Monday morning following the first really\nhot weekend in Phoenix.  Apparently, a LOT of other people needed A/C repair, also.\nMy regular repairman was unavailable.  I called A/C Guys, Inc.  (found on Yelp)\nThis was a rental property.  An appointment needed to be scheduled with the tenant, while keeping me (the landlord) aware of what was going on.  Payment needed to be scheduled with me.  Technician needed to inform both the tenant and me as to what was going on with the A/C.  A/C Guys handled all of this with ease, and kept me informed\nat all times. So easy.  \nIn addition, the technician (Matt) gave me two options for repair (I have never had THAT happen before - nice).  In the office (Ty) coordinated it all, and e-mailed me a receipt.\nProfessional business, honest, great repair, and affordable prices.  I highly recommend this business, and will continue to use A/C Guys, Inc. in the future."
2,"Place is OK but I have to be honest I'm not gastro-pub's fan. Drinking a beer and smell of burgers all of the time, it isn't perfect match for me.... but if you like..."
2,"I ate here alone, with Groupon.  I ordered a bowl $5.95 of creamy butternut squash soup, which was REALLY GOOD.   It was probably the best butternut squash soup I ever had.   I can tell there was lotsa butter in it, and cumin.  But there was not much soup on in the rather flat bowl.  It really made me wonder how much less soup they put in a \""cup\"" for $3.95, cos I think the \""bowl\"" is a cup of soup poured into a bowl.  I cannot believe that my bowl was more than a cup of soup.  \n\nAlso ordered $14.95 Meat Lovers pizza to make my bill at least $20.  All pizzas are the same size, which I measured with a ruler to be 11\"".   I won't come back to Humble Pie because I think it is expensive for the little portion that you get for the money.  I like \""value\"", which is not here at Humble Pie.   1/3 of the pizza is the crust, which has nothing on it, so the pizza is even smaller.   Taste is good tho.  \n\nI feel the best value for pizza is the House Special at Mellow Mushroom in Tempe.  $20.79 for 14\"" and loaded high and dense with ingredients, best of which is the applewood bacon. \n\nMy server, Jon, was very attentive and polite.   When I was amazed they had cloth napkins for greasy pizza, he brought he larger paper napkins, because I went over to the bar and got myself bar paper napkins.  He brought whatever I asked for, lemon wedges and Sweet and Low (I make my own lemonade), more water."
3,"This review is not about the food but the slamming ultra lounge that is The Cathouse.\n\nIf you like house music in a less crowded atmosphere where you can actually socialize with people, this is the lounge for you.\n\nDrinks are very fairly priced.  Hostesses are very professional delivering incredible service (yeah they are also hot but this is not one of those clubs).\n\nMake some local friends and get in without cover.\n\nCheck the Luxor website before you head out to the lounge.  There are different themes during the week including a hip-hop and an \""alternative lifestyle\"" night."
0,"I usually like to give compliments to show a hard working person or company some love, but after my experience at this wild house, I had to confirm the negative reviews. After straightening out my messed up reservation, I proceeded to my room that I was told overlooked the pool, and after taking a look out the window, my \""pool\"" view overlooked the parking garage. \nThe advertised flat screen was on old television, the hot water was down the first night, no fridge or coffee makers and water cost $3-5. Just go outside the hotel get your water for way cheaper. \nEverything reeks of smoke; the hallways, the elevators, every corner of the casino! I got aa free and unwanted audio session of the couple next to me have a morning quicky at 8:45 a.m. (moans , groans, skin slapping, etc) and had to crank up ESPN loud in order to get rid of the noise. No shuttles, so if you aren't driving , prepare to spend or bring your running shoes.\nThe people selling stuff on your way to the room get annoying quick and you can tell this hotel only cares about bottom dollar. The employees at the deli and Rock & Ritas are pretty cool but overall the Place is a dump!\nStay away from this place!"
4,"great place, great vibes"
1,"not a fan.  the food was meh, the service was horrible.  went there for lunch today with a small group, ordered an appetizer for all to share and each ordered an individual dish.  i also ordered an ice tea - they were out.  i believe this has to be a first for a thai place.  \n\none of our dishes came out about 15 minutes of waiting, still no appetizer.  finally after about  30-40 minutes the appetizer came out followed by the other two dishes spaced out about 5 minutes apart.  ???  lunch took  about 1 1/2 hours and the taste wasn't worth the time it would take at panda.  f this place.  don't go."
3,"I never did get to try that Ostrich Burger :(. O well.\n\nSo this is the place my friend and I always eat at while waiting for connecting rides at the nearby MegaBus route. Thank god it is so close, because Pittsburgh is a ghost town and there pretty much is no where else aside from fast food to eat. \n\nTheir fries, sweet potato, or regular, are awesome. Get extras if you can!\nThe burgers, sandwiches, etc all do the trick. I get some turkey sandwich with an excellent honey mustard sauce and sliced apples on it. Never though to put straight up apple on my meat, but it is something different and really tasty.\n\nFriendly staff, usually adorning accents and food wisdom. Ask them for help. \n\nThey also always let us loiter in their seating area for hours after, utilizing the free wi-fi.\n\nThank you Sharp Edge for making lay-over so smooth!"
3,"I'm pretty easy when it comes to buffets.  I only have a few requirements:  (1) a clean dining room, (2) fresh and tasty crab legs and fried chicken and (3) mind-blowingly good sweet treats.  Carnival World Buffet satisfies all three with added extras like a great dim sum and fried food section.  Loved the fried food: fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried scallops and onion rings!! Crab legs were juicy and tasty and the fried chicken wings were great.\n\nAnd I couldn't help but come back to get more sweet treats like their mint chocolate chip gelato with warm chocolate bread pudding and their bananas foster.  \n\nHighly recommended."
2,"This location has been through a few iterations over the years, but it is now known as Shari's.  From what I read in the local paper (http://www.lvrj.com/news/40836542.html) it is a family owned and operated establishment.  Upon entering, you can confirm this, as it feels like it.  The staff was very friendly.  I went on a Sunday ~11am, and the place was jumping.  Could have been because of the recent write-up in the RJ, but they said that weekend business has been brisk for awhile now.  I had the monstrous breakfast sandwich (it has a funny name that escapes me right now), the wife had a burger, and the kids had pancakces.  All was quite good, and nothing felt fake or processed.  I am growing tired of the places that just deep fry everything.  Not this place.  \n\nI went for lunch a few days later, had their classic burger, and it too was quite good.  They have a sauce with it that is tasty, and they didn't bat an eye when I asked for gravy-fries (I think it must be an East Coast thing).  The Chicken Vegetable soup was really excellent, probably the best part of the meal.  Very fresh, seasoned just right.\n\nI reserve 5 stars for only my favorite haunts, which would leave them at 4 stars.  I took one star away, because I feel like when the bill was tallied, it felt a little pricier than it seemed going in.  Thus they get 3, which is still good in my book.  Oh, one last thing, they use great buns!  Not dry and stale like the stuff you get at some places."
1,Twice I've been to their pharmacy trying to get fairly common prescriptions filled (antibiotic for sinus infection and an anti-fungal cream) and twice I've arrived to pick up my 'script only to be told that they don't have the item in stock. One time they kept me waiting for 45 minutes with a sick child before they told me they didn't have what I need. Customer service was terrible and the pharmacy staff could have cared less. I won't be going back.
3,"We love sushi and we have been to some of the best sushi places in most of the major cities in the US and Canada. We are always looking for good sushi at a good price. So after getting a discounted gift certificate from restaurant.com we decided to try Cafe Wasabi. It's located in a strip mall but is nicely appointed inside. We spent a good while looking at the countless rolls available which were all pictured across the counter. This is perfect for those people who like to see what they are about to eat. We ordered a several different rolls and nigiri to sample it all. \nWe spent about $70 for a two adults and 2 small kids. Good thing we had that gift certificate. Overall, the sushi was very good and the service was good. Again they have a great selection to choose from and I am looking forward to sampling more of the options."
3,Another great Fox Concepts Restaurant...no surprise here!  The space is absolutely great - amazingly bright and open.  The service is extremely quick at lunch which is much appreciated.  And...the food was great!  My pasta was flavorful and just the right portion.  I am confident this place will be a huge success and imagine it is pretty hard to get a table at peak times.
2,"This place is really a busy location.  I walked in for an MRI expecting a similar experience to West Valley Imaging.  I was way off.  This was so much more crowded.  I started in one waiting area where I signed in and waited to be called up for paper work.  When I was called up I was moved to a second waiting room where I completed my paper work and waited to be called up again.  I was called up after a few minutes and processed in their computer system.  I sat back down and waited until I was called into yet another waiting room.  Waiting room #3.  I sat there for several minutes before I was brought a clip board with more paper work and two hospital gowns to change into.  I changed and completed my paperwork and watched several other people get called in before me.  I'm pretty sure some of them got there after me but I can look past that.  I did take some valium to get me through the scan so maybe they were waiting for it to take affect.  When I finally got called back to the MRI I climbed up on the table, put my head in a cage that made me feel not unlike Hannibal Lecter, and was slowly inserted into the tube.  It only lasted 15 minutes.  I was expecting to be in there a lot longer. I didn't even need the valium with how short a time I was in.  Whatever.  At least I made it through.  Steinberg may have a machine that I consider superior to the one West Valley but they herd you like cattle from one room to the next.  Its a little ridiculous."
2,"The epicenter ale is very good.  We just had to take some home so we ordered a six pack to go.  This place is a lot like Four Peaks in Tempe except  the food is a little more expensive (beer prices are similar though).  The food isn't as good as Four Peaks so we will go there over this place from now on but I wouldn't tell people to stay away...try it, it's OK"
2,"Good location and atmosphere. We had dinner on the lower level next to the jazz singer which was nice.\n\nFood quality varied - the soup was great, the shrimp appetizer and the fish entree were good, salad nicoise was very bad - they first forgot the boiled egg, but were apologetic upon being reminded and brought us a couple of eggs on the side,  and the tuna tasted like chunks of salt. \n\nService was decent but quite slow. We were there for over 2 hours for dinner. Overall a mixed experience, and it wouldn't be at the top of our list of Montreal restaurants we'd revisit."
2,"Meh.  Aside from people crowding around your car to \""hand wash\"" it, it's a pretty average car wash. \n\nThey'll probably get more gunk off your car than a machine or touchless wash, but there will be huge risk of scratches and \""spiderwebbing\"" because they use the dirtiest wash mitts I've ever seen. \n\nIf you love your paint, hand wash it yourself or use a touchless wash. \n\nIf you dont't care too much and don't like washing your own car take it here."
4,I thougt is was pretty good...Im wondering if some of the negative review are from the restaurant and bar right next door... I love that place too but I wouldnt put it past their regular patrons.
3,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to eat here. I've walked past Spice Island for years but never went in. Maybe its because it's surrounded by ramshackle student housing on Atwood street, but honestly don't judge by the exterior.\n\nInside is warm and inviting with low lighting and intimate tables. For drinks, there is a limited wine and beer list and also house specialty cocktails. The cocktails intrigued me the most so I went with the Gin Gin Mule (6.50) and wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe menu is extensive. Both my date and I went with noodle dishes. I went with the Singapore Rice Noodles while she ordered the \""famous\"" Pad Thai. Both hit the mark and the Pad Thai lived up to its hype. The Singapore Noodles could have been a little spicier but the friendly waitstaff brought out hot sauce which helped with the spice level.\n\nFor appetizers we went with the vegetable spring roll and the deep fried hard boiled egg. The rolls didn't stand out any more than other places around town, but the fried egg was intriguing. If you like hard boiled eggs I would recommend this variation. \n\nFor a couple drinks, apps, and two entrees the bill was somewhere between 50 and 60 dollars."
1,"Normally I don't give 2 star's but I am going to give this over hyped buffet one for the first time being that I'm a buffet lover and have experience in tons of them to compare to.\n\nFirst off this is as I seen one if not the most expensive buffet's in town right now with myself paying $48 to get in even with a player's card.\n\n2nd off I have no clue how they got 500 dishes out of the mixture there is no way by far 500 dishes in this buffet there is the same amount of selection from stateion to station as any other typical big buffet in Vegas maybe there trying to hype up the fact you can CUSTOMIZE a dish up to 500 ways but either way I'm not buying it because I was expecting to see once again THE KING OF BUFFET'S here!\n\nLet's say the quality was very poor, the rice in some dishes tasted like rice in a bag, the Italian food was very bland nothing interesting or unique especially the meat balls tasted like frozen freezer selection. They didn't even serve steak so I had to settle on pork chops also that were very cheap in quality.. just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on quality and selection.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the place and the server was a very nice gentleman which I tipped him accordingly but other then that I'll never return."
3,"Very small theater- but very inexpensive tickets and snacks. This place is usually empty, yet regularly get's the latest blockbusters. \n\nI'm a big fan, but if it came to a blockbuster action masterpiece like Dark Knight, I would head elsewhere to an Imax or larger screen."
4,"I love the food at all of Los Dos Molinos restaurants. It is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the WORLD.   I have never had a bad meal here.  Also, their food is excellent.  HOT but excellent.  Their salsa is hot and delicious and margaritas are pretty great too.  I usually stick with the enchilada plate most of the time.  Although the ribs and chili beans are excellent too if you can take the heat.  Also the place is run by the family and you can usually find one of them any given day at the restaurant eager to please."
2,"***disclaimer: my friend Melissa B. loves this place (please see her review). I think the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I have gone with her and she's a damn good time!***\n\nWith that disclaimer being said, I had an good time there. I mean, the music wasn't bad, and if you have a table, it's a lot more enjoyable. I do like the decor, it's really nicely done inside, and has some pretty decent people watching. I also love the fact that it's very close to my house.\n\nNice stuff said, now it's time for the criticism: it's somewhat ridiculous. A bit pretentious and too expensive!! Cheapest glass of wine: $9. Martinis: $12. My poor friend had $12 vodka red bull. This is not the place to go if you're looking to get a little sloshed or are not a cheap date. \n\nI will go there again, yes, because my friends LOVE it (see Eric P.'s review as well) and it makes me feel like I'm in a chicago lounge. But, I think my warnings should be heard. :)"
1,"Had a groupon decided to check it out, steak was good, server was lacking. It was busy and loud which wasn't bad but it was our first time there, so we weren't familiar withthe menu. Some of us had steak and some had salmon. The salmon came with sides and the steak did not. I wish the server would have told us more about the menu or asked if we wan't sides. The server checked in once and never offered anyone a refill of their drinks.  It felt like they were put out by the groupon and didn't want to deal with us. Prob won't return."
3,"Fabulous drinks, delicious food.  Timing out of the kitchen could improve.  Our server Kelley was fun."
3,"If you're visiting Vegas this is a really great place to check out. It's pretty much like a lounge/bar. This place is Beautiful inside and out! The music they played was awesome too. It's located in the Palms Hotel and Casino. The best part is the view! You are up as high as I believe something like 50 stories, and you can see the entire view of the strip. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing that's all I can say. \nIt did lose a star because it's doesn't have a dance area...but it's still worth checking out."
1,"While the atmosphere is nice and the decor is comprised of stuff I'd like to see in my own home, the food is greatly over rated (and over priced) here. The enchiladas were sub-par and the tacos \""were the worst I'd ever had\"" according to my boyfriend's review of the pork tacos (and he's a man who knows his pork tacos). For about $17 (including tip) you can get one margarita (I've had better) and somewhat crappy Mexican food. Ouch. I will say their appetizer size spare rib Chile taquitos were alright, but they were not a full meal nor were they worth the nine dollars we spent on them. Wonderful, attentive service though so bravo to the staff!"
3,Went here last weekend. First thing they seat you and bring you pickles. This was very interesting. The food was great. Service was great. Breakfast menu has a lot of options. Will go back often. Ok have been back a few times lately and the food was not good. Came out cold both times and portions are smaller. Will be a long time till I go back.
4,"The salon was awesome. I was from out of town and thought I'd get a much needed haircut while my boyfriend had a business meeting. I called up and they squeezed me in. Allison was great! She has a happy personality and really enjoyed working with my hair and both showed. She really listened and stuck to to what I wanted, explained her techniques and taught me some new ways to get a great blowout. Her blowouts are fabulous...I have thick wavy hair and usually get a Deva cut but it was a treat to get a blunt cut and a blowout. Two days later the cut still looks great even though I wear it wavy. I'm in Vegas once or twice a year for work and will definitely come back again next time."
4,"Yummy! Had the larger cheese burger and it was delish. Hot, juicy and fresh. Staff is passionate about their product and so friendly and happy. Ordering is super easy and we were served quickly. Cute patio area to enjoy a nice glass of vino. I am only able to eat grass fed beef and this is my new favorite spot. Will definitely be coming back. And....the frozen custard was fabulous!"
0,"Complete rip off artists! I reserved a 1 bedroom jr Penthouse suite facing the strip with a patio on the 30th floor for $148.00 a night. When I arrived I was given a studio on the 30th floor facing the strip with NO patio. I called Blue Chip and spoke to Krystal. Not only was she rude and unprofessional she hung up on mean because she said I was mad. I called back and she told me that's what I reserved and if I wanted a 1 bedroom it would be $50.00 more a night. After fighting with her about this for 30 minutes I was left with no choice but to pay the extra. No refunds. She gave me a filthy, dirty 1 bedroom on the 17th floor facing the pool, not the strip. We heard Techno music all day from the pool. \nI could have stayed in a brand new clean room at The Cosmopolitan for $200.00 more. \nI talked to people at the front desk and they said they get complaints from this co. all the time. After I got home I noticed I was charged an additional charge. I have to fight to get this charge back.\nStay away from this company if you don't want to get ripped off like I did."
4,"I went to Alex with dark brown, short, damaged, choppy hair. After one visit she took me the perfect shade of blonde and put in gorgeous extensions. She blended the hair perfectly that people don't even know my real length. She takes such good care of me as her client and I'm beyond grateful I found her!"
2,"This was a funny place to end up on a night out with sixty (and then some) co-workers from our Amsterdam office. It was not beautiful but it was fun to go to with such a big group of different people. Very accessible, love the music. Ceiling's to low. Or maybe us dutchies are too tall. Either way; funny place! \u00a310 is a reasonable entrancw price (allthough we spent a sh*tload of money the night before, how about some discount next time?)"
4,"Awesome service and awesome prices, Work was done in quick and professional matter.....will defiantly use them again."
1,"After living in the Las Vegas valley for several years and have never gone to Hot and Juicy Crawfish. Now I can say that I went. But I won't be back. The food was good  the atmosphere great, the service is what is lacking. We were seated and then asked if we wanted anything to drink, I said no because I would like to see the menu. Well no one came .  We waited and waited.  I said we would wait 2 more mintues and then we would leave.  Finally were served.  Food took forever even though tables that were seated after us received their dinner before us. I never knew who my server was. They all asked or stopped by the table. But never when I needed them. It's too bad."
4,"This place is awesome!!!!  They have fun cocktails, so make sure to sample a couple.  For starters, you simply must get the duck fat fries!  They are the best I've had and the 110 minute egg they are served with is sooooo good!  For dinner our table ordered the lamb burger, seared ahi and the slow roasted beef - all entrees were delicious.  The lamb burger was my favorite. For dessert we had the butterscotch boudino and it was so incredible that I can't wait to go back and have another.  We will definitely return!"
1,"We decided to eat here since we're staying at the Luxor. Actually we just got done eating! Food was excellent! We had the beef burrito and fish burrito. Probably one of the best I've had so far. But service..... what service? Our waiter never came by. My glass was empty the whole time I was there. When we were done, we had to wait 15 min to ASK for our checks. Then another 15 to get the check. He never checked on us, never asked if we needed anything, never said thank you or anything! He put the check on the table and straight up left. We tipped zero dollars! Worst service ever! Two stars for the awesome food!"
2,"Alright, just stopped in about a week ago to check out Monta after they were shut down a little while back.\n\nThe service was considerably slower now.  We had to wave them down just to order, and the food took waaaay longer than it used to....Probably due to them having much more strict food prep and storage, but it took a lot longer now than it ever used to be for everything.\n\nBut the biggest disappointment was the ramen itself.  This used to be my favorite bowl in town, but something changed....for the worse.\n\nTonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen with butter and corn :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#q5T-X6g2S1AzgJT4FT0Vrg\n\nIt tastes a lot more \""instant\"" now and the broth doesn't have that same depth that used to drive me crazy.  I even added butter and corn, and it still wasn't as flavorful as the other big dogs in town.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad Ramen, but it isn't notable anymore to me.\n\nPre-shut down, this place was great.  Now, I doubt I will be coming back anytime soon."
4,"GREAT FOOD and SERVICE!!! I would recommend Barro's Pizza to anyone and everyone! I didn't think I would like it at first, since it is a franchise, but I was wrong, the food is great! Everyone that has waited on me has always been polite and eager to help. They always double check to make sure they have to order correct. If you want Great Food and Great Service, go to Barro's!!!"
0,"Expensive ($23pp!), and not good.  Nothing flows or goes together, line is weird & laid out so you start near desserts...just plan weird and not good.  \n\nExample: they had fajita meats (chicken & steak, with some peppers and onions & spices), but no shells of any kind or flavor, no toppings/garnishes...\n\n...at the grill...they had a baked (bone-in) chicken, grilled porkchop or some weird white fish fried and covered in egg...?!  WTH?"
4,"I was staying at the MGM and was looking for a place to eat for lunch and decided on Tap. I had the most amazing salad that was new for the summer. It had arugula, (what I think were) grape tomatoes, peppers, (get this...) watermelon, topped with feta and a vinaigrette. I would never have thought to combine watermelon and arugula but it was delicious and refreshing! Talk about a salad I'll never forget! I also had the chicken tenders after, which were also very savory and tasty. The customer service through out the restaurant was excellent. I was greeted at the front with a smile and my bartender was very attentive to my needs. I shouldn't fail to mention that Tap boasts flat-screen TVs that enclose the restaurant with sports feeds from all over the world. As a sports fan and someone who loves to eat, this place was pretty much perfect for me. But I have to say... That salad was pretty much the deal-sealer for me to have to post about it on Yelp."
4,"Came here for New Years dinner and loved loved! First, they called us ahead to make sure no one had any food allergies since it was a set menu. It's always appreciated when restaurants are mindful as such.\n\nThe layout and space is modern, cozy with the open kitchen being the center of attention. It was a great experience watching what was about to be served at your table. \n\nI'm not so adventurous with meat nor is French food my meal of choice. But everything from the rabbit ravioli to the sweetbreads surf and turf was fabulous! \n\nService was excellent. And they spaced out the courses just right!\n\nI will surely be returning to La Fabrique upon my next trip to Montr\u00e9al! It's a keeper!"
2,"Had plans to go to Zoe's and they were closed due to no power. It was game day so not the best time to go to hickory tavern. Ended up having to sit outside, it was pretty cool out esp in the shade, finally got to move to a table in the sun and it was nice. The food is ok, typical bar stuff, our server was good... I ordered hot tea since i was cold, drank about 1/2 and my friend says 'you realize there is lipstick all over that cup'. gag. They brought another but I felt a manager should have come over or at least they could have removed the tea from my bill.."
4,"Went on a Monday night with a friend who knew the bartender Jeremy so maybe my experience is a little bias, but the service, fiilm, and beer was beyond great. The vintage seats are grimy and probably filled with bed bugs but if you're like most of the hipsters that go here you probably won't care."
4,"I've always had my carpets done by Sears but 702 Carpet Cleaning was by far the best. Alex did a wonderful job. I had my carpets cleaned upstairs and my tiles cleaned and grouted downstairs. Alex was in and out within 3 hours. He was pleasant, professional and it was a pleasure dealing with this company. A++++++"
4,"I went here with my husband on a date night!! Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The place is decorated very nicely and has a modern touch to it. The food was very flavorful, it literally makes you fall in love with it by firing all your tastebuds. t's a little on the expensive side but it's well worth the price. Compared to other high end restaurants the portions here are pretty big.\n\nThe ambiance was very romantic with candle lights and all, I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date.\n\nThe only aspect that was a little lacking was probably the service, but the food was so great that I was happy they weren't bothering me too much."
4,"A valve on my sprinkler system went out, they came out and had it fixed within 30 minutes. Reasonably priced, I recommend and will use them again if the need arises."
1,"Mike really wanted to go to Yard House, despite bad food experiences the first two times he'd been and the fact that it was 20 miles away. Said Mike, \""Yeah, I keep giving them a chance hoping things will change.\""\n\nChuck, the first waiter, was terrific.  Great personality and just a fun guy.  When we got switched to Molly, however, mmm, not so much.  Not her fault really, but she's no Chuck.   \n\nRick's margarita was terrible and they wouldn't re-make it.  Worst was that they had an attitude about the fact it was a crappy drink. Three of us verified that it sucked. \n\nThe pizza appetizer was just ok, at best, and the Chinese something-or-other was bad as well.  As for the entrees, I had the pan seared scallops.  They were undercooked and the mosh stuff in the middle (oro pasta plus god-knows-what) wasn't very appealing either.  \n\nI absolutely would not recommend this place to any friends and if Eck insists on going back there again, I'll stage a mini-coup and vote him down."
1,"I recently relocated from Houston where there is two Del friscos, one is the Eagle and the other grille I believe. I am a rewards member and know how and what to expect from the staff at a Del Friscos and my experience here was horrible. \n\nThe hostess was a gem and seated us anywhere we wanted that was available,  but the waiter Brent was a incompetent jackass. I immediately knew what appetizers I wanted and he asked if I wanted to see the prices on the menu first, lmao. I was thinking this was a joke. I had to call him over several times because he seemed to be distracted by the business men at the table over. He must've thought he would get more bang for his buck if he attended to them and not me and my date. \n\nThe food is and always will be great and Del friscos as a whole is amazing, but when I tried to escalate this to management and he advised I would receive a gift card in the mail. (Only to realize upon me checking the status of that he was let go from the company) . This has left a horrible taste in my mouth about the Phoenix. If in Houston please visit the one off of kirby, they will treat you like family."
3,"The all you can eat sushi menu is pretty extensive. At $26 for dinner it is right on par with other sushi places I have been to. The sushi is fresh, the steaks and meats are tender and juicy, and the appetizers like the gyoza and seaweed salad are tasty. The calamari could use some work in the flavor department however. The service there is second to none. You are greeted when you walk in by nearly all of the staff, the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive, and the bus staff makes sure your table isn't cluttered with plates and your drinks are never empty. The wait for the sushi can get a little long, so order up some appetizers and sides while you're waiting. Just remember that there are other tables waiting for sushi, and only a few sushi chefs to make all the sushi so patience is a virtue here."
0,"I don't review places often, but felt in this situation this place needed to be placed back in reality. Yes, they do display fun designs on instagram and overall seem to have a pretty good review, I am just going off of my experience. I had a scheduled trip home for the holidays and decided to give this place a shot. For one it was not relaxing and the two woman working near me were talking amongst themselves about the other female customer (of course not in english). Pedicure did not even come close to what you would get at any other salon. I still had dry skin and it wasn't a relaxing, massage experience I was expecting. The thing that caused me to write the review was when I left and two hours later both big toes completely smudged due to gooey, thick polish. I called the salon- they said they do not guarantee polishes, just 7 days for gel. I said that was fine, most places don't, but they would normally fix a mistake especially within the first few hours. They told me to call back early tomorrow to talk to a manager. I did, manager wasn't there and was going to call me back that afternoon. Nothing. Called the next day same thing. Basically, I never heard from them again and then to make it even better my gel manicure chipped in two places within the 4th-6th day. A regular pedicure and gel manicure cost me $93 plus $10 tip with Winnie. Not my style. Will never go back. Horrible management. Good luck!"
3,"Really, really like this place from the food to the artwork and memorabilia.  We had the banana bread and pumpkin bread. So good and the butter took it over the top. Omelette was good.  The chicken fried steak was okay.  The service was pretty fast."
4,mmmmm chips with melted cheese!!!  so simple yet so good!!  I might be biased though because this was a post-drinking midnight snack...
2,"We came on a Monday night around 6:00, and there were maybe 5 others in line.  It's $10.99 and includes drinks (soda, milk, iced tea, etc.).  That deserved a 5 star.\n\nService was excellent.  She asked for our drink preference and came back many times to check on us.  That deserved another 5 star.\n\nUltimately, it does come down to the food.  I rate that a 2.  I started off w/the garden salad.  It was iceberg lettuce only and then I added toppings.  There were maybe a maximum of 10 toppings.  The bacon looked like it was made onsite (not from jar or bag), but it was overcooked.  My second plate was the \""American\"" food:  meatloaf (just okay with slightly overwhelming red pepper taste); mashed potato and corn (ordinary); and sausage, fish w/terragon sauce, vegetable lasagna (none tasted good).  Most of that plate was not eaten.  My next plate was kalua pork and chicken pancit (OK).  The best item was probably the fried chicken if you got the right pieces.  We had a couple of thighs that were juicy inside and golden crispy outside.\n\nDessert looked good tasted pretty good; too bad I was too full to really enjoy it.  I got a couple of slices of fruit, a piece of pound cake, and a strawberry tart.  There was soft serve ice cream, but I forgot to get it before I left.\n\nWhile I am looking for a less expensive buffet in Vegas, this one missed the mark."
3,"Line was huge on Sat night. I see why...very good variety of ice cream, cookies and cupcakes. I got  salted caramel brownie sundae yummy. First time at new the linq next to flamingos casino. Cool place to walk shop and eat."
1,"Ordered a 12\"" tuna sub.  The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side. 12\"" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.  Most expensive I have ever bought.  Never again at this location."
1,"The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \n\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \n\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \n\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \n\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \n\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\n\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \""eh\"" \n\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \n\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\n\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \n\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \""THE BEST\"" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \n\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \n\nFor the owner? You have your work cut out for you, I am not a professional in the food service industry but you should consider \""Restaurant Stakeout\"" if you find your patronage decline."
4,"I'm a avid coffee drinker and the coffee quality and taste is very important. My lady told me about this place called Noda and Smell Cat popped up. With a list of great reviews I had too try it out. Starbucks can only thrill a coffee lover so much till we need a new unique taste. This place has a amazing ambience and atmosphere. You'll notice private tables and their coffee roaster right in the middle of the store. I've tried two of their blends, Black Cat being my favorite. I took a bag of LLorana home which was a little darker. Very good roasted coffee. I highly recommend. Only problem, too far from my house."
0,"Horrible service... Ordered a drink that did not taste correct, sent it back and was still charge for the full price of the drink.  I was told there was nothing wrong on there and and I was still liable for the drink even though they dumped it in the sink.  I will never be back at this establishment and I wish them luck..."
3,"I think you need to consider the target audience for the Palms in order to truly appreciate it.  To give you an idea, let me explain my view of the archetypal Vegas casinos:\n  =  Bellagio is catering to the 50+ crowd with the classic styling and the reserved elegance\n  =  Venetian is great for those in their 40s looking for a lot of variety, or those with families\n  =  Wynn is luxurious yet modern, perfect for those in their 30s\n  =  Palms is all marketing hype and youthful abandon, designed to appeal to those in their 20s (or those who think they are still in their 20s)\n\nIf you agree with the above, then you'll agree that the Palms does a great job of filling a very important role in the Vegas casino cornucopia.\n\nThere are bright colors and lots of action.  It's fairly small (the casino is tiny compared to the mega-resorts), but the new Fantasy Tower almost doubles capacity while adding a new level of excitement.\n\nThe rooms in the Fantasy Tower are all brand new, and they've been designed with the metro crowd in mind - very modern, lots of dark woods (think W Hotel or THEhotel).  But the real reason to consider the Palms are the new clubs - Moon and the Playboy Club.\n\nThe new Playboy Club is an attempt to take away from the prime targets of THEhotel and the Wynn - young (but not too young) professionals.  The table games in the Playboy Club start at $50 a hand, so you aren't going to get your typical frat boy or sorority sister spilling their Bud Light on you.  The dealers are even more attractive than their profiles on the website, and it's a very dark room, giving it a distinct feel from normal casinos.  There's a $20 cover ($40 on weekends), so it's fairly steep if you don't have a host.  But the Playboy Club is connected to Moon, so you really get 2 clubs for the price of 1.\n\nPROS:\n- Great rooms for the price (the Palms is usually cheaper than hotels on the Strip)\n- It's on Flamingo Rd, so it's off the Strip and has extremely easy freeway access (perfect for the LA crowd or people with rentals)\n- Table games generally have lower limits - it's not unusual to find $10 tables even on weekends\n\nCONS:\n- It's not walkable to any other resort, so you need a car or time to take cabs\n- Although there isn't a conference center in the hotel, the Palms is often sold out - big games, holidays, etc.\n\nBEST OF DREW - Vegas-Style!\n- Best place to stay if price is no object: Four Seasons\n- Best place to stay for a bachelor party: Palms\n- Best place to stay for a bachelorette party: Venetian\n- Best pool area: Mandalay Bay\n- Best place for a couples getaway: THEhotel at Mandalay Bay"
4,"They do have vegetarian tacos, their potato taco is delicious!! And they also have vegetarian tamales, only on weekends! A must !!!"
0,"I'm glad this particular Denny's is closed. I remember going there about a year ago with my folks for lunch. we'd just gotten out of church and decided to eat out instead of rushing home for lunch. \n\nThe waitress that took our orders made fun of my Pennsylvania accent . Then she went away for twenty minutes.  She finally came back with our coffee and water. She took our food orders rather arrogantly and disappeared again for almost an hour. \n\nOur food arrived and were appalled  at its quality. The cheese burger I ordered was dripping with grease and oil, the fries were crunchy rather than crispy, My mother's soup was cold and watered down. My father's sausage and biscuits w/ gravy were a lumpy blob of goo.\n\nThe manager offered to comp us another meal but his attitude about it was condescending and arrogant. I know it's been years since my folks and I have been to a Denny's but if this is how all of them treat customers and their orders, I will never go to another one. And I havent been to one since."
2,This was my first visit to this theater.  It was located in the Palms Casino off W Flamingo Rd in Las Vegas.  The stadium seating was nice and the reclining seats were comfortable.  The $8 matinee was until 6pm.  My senior friends (over age 50) paid $4 today and a got a small popcorn and drink for $3.  And they have $5 tickets on Mondays.\nWe will be back.
0,"If you go here to by a car do this: \n1)by some water-based, non irritating lubricant \n2)research positions that are the most comfortable for when you're getting screwed\n3)if you're turned on by lying, swindling and games, these clowns are for you!\n\nFor starters,hopefully douchebag Johnny lemke is gone from this dealership. Had two back-to-back horrible business deals with this Chapman Autoplex and will not, I repeat, WILL NOT, ever be back. I got cornholed bigtime on my last Dodge in 2003. Me and a couple other co-workers bought from a sneaky and unscrupulous sales woman named Kim Chartier back in 98 or so and I should have learned back then not to come back to this dealership. All of us got screwed in so many ways that it will take me two hours to state what happened. Years later, we still joke about this dealership and how bad we got it. My friend Debbie L bought two or three used vehicles from Kim C and she almost needed therapy when she realized how bad she got screwed, and she could have saved alot of money buying from someone else.I turned in a leased car back to them in 2003 (dont ever lease-sales reps make more commission on leases) therefore I was talked into one when I could have bought the car for $10 more a month. Costly mistake.  And before my lease on my Dodge Neon ended and I still had another payment left, they talked me into ending my lease a month early so i can get sold another Dodge-well they were supposed to make my last lease payment for me and of course, they didn't, and I got stuck with two payments for one month. Also, my interest rate was almost a point higher than I was quoted over the phone-when I went to sign the Chrysler Financial papers, the sales manager was no where to be found, and someone else was left in charge of it. When I confronted the sales manager the next day,  he said I could have free car detailing for the entire time I owned the car!! What good is this when I am not coming back??  I should have walked when the interest rate was higher than he told me over the phone but but I needed a car, was in a bind,  and wanted this horrible experience over with. I was also sold a useless extended warranty that I could have negotiated down in price, but once again, the gal that sold me this made her money and thats all that matters.  After a couple more hiccups with the paperwork, and another issue with my turned in leased car, I called to complain to the head manager, Johnny Lemke- what a jerk, very rude to me, and basically said it wasnt his problem and if I didnt get anything in writing, they won't honor it.I will never buy a Dodge again, never buy an extended warranty-they are a scam and don't cover anything, and I will never deal with this dealership again.  After my experience with them and some issues with my turned in leased vehicle, I got to fight ANOTHER battle with Wells Fargo Auto Lease Finance-totally different story there but I won it, with no help  from the Chapman fu**tards. This dealership did nothing to guide me through turning in my leased vehicle either- I  think they should have recommended me do some stuff as I was buying another  vehicle from them. Nope. You need to do your research on turning in a leased vehicle and don't expect anyone at the dealership to save you any money or give you any useful advice. You need to ask the bank that you're leasing from, where their lot is and turn the vehicle in there. If you leave it at Chapman or another dealership, you will be charged a pick up fee. I ended up beating this and not paying but don't rely on the dealership to make this an easy transition. I hope the knuckleheads that were here back in 2003 are gone. And by the way, my junk Dodge Stratus was totaled when I got hit by a drunk driver- the POS was an even bigger POS and insurance paid it off and paid my GAP insurance so I got rid of the car and wasn't stuck with it any longer. Words of advice: do not lease, do not purchase extended warranties, do not do business with Chapman, and buy from private sellers people- it is cheaper and they are more honest. Run a carfax too."
1,"Overrated.\n\nIt's a good burger. Service and quality are great, but $30 for a [mediocre] burger, fries and a beer is ridiculous. Having a celebrity chef's name on this place doesn't mean that it's a great burger.  Add to the fact that he's known for his french and haute cuisine - means he shouldn't know that much about burgers.\n\nNot bad, but not worth the price.  Even for Vegas.\n\nI'll be running to the In-N-Out about a mile away instead."
2,Chicken fried rice was amazing. I tried the ribs for the first time and was not very excited. I prefer korean bbq. But the shrimp dish and chicken friend rice was on point. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the location was not the best and weird people stood around the car and I had to manuver to get around them.
4,"First tip-Parking lot in the back through an alley. Easier than the front. \nMy friend and I came here to check it out and overall, we loved it. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got one on one personal treatment with the chef so we learned a lot. \nNot to sound like a broken record but the ceviche is soooo good. I love the flavors. The ceviche is just the fish marinated and the ceviche mixto is fish, squid, mussels, and clams.  I think the ceviche of just fish is the better of the two. It just holds the flavor better.  And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy.  So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix.  I can only imagine how spicy hot is.  Been here three times and I still crave it. \nOk, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been.\nThe causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food. \nIf you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes. \nGood lomo saltado according to bf. I do like that the fries are crispy and skinny. \nThe kicker is that if you go now, they finally have air conditioning!!!  It was getting to be a bit difficult going during the summer so I can only imagine how the workers felt. \nWarning though, if you are from California and used to Peruvian food there, they don't carry the green aji sauce that we know and love.  Apparently that's only a CA creation since we're so used to jalape\u00f1os.\nThis is a must place. From the wait staff to the food, everything is too notch."
2,Surprisingly good! Was expecting the typical greasy breakfast platter but they have a variety of selection from healthy egg whites to thick rich gravy. We tried the bisquit w gravy which was pretty tasty. Bacon was ok... Nothing to rave about. Otherwise everything we ordered was good and at the right price. They even leave you a pitcher of water and coffee so you don't have to keep asking the waitress for refills. No wait for seating even on a Sunday for brunch.
1,This is consistently the most unorganized Einsteins we go to. We try to avoid this location but when we find ourselves here our hopes are that they've improved. Year after year we've found they they stay consistent: unorganized and confused.
0,"I went on Saturday and they obviously were only letting in White people. All shapes and sizes. Some pretty and some NOT so pretty. The only thing they all had in common was being White. Out of 7 people (3 girls/4boys) only 2 of our group was White. The only way they were letting our mixed race group in is if we paid a ridiculous amount of money. It wasnt even just purchase a bottle. It was large bar tabs for EACH guy, plus entrance fee for EACH guy AND a special $20 tip from EACH guy to enter this so called amazing club. This bar is racist. Spend your money somewhere else."
3,"The only negative thing here was that we had a reservation for 10 but didn't get sat till 10:30. But it was the opening weekend so I guess that can be expected.\n\nAs a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey, got to say this place didn't disappoint at all! The lobster app was so delish! The bone in rib eye was also crazy good! The mac n cheese is also crazy good!\n\nWhile Gordon wasn't there while I was having dinner, Chef Andy (female) from the show Hell's Kitchen was there. She was a sweetheart and came over to the table to check in and take a picture.\n\nWill be back for sure!"
4,"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch in town.  The Carne Adovada is perfection, and therefore I get it every damned time.  Tender, spiced, sauced porkwads with eggs and I believe breakfast taters on the side.  The spicy bloody is perfection.  I faintly recall the Jalapeno Eggs Benedict being yummy--whoever ordered it shared sparingly and guarded it with their life.\n\nThe joint is dimly lit, so you don't need to wear shades to nurse your hangover.  You sit in cushioned, isolated little adobe booths tucked away in corners--feels intimate to me and never loud.    The staff's always been really friendly.\n\nTen visits and going strong.  I'd be there right now actually if I'd run the prerequisite ten miles this week. :("
3,"I have a ball every time I go to Ak-Chin Pavilion but I think the level of enjoyment one experiences often depends on the state of mind. Doesn't hurt to remember that you're in the same place as thousands of other people and your experience is not dependent on them, but rather on YOU.\n\nAk-Chin is an outdoor amphitheater in the middle of BFE where everyone drives, parks for free, attends a great concert, then tries to leave at the same time and get upset about it. My friends and I try to be somewhat responsible and book a nearby hotel and use a taxi service to get to the concert. When the concert is over, just walk to the QuikTrip on the corner right outside of Ak-Chin and catch a cab back to the hotel. It saves us the headache of trying to navigate our way out of the lot which can take a good hour. \n\nAk Chin puts on a great show with fantastic sound and great projection screens. We  paid for actual seats in a section for Blake Shelton but quickly realized the better way to go is with lawn seats. Lawn seats were my first choice but someone in my party wanted to be closer. When I'm at a concert, I'm pretty much dancing and singing as are all the people on the lawn. Not everyone in my section felt the music in the same fashion and stayed seated for most of the show so my girls and I got a few looks but truth be told, I paid the same amount of money as they did and if I want to show my enthusiasm by standing and dancing, I'm gonna do it. But from now on, I'll stick with the lawn. It's a better crowd anyway.\n\nDrink prices are no more than any other concert venue and there are plenty of choices, even a tequila bar. Better food would be nice though. A hard pretzel for $3.50 and cheese sauce for an additional $4 is a little steep. I'd pay quite a bit more to have a decent meal from a local restaurant down in the food and drink area. \n\nMisters cool the crowd down in the food and drink area which is very welcome because it gets HOT jamming out in the middle of summer!"
2,"I rented with McQuarters about a year ago in Greenfield and had a mostly pleasant experience.  Management and maintenance were always very friendly and the apartment and building were well maintained.  Rents are pretty expensive for the area, but I did feel that I got what I paid for.  \n\nMy one major complaint is that, near the end of my lease, brokers repeatedly entered my apartment with potential future tenants without warning.  Fortunately I was there twice when they arrived, but I can't help assuming that this happened many other times.  They eventually fixed this problem and began calling ahead of time, but it left a very unpleasant taste in my mouth."
2,"We loved almost everything about the Wynn.\n\nThe rooms, the baths, the room technology, the service, the beds, the restaurants (pricey but good), the decor (amazing!!!!), the casino, the stores (! the stores! Penhaligon at Apothecary...I hadn't found it in the US and always have to order online). Beautiful place and we got put on the 60th floor with a stunning view.\n\nHowEVER. Our stay was seriously marred by a bunch of really young kids in the hot tub at the pool. We mentioned something to the lifeguard, who followed us to the hot tub, looked at the large group of 7-10 year olds in the hot tub, and walked away. About a minute after she \""took care of the situation\""?  One of the kids started doing snot shots in the hot tub. \n\nYes, really, a 10 year old doing snot shots in the hot tub at the Wynn. It would have been funny if we hadn't been IN THE TUB at the time."
0,"RIP-OFF ALERT!!!!! Went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $18, faded out t-shirts for $2, AND THEN... went to pay for 5 magazines. A sign by the books clearly states: \""Magazines 29 cents\"", only @ the checkout they were marked on the back 99 cents!!! Talked to manager who just said that's their system. Won't be going back. Honesty is NOT company policy."
4,Nice church!
1,"The price is not bad, but I would have expected better for it. The meat was bland, with only the short ribs and pork being decent. The side dishes didn't make sense, they were very \""Americanized\"", and I don't understand why you have to pay extra money for lettuce. The price isn't that much extra, but it's the concept. Isn't meat more expensive than lettuce? Why is that unlimited..."
4,"The customer service and professionalism of The body waxing studio is great! I heard about them through yelp and decided to give them I try. Ashley was great handling my first Brazilian and it was not uncomfortable or weird in any way. She also did her best to keep the pain at a minimum. The amazing service they provide is what made me give a 5 star rating. \n\nAs far as the actual results of the wax, I'm not very impressed. It was my first wax ever so I understand that there will be patches left over but not one part of me is smooth. I have a few sections that are visible patches and the rest is stubble. It feels like it would about 5 days after I shave. Not smooth you can feel fuzz everywhere. That is definitely not what I expected. There is no possible way I could keep this for 4-6 weeks! I'm ready to shave right now! I'm not sure if this is normal but if so I don't think I'll ever get it done again. \n\nRegardless the staff is wonderful and I'll definitely return to get my eyebrows done."
2,"I was here today for lunch. Our waitress was brand new and so we had to be a little patient, but she was very friendly and will catch on quickly. That said, I have no complaints about the service, but the food was not anything to write home about. I've eaten here a few times in the past, and I recommend going with one of their top sellers (noted on the menu) - they seem to be top sellers for a reason. Deviating from those doesn't pay off. But they do have outdoor seating, and it is a great place for people watching!"
4,"This place is great!  As someone mentioned, its a refurbished Wendy's.  It brings an old school feel to it, they have done great work on the interior.  You can use the drive thru window to pick up to-go orders.  Awesome.\n\nEvery time I have ordered here the food has been fantastic.  I always find myself going back to the Pad Thai!   The best thai in the area and quite possibly the best thai I have had in Phoenix.  Also a locally owned restaurant, support this place!"
1,"I was so excited to see that this restaurant re-opened... Unfortunately that was short lived :-(  Took our family of 5 there tonight for dinner. Service was very poor, I think we actually offended our waitress by asking for drink refills! Food was was too salty and we all left with stomach aches. The salsa's were good... But they charged 1.89 for about 2 tbsp of mango salsa :-O.  After they nickel and dimed us we left disappointed .. And will not return"
0,"i wanted to catch some sun so i went downstairs with my friend to check out the pools.. walk past a couple pools to the other side and there's a short line already.. guestlist even for aria hotel guests? we got there about 11 and the line took forever.. there were only about 10 people ahead of us too.. daybeds were going to $100 when we first fell in line.. i went to the bathroom and when i got back they raised the price to $150.. if there was a good dj i knew spinning then we would've put down the money for one.. good thing we didn't bc when we got inside about 30min later, the pool lounge was empty! why? bc everyone that was in line ahead of us left soon after entering.. the pool was tiny and dj was just ok.. the only thing good about this place was that there was free champagne for ladies from 11-1.. i def took advantage of this and passed mine along to my friend before waiting a few min for refills..after a few trips to the bar i got another glass of champ and we were allowed to pour it into a plastic cup (classy, i know) before leaving the lounge.. total time spent at liquid- no more than 30 min.. we just went to the reg aria pools and that was good enough for me..i made a few trips back for the free champagne and didn't have to wait in line bc i still had my stamp..\n\ni would only come back if i was staying at aria, the free champagne, and if a dj i knew was going to be there.."
2,They have an amazing sound system thats so loud you can feel it.
0,Don't walk by.  Run by this place and don't look back.  The worst Mexican food in Phoenix.  Absolutely no flavor. The only thing going for it is the friendly wait staff.
1,"Not all that good, unless you're drunk and cutting the rug, I guess.\n\nMy wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and it was a decent-sized crowd enjoying the nice weather. I perked up when the server told me it was happy hour. However, this is the lamest happy hour I've ever seen or heard of. $3 domestic bottles? What kind of happy hour is that? Who is charging more than $3 for a bottle of Bud Light even at the worst of times? And of course, I go through the normal shenanigans with the server as I ask for other bottles that are made in the US but somehow aren't included in the special. Fat Tire, etc. These are domestic, but no, you can't have them for $3.\n\nI order the carne asade tacos: $10, no rice or beans. No chips on the table. The meat is very sparse, and the rest of the taco is mushy stewed tomato. The tortillas are mushy as well, and there is a sad sprinkling of lettuce in the middle of the plate that would barely be sufficient for one taco, let alone the three that are on the plate. I took 2 bites and sent it back. My wife had a chimichanga which was OK. And by OK, I mean it's on par with what you might buy in the freezer at Safeway.\n\nOn the plus side, the server was really nice. So, yeah."
0,"I have out-of-town guests coming this weekend so I scheduled Kleen Geeks a month in advance.  I even reminded them of the appointment last week.  They assured me they would be there.  When no one showed up, I started calling: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours past their appointment time.  Not only did they not show up, but no one answered the phone or returned their voicemails.  I am really, really disappointed."
1,Sold me drinks before close and rushed me out. Don't sell me drinks if you are going to be rude and rush me out of your bar
0,"Three of us stopped for breakfast. I had raisin bread french toast scrambled eggs and bacon. I love scrambled eggs. I left the majority of them on the plate. Why? They tasted wet and had no flavor. Made me think were scooped out of a warming tray in the kitchen. I did ask and she said the eggs are \""whipped\"". She did go on to tell me that I could \""order your scrambled eggs anyway you want them.\"" That is a first. Two small pieces of bacon that were burnt. French toast was good with the cinnamon butter. I looked at the ranch potatoes on my father-in-law's plate and they looked like they were scooped right out of a steamer.\n\nGood food should have a nice smell to it when it is delivered. This did not. Over priced, slow service, food that tasted the furthest thing from fresh-made. Save your money and do not even stop. Drive on by as anything will be better than this restaurant."
2,"In summary, the Biltmore Stingray is a posh bar that serves OK Japanese food.  If you're going to get anything here, I'd stick with the rolls as that's what they do best.  The sashimi/chirashi is not the freshest and was even a tad slimy.  That having been said, I'm a huge critic of sashimi and use its quality in judging Japanese restaurants, so I may be bringing down the hammer a lot more heavily than others would.  But, I give credit where credit's due: they make great drinks, the service is always prompt and pleasant, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is extremely comfortable."
1,"They have a lot of things you need but let me tell you why my review is so low. I'm a college student, I was up late one night studying and then I went over for some snacks and an energy drink. So they made me wait for ten minutes because of the computers or something like that. There was about 8 other people behind me waiting during those ten minutes and then finally a lady came over so we could get the line moving. She took her sweet time AND she answered her cell phone during the check out! I was so angry because it was rude when we were all wanting to leave. It wasn't an emergency call just a \""hey how ya doin\"" call! I must say I have never wanted to not go back to a store as bad as this. They got two stars because they have good food."
0,"We stopped by here prior to going to a Cirque show on our first night in Vegas.  I made reservations for 5 so I expected to have a table ready at that time.  Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...\n\nWe were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \""Spago\"" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  \n\nNow, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? \n\nI wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either. This is just not worth your time OR MONEY...there are better restaurants out there for competitive prices.  Nothing to see at this establishment but they are clearly enjoying the benefit of being inside the Forum Shops.  Don't say you weren't warned..."
3,"Ate here twice on a 3 day visit. \nExcellent, charbroiled burger. I had the Tex-Mex, twice. Perfect both times. Pricey? I disagree, though I live in a resort town. Money and time well spent. Service was great and they seemed to enjoy what they were doing. And clean.\nYou won't regret it except if your a vegan.........."
2,"Went there for dinner recently with family. Found the place easily but we thought we had the wrong place initially. From the outside, the place was nothing special. If there weren't some tables or chairs on the sidewalk in front of it, I don't think we would have found the right place or door to enter. From outside it looks like a smoke shop or a convenience store. There are posters and all kinds of stuff on the windows, not something you would expect at a classier place or restaurant. Inside we were pleasantly surprised however. Place was nice and cozy and nice music. It was overall a nice atmosphere...more lounge like than restaurant like. I think they'll get a lot more business if the make the outside look presentable too. If I was just driving by and wanted to eat, I would have never stopped there bc from outside it looks like a 1 star place. Anyway, we sat to eat. We had a toddler with us but they have no high-chairs for kids. Please get some. There were others with little kids and babies and NO baby seats so parent had to hold all the kids. Good thing ours was old enough to sit in chair without falling. \n\nService was great and fast. Waiters were nice and professional. Place was very clean. Our orders were taken quickly and the food started coming out fast. One thing we did not like was that some of us got our meals before we even got our drinks or salads or appetizers. Who does that? Waitress told us that she has to bring us the food as the chef makea it, but c'mon. But why would the chef make our main course before our salad and appetizers. I was already full before my appetizer, soup and salad came out. My family waited to get soup and salad before touching their meals, but by that time their main course meal was already cold. Food was ok. Nothing to write home about. It wasn't bad by any means but the fries were overcooked and hard and crispy and all the meats were very very dry. No juice on the meat at all. My wife and mother had the chicken soup. I didn't try but they said it was so bland that they each started adding whatever salt and spices we had on the table to give it flavor. My toddler loves soup but she didn't even want that one. It wasn't bad people, just  could be better...juicier, more flavor and served IN ORDER....... Drinks, appetizers, soup/salad, main course, dessert, etc. Overall we had a good experience. Place and staff are good. I would go again eventually. I do recommend you try for yourself and I hope owners take some pointers from this review."
0,"For such a nice hotel you would think there customer service would be up to par. Upon check in the staff was suppose to have in room surprise amenities awaiting my wife which they were not.(set up a week in advance) There form of an apology was a \""room upgrade\""... Same room just a few floors higher. The T.V did not work and neither did the in room movie service. There excuse was there are thousands of rooms and they can not keep them all working all the time. Nothing was offered for that. At adult pool apparently all the front row chairs are reserved for cabanas. Which is fine but make sure they are marked. We had a cabana waitress come over and yell at my wife to move because we did not have a cabana. Not even a please just yelled at her to move. The chairs she was sitting in were not marked in any way. All they had to eat at the pool was pre packaged sandwiches and when you are allergic to certain things it makes it pointless. I was so taken back on this trip. Upon checkout and speaking to multiple people no one even cared. They got our money and they were done with us. It was our first Time staying there and we will not be going back. Should have stuck with the Bellagio which we are use to and will stay there from now on!! They had me fill out a comment card... Like I will ever hear anything back on that one what a joke."
0,"With all the hype about The Palms Hotel, I was utterly disappointed!  First, the rooms look like motel rooms.  Just a small box with no pizazz.  The sink in the bathroom didn't drain and the handle on the shower broke off.  There was no magnified mirror in the bathroom.  The TV was a small 32\"" tube.  The worse part was the top of the Armoir/TV stand; it was so dusty and dirty and had trash on it that God knows how long its been there.\n\nI will never stay at the Palms again.  I did have friends who stayed at Palms Place that had much nicer rooms/suites.  But after this experience I won't be staying at Palms or Palms Place in the future.\n\nI'll be staying at Aria next time!!!!\n."
3,"My goodness, I've basically grown-up (Club-wise) with Tao. I've probably been 10 or so times and I still believe it is one of the better clubs out there. BUT, it is not as amazing as it once was. \n\nNow, they close off the top-level on busy nights and that causes the other two levels to get ridiculously over-crowded (and alot of the crowdedness is just due to Tao's ever-increasing popularity). But, the decor at this place is the best i've seen and the girls are always ready to let-loose and have a good time (typically not the stuck up crowd). It also has a great mix of ethnicitiies...it has everything you could ever want in a club!\n\nAnd the best part of all is this guy Taoboda! He can get your entire group past the line and in for free before 11 AND all the girls get free drinks from 10-11. What an awesome hook-up!\n\nTaoboda alone keeps this place at a 4-star club for me despite its recent downfalls in other areas."
2,"Parking lot is a bit small but your typical goodwill. I love going on Thursdays, $1 days! They pick a certain tag color and no matter what the item is (Besides food, new and seasonal) it is only a buck! Some items can be a bit over priced, but if you go on a sale day you can scoop up a great deal on a donated treasure =)"
0,This place is a dump. Very dirty and grimy. The tables and seats are not clean. The waffles were ok. Nothing special. I would not go here again.
0,"I had a reservation in which my insurance company was paying for. I talked to \""John\"" on the phone and had everything set up and asked ahead of time if I could pay cash and I was told it was not a problem. I take a Taxi to their location (was in an accident) and \""John\"" was the one I talked to and became the most difficult person to deal with that I've ever talked to. Wouldn't take cash and wouldn't allow me to use a card that was in someone else's name. They also wouldn't pick us up from 2 miles away because they were apparently too busy.. but when we got there they were anything but busy. I understand companies have policies but give me a break! He literally lied to our face and was a complete dick doing so."
2,"It appeared very obvious that Red Velvet Cafe would win me over, upon the moment we arrived- due to their lovely decor, likely furnished by IKEA. The modern bar stools & high tops were aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, not very practical when dining in such a confined area. I couldn't really get comfortable while eating, which was a turn off, at first.\n\nTo start out, we ordered \""Chicken/ Vegan Nuggets\"". When I read this on the menu, I thought \""Oh cool, you have an option to get either chicken or vegan style\"". Apparently, I was very wrong. Our vegan nuggets were average, definitely not chicken, but not horrific either. I really enjoyed the tangy red sauce that they were served beside. I'm still kicking myself for not asking what it was- I wanna go with...something vinegar based?!\n\nFor our main course, my boyfriend & I shared the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. I wasn't really sold on this when we ordered it. Not because I'm shy about spicy things, but because its described as \"" Lettuce, Tomato, Buffalo Sauce, Ranch and Cheese\"" (I mean really, how exciting can you be, Buffalo Chicken Wrap?). Despite its very bland description, there are so many complements it deserves! First of all, you know when you're eating a wrap & its hard to take bites without pieces of lettuce, meat, or other veggies escaping because they are too long? How about chopped lettuce (no yucky iceberg pieces) mixed with cheese, lightly covered in ranch & cubed grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce- all cozy in a wheat wrap. Very easy to eat, without excess food particles falling out! I also loved the fact that it was served with baked chips. I give this wrap 4 stars!\n\nLets get down to my favorite part of every meal...DESSERT! So, you can't go to the Red Velvet Cafe without ordering Red Velvet Cake. No regrets there, at all. Although I was very shocked when I found out that the entire piece of cake that I consumed was only 150 calories (not that I'm couting) AND completely vegan!!! It tasted like a heart attack, although its significantly less volatile than that Little Debbie Snack Trash your mom put in your lunch box. Without a doubt, the best red velvet that I've ever experienced. The frosting was heavenly, the cake was rich, & the strawberry on top- refreshing.\n\nWill I return to Red Velvet Cafe? YES, can't wait!"
2,"Great staff but food unfortunately was lacking. Perhaps it just so happened that I ordered the \""wrong\"" dish (a rather mediocre Farfalle Alfredo) but I never enjoyed their butternut squash ravioli in the past either so...\nI will give them props for dessert though. The lemon tower cake was luscious and served with the freshest strawberries."
3,"Love, Love, Love Sierra Bonita Grill. Very unassuming restaurant at the Southeast Corner of 7th Street and Glendale Avenue. The food is incredible, with many dishes leaning towards the Southwestern and Mexican influences that are prevalent here in the Phoenix Metro Area. I personally can't live with out the Carne Asada Dinner. The skirt steak is seasoned and cooked to perfection, the traditional beans and rice are wonderful supports, and the fresh tortillas and guacamole make the dish a masterpiece. For appetizers, the spinach and oxaca cheese quesadilla is great, the hand-hacked guacamole and salsa that comes with fresh warm chips is a can't miss, and the margaritas are perfect. Sierra Bonita is owned by the same proprietor as Phoenix City Grill, and is a excellent complement to the Valley scene and the the 7th Street corridor."
0,When I came to Vegas this place got so much talk but really these were the worst tacos I've ever had in my life the meat was so gross I couldn't even eat them! Not to mention the horrible service! definitely NEVER coming back!!!
2,"The food was decent, had better lobster stuff elsewhere for the same price honestly.\n\nHad the Lobster and Chips... They should consider using actual English type chips (steak fries) instead of french fries.  Also had the lobster mac n cheese; kind of bland honestly.  They gave me a free tasting of the lobster ice cream and that was interesting, but probably would never order a full scoop.\n\nAll in all it's decent food, but for the same amount of money I rather eat elsewhere..."
0,went here last week and the server was very rude and when I talked to her about it she acted like she didn't care.   I guess I can spend my money other places.
4,"F&F is not a restaurant; it's a way of life.\n\nI went to college in Pittsburgh, and there is NOTHING like F&F's half price Late Night experience. F&F is not the only place that does the half price Late Night thing, but it may as well be, for me.\n\nAfter 11 pm every night, most of the menu is half price. You do have to get there early (10:30 ish on Fri/Sat/Sun) to put your name on the list, but for students, standing outside and chatting with your friends is part of the experience.\n\n(Edited to add: Don't forget to tip on what your full bill would have been!)\n\nMy faves include the sweet potato fries, baked brie (!!!), Smashed Potato pizza, and turkey or buffalo burgers. I've heard they have amazing beers (but I don't drink) and I know they've got some fantastic desserts (my fave was the bread pudding which is gone now, but the brownie and apple turnover dishes are delish too).\n\nThey also have a surprisingly good brunch, and for the record, the basement is much less loud than the upstairs.\n\nEvery time I go back to Pittsburgh, I make sure F&F is on the agenda. Like I said, it's not just a restaurant."
4,"I joined SAR in July 2009; and only used the weights and some of the cardio equipment. In November I started taking their kickboxing classes, which were awesome!\n\nNow I'm hooked! Their Spin, Rowing, and Boxing Cardio classes are TOUGH but worth it. Such a great value, the instructors are great, and at only $75 a year (for residents) it's great!"
0,"Forget this place, we came in at 2:45pm. They state that their restaurant closed at 3pm, but they kicked us out for no reason. No respect and they give no customer value. Change your damn closing time if you won't even work up to it. Pathetic. Thank god we didn't even go there. Their sushi sucks. Worst sushi in Vegas honestly."
1,"Decent food, elaborately plated. Perhaps too elaborate. \n\nIt's nice to see a casino-based restaurant with windows, but the view is forgettable. Unless you like watching the valet park cars.\n\nService was very friendly, but excruciating slow."
1,Went Way downhill in last few yrs I guess.  Crappy server...mediocre food and beverages for too much money.   Too bad...we need more decent restaurants on the west side
3,"*3.5 Stars*\n\nThis street that Mikado is located is hip, jiving, and what a great atmosphere! I loved how most restaurants made use of the sidewalk and put mini patios, but without making the space cramped. \n\nMy bf mentioned that this used to be a Vietnamese restaurant, but the same owners decided to turn it into Japanese (?). Even though we arrived pretty late, the place was still packed. After we sat down, there were more people coming in. Because we weren't that hungry, my bf and I decided to order a couple of things to share: Agedeshu Tofu, Cod, and several rolls. Over all, the food was good.\n\nI loved the service. It was personable, and efficient, yet unhurried. A gentleman (part owner perhaps?) was patient in describing what their most popular dishes were.\n\nThis is my first Japanese restaurant I tried in Montreal (and I am sure there are a lottttt more), but I wouldn't mind coming back here. It's in a great part of town and the food and service is great."
3,"Went here for 2 days with a groupon.  The hotel is very easy to find, just off the freeway.  It  is very clean, modern looking.  We had a 2 queen room.  It was very clean, the bedding was so soft and the beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was very clean, new fixtures great water pressure.  The pool was a lot of fun.  They have an indian restaurant there but we did not go there.  The breakfast was the only sour note.  Only eggs, toast juice and coffee.  Anyway, I would definitely stay here again.  It used to be a Ramada, but recently remodeled.  I loved that it was very modern looking and so clean.  The front desk personnel were very pleasant."
0,really sad.  really small.  I am used to farmers markets in other cities.  I try not to compare but cant help it when it takes a whole 5 minutes to navigate the whole market.  an awful lot of non local products at way to high a price.  I did run into a local resident I met when I moved to phoenix 1 1/2 months ago and turns out it was his first time here.  also his last he said.  I am also an animal lover and a crowded market is no place for dogs and non supervised children.  the lawyers would have a great time with it.  save your hard earned money and go to sprouts.
1,"Food ok, but not for the price, dinner for two with 2 watery sangrias was $60! Service was incredibly slow, although it was busy for a Tuesday nite. The staff were running around, didn't look like they knew what they were doing. They should have this figured out by now."
1,"awful.  and this coming from someone who gives every place pretty much a four or five star review.  pizza was ok.  employees were nice enough.  but the parents who go here use it as free day care.  kids were running around everywhere, beating up on each other.  my kids, who are no angels, but know how to behave, were horrified.  parents came up to us afterwards and said \""sorry\"" - uhhhhh, too late, you think?  the owners need to screen parents and their kids before allowing them to come here.  this was not a mellow experience.  i still have nightmares."
4,"Food is amazing always! Never frozen anything, so everything is fresh!!! Great deals, great food, and great people! Yes sometimes they forgot a few things, but were very fast in rectifying the situation! I have eaten here since they have opened, and I will keep eating their delicious food!!! Love this place!!!"
1,"Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!\nI wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!\n\nA sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.\n\nWe finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.\n\nThe server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.\n\nOverall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer."
2,"It lacks identity. Is it a mediocre Japanese restaurant? Or contempory american? It was well cooked, but it wasn't inspired. For example: my main course was Japanese grilled skirt steak with Shishito peppers. My side was truffle Mac and cheese. Did not pair well at all. . . beautiful place, But just \""Okay\"" food."
2,"Just your standard diner.  Nothing special, but good food, salad bar, good size portions.  If your not looking for anything fancy, but just want to get something to eat it's the place to go.  Meatloaf dinner with mash potatoes and green beans, with soup or salad was $8.95.  Was hot tasty, maybe too much gravy."
4,"Excellent little cafe with, as another reviewer put it, a \""continental feel\"". Nice array of sandwiches, platters and cakes on offer. Nice breakfasts and very decent coffee. Cosy inside with a quirky but comfortable d\u00e9cor and very friendly service. I've been twice and each time, I had one of their generous baguettes, filled with hummus or feta and olives. A tasty side vegetable salad featuring beets and a simple dressing came with it. The baguettes are  delish and good value for money. This was no skimpy sandwich. Give it a try."
1,"My friends and I had a poor first experience at Rx Boiler Room last night. We arrived around 10:15pm looking for dinner. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a couple of bar patrons, 2 or 3 four tops and a party of 12 (or so) in the back. \n\nWe were a party of 7, and it took the hostess a few minutes to figure out where to seat us.  The table selected needed to he cleaned so we waited a few minutes for that to happen. This was the first of several red flags for the night as it was over 5 minutes for the staff to clean and set the table \n\nAfter seating we ordered a round of drinks, water and some appetizers. The drinks arrived in 10 minutes, apps arrived in 15 minutes, and the waiter came around to get out dinner drink order. \n\nWe had to ask for appetizer plates. Twice. Eventually they arrived. \n\nAnother 10 minutes elapsed while the waiter informed a member if our party that her light beer wasn't available. Strange that they have Miller Lite and Bud Light but no Coors Light? Anyway, drink order was still incomplete as I was asked three times about which beer I had ordered (Innis and Gunn, off the menu). \n\nThe food was decent. Not outstanding for the price, but acceptable. \n\nApproaching 45 minutes since our arrival, still no 2nd round and we hadn't ordered dinner. We made the decision to leave and a member of our party approached the manager.\n\nThe manager apologized (ok) and then proceeded to claim no knowledge of a problem (hmm), blame us for not saying something sooner (not ok), and then had the temerity to ask us to give his restaurant another try. FAIL. \n\nSorry, mate. The manager should know what's going on. When he sees apps on the table, menus still on the table, no app plates, no drinks and it's been a while... He should stop by and ask if we are ok.  Instead he didn't engage, and as a result he lost is as customers. \nAnd I'm sharing our poor experience with other Yelpers in hopes that you won't suffer as we did. \n\nEpilogue: We walked to another restaurant in Mandalay Place, arriving a few minutes after 11. Within minutes we were seated, our drink order was promptly filled and food was quickly served. We finished, happily full, at 11:45.  Rx Boiler Room, take that as a lesson on how to serve customers."
1,"This buffet was better the first time we ate there.  This second time around after a few years was not that good.  The best thing I liked to eat there was the Wonton noodle soup, and their Kona Coffee ice cream."
4,Love it! Everytime I go in I want one of everything! Feathers and lace and satin everywhere! Definitely make sure to look everywhere or you may miss something!
3,"This is the first time we stayed @ the Nugget previous night we were at the The Plaza big difference, this place was more alive.. glad I didn't have to pay the resort fee, wasnt able to get a coupon book because I used my AAA 10% discount.. wish I had a choice to see which would of been more beneficial to us.. we had a great time in this place alot to do but only had one day, so until next time..."
4,"I am currently trying to find a new gym home. I'm not into the lvac type gyms. I prefer specialty gym because they are tough work outs. I visited camp fit force during the \""share the love\""(free classes were offered all week). I attended a Tuesday and Thursday class. Those happened to be the wod workouts. I do have experience with crossfit,  circuit training, and boxing.\nOmar is the greatest.  He has a great personality and really knows what he's talking about. The gym is very welcoming. I have one more gym to try out before I make a decision, but I'm thinking that the decision has been made.  Fit force, you know WHOOT!!!!!"
4,"The food was great and the service was exceptional! I'm not a big fast food girl but this place was healthy, tasty and super fast! I'm vegetarian and my boyfriend is a true carnivore and we both loved the food! The restaurant space was super comfortable and VERY clean! We'll be back!"
2,"I always hear rave reviews about the chili at Lupie's, but I just wasn't all that impressed. (By comparison, I went to the annual Plaza Midwood/Chantilly Chili Cookoff and found WAY BETTER chili of all varieties.) Still, Lupie's is one of those landmark restaurants in Charlotte - and one of few that's still standing - so I want to support it. I'd recommend checking it out. It's a little off the beaten path and it's a fun down-home kind of place."
4,"I love stationary. I love this shop.\n\nIt's amazing how many stationary shops there are in the city, and I think I love them all....but Scribbler is definitely in my top 3. It's full of beautiful people and beautiful things. They have great office sets - matching folders, pens, staplers and punchs. What's more, they have masculine sets too! So if pink floral patterns aren't your thing lads, they have really nice mens things too!\n\nI'm like Sam C, I've found myself giggeling at the cards too. They're brilliant! If I need a card or wrapping paper for someone special I'll come to a shop like Scribbler - what's not to love?!"
2,If you want PHO in Pittsburgh (Considering the Vietnamese Restaurant selections) I would choose this Place over Tram's Kitchen. The Pho here is more fragrant.
4,"The truffle corn!  This is my personal steakhouse, though there are many to choose from in Vegas.  You can also get genuine (non-poser) Kobe steak for $42 an ounce (last I remember).  I haven't had a bad experience here yet."
1,Flying Delta out of Phoenix today.  The desk clerk might have been the most annoying person I've come across all month.  Literally every 4 minutes he got on the overhead with an annoying anecdote about how people need to check their carry on bags. Just make people check them if the plane is full. I don't need to hear about how Santa wants me to be on the nice list. Just get these people on the damn plane.  Boarding has been going on for 30 min on this not very busy airplane!   Ugh!
4,"I used to love this place when I lived in AZ....the brats were amazing and even the burgers and curly fries were good.  Not too healthy, but then again, you don't think about that kind of stuff when you go to a hot dog restaurant."
3,"Excellent service, atmosphere, and food.  Started at the bar and had an excellent whiskey sour.  Made with an egg white and topped with bitters it was excellent.  We had the tasting menu.  One vegetarian and one non vegetarian.  Each course was tasty with excellent presentation.  Plenty of food but not so much that we left stuffed.  The wait staff knew the menu well including ingredients and preparation.  We will be back for sure!"
1,I ordered delivery a few months ago. Their sandwich and fries were good but the pizza was COMPLETELY BURNT TO THE PINT WHERE IT WAS INEDIBLE.
3,"I browse the app from time to time to see if there is anything new in my area (though doubt it) and get excited when something different pops up that proves me wrong. I see a Thai place and am intrigued and became even more excited seeing two people I trust (Dan and Amanda) reviewed it. Hopped into the car to try something new than the same ole' take out and fast food open late night. \n\nThis Thai food kitchen is integrated as part of Bailey's Bar which definitely is odd and not what you would expect. You sit at this typical divey bar except the menu has Thai. If you sit at the bar they have a bar menu of sorts with things like burgers mixed with the Thai, but ask for a full Thai menu. On the night we were there (Friday), it was bumping with karaoke which added more to the odd placement. The fact that the original owner of Komol is running this place make it even more bizarre, but a promise of some good food.\n\nWe both got Thai ice teas and at $1.25 this is the cheapest I've seen this drink being sold and it was good and not too sweet.\n\nPad Kee Mao with Pork - I think this was pretty good, decent flavor and perfect amount of spice. The pork was good quality and tender. \n\nTofu Panang - this is a far more fragrant panang than most places do, definitely like Komols. If you love keffir leaf/ lemongrass type flavor then you might highly enjoy its presence here. The serving was generous and the tofu was lightly fried on the outside but nice and silky inside. Definitely ate this up.\n\nServing sizes were more than generous as well for the price, we had some leftovers. It was $21ish for our meal for 2 drinks, 2 entrees, 1 extra rice. They do lunch specials until 3pm Mon- Fri as well, so you can get some noms on the cheap here. \n\nThe server was very friendly and attentive. Considering we were on the other side of the bar in a booth, I was apprehensive if we would be seen, but she anticipated our needs and made rounds to check on us. \n\nEating in a smokey bar not your thing? Take it to-go and they also do delivery! \n\nDefinitely a great addition to the NW as we don't have a Thai place abundance here, but excited it seems to be authentic and quality Thai at that. I think we will end up getting a lot of take out from here since it's on the way home. Highly pleased with my inaugural visit with the quality of food and can't wait to try the rest of the menu."
3,"While walking around the strip for a place to grab some breakfast, we found this place and couldn't resist steak and eggs for a mere $6.\n\nWe all ordered the same thing, except I got myself a good ol' Mimosa, and when the Steak & Eggs arrived I was happy. It wasn't crazy plentiful, but it hit the spot very well. There were a good amount of cubed potatoes, eggs, and steak with a wedge of orange and a banana bread-like dessert to finish up.\n\nAn all-around delicious, well-balanced breakfast. Can't complain!\n\nRecommendation(s): Steak & Egg Breakfast for Breakfast"
4,If only there was one of these off the strip! The dough was cooked to absolute perfection and i was impressed with the amount of in house ingredients and locally sourced dairy and produce. Even being on the strip you'll be hard pressed to find dining this good at these prices. While specialty pies top out at $15 you can still go for a Margherita at a shade under $8. Also while the beer list is not long or cheap they feature two taps from Goose Island in addition to fairly standard offerings. I found the staff to be pleasant as well. All of that combined with the proximity to other good eateries equals five stars for me.
3,"As a parent with 3 hungry children, CiCi's is a great choice for dining out.  Great price and the food really is pretty decent.  The fact that it is all you can eat makes it a great value.  The employees have always been very friendly.  I love the fact that you can make a special request for a pizza that they don't already have made and they will gladly fix it up for you."
2,First trip here tried mix grill and beef swarma.
1,"This is a brunch review only: it has a great atmosphere here, BUT the brunch food is so overpriced for very average quality. It was slow to arrive and portions weren't great. Nothing unique. I will admit the dinners are much better."
0,"50 dollars for a 3 pound poodle puppy cut, kinda excessive..."
2,"Growing up in Germany eating swiss and belgian chocolate, having traveled to bruges and spending an entire day gouging on chocolate and washing it down with a good trippel, I feel I have a good basis of comparison.\n\nImagine my excitement when I heard about this chocolate transplant, directly from the source.\n\nI personally feel that the highlight of your visit here is going to be the chocolate dipping experience. I think it equals if not surpasses anything that the melting pot has to offer. White, chocolate, and dark chocolate terrines wait expectantly for you to dip a variety of interesting morsels into them. Not just your plebeian strawberry and bananas, but a smorgasboard of salami, salty potato chips, cheetos, cheese curds, mangos, and more. Enjoy this with a traditional summer drink, affogato, which is espresso poured over gelato.\n\nAs for the chocolate offerings themselves...after taking home a box of four ranging from marzipan to amaretto - I was grievously disappointed at the taste and texture of the chocolate. In fact it was so lackluster and did nothing to awaken in me any sense of nostalgia, that I did not even finish them. For a chocolate lover, this was a surpising moment.  A sad day indeed."
3,"The Nike store at the premium outlet mall is one of the best places to get all your outlet gear at fantastic prices.  The store is huge, one of the biggest stores in the mall, and the selection and pricing are second to none."
0,"This place has pretty nice decor when you walk in, we can here for lunch and got the lunch specials, which was very inexpensive and a pretty good deal. Comes with soup, salad and soda for $6.95. my bf ordered the pad thai and I got the chicken with bell  peppers and basil. It was just bleh and ok to my taste. They gave us hot mustard which I felt was very chinese and not too thai authentic."
3,"Enjoyed it a lot. Good crowd going on a Thursday night when I pulled in by chance - just walking by. Menu looked interesting. Casual but cozy atmosphere. Scored a decent table despite just walking in off the street with no reservation on a Thurs night and was seated quickly.\n\nStarted with a chicken soup of the day and then the Sznycel Mielony - tasty ground meat with mushroom sauce served along with some fried potatoes and what I can only guess was some cabbage? should have asked, but it was good.\n\nLimited wine menu by the glass but I found a Canadian Mission Hill cab from the Okanagan Valley that went nicely."
0,Bouncers are assholes working with the cops to generate revenue.  Be careful if you go here.
4,Had a flat tire on our trailer while on vacation. AAA recommended a place 20 miles away that we had to drive to on the flat. Yea right. I yelped for a tire shop and this place came up as 3.5 miles away. Hubby called and they had 4 of the correct tires in stock. They got us in immediately and charged us a cheaper price than AAA quoted.
3,"We'd also like to rant about how great Pepe's is. From our first visit, hungover after a night of Dbacks and Amsterdam, when I introduced Jenny to menudo (girl is from Arizona and had never menudo'd as a hangover remedy, can you believe it?) to yesterday, our first visit since going vegetarian, Pepe's is consistent. Prices, food, and service are all good and that's all anyone should be asking for in the Avenues."
3,"Stayed at the Palazzo for a crazy Halloween weekend in Vegas. \n\nWith almost no deals that weekend, being that the Cigar Convention AND that is was Halloween, we were going to pay a pretty penny anywhere we went. At least at the Venetian and Palazzo, you get a little suite with your room. \n\nI've stayed at the Venetian, and the Palazzo definitely feels like a mini upgrade. The building is newer, the rooms are modern-chic, and the room had a total of three tvs. One in the bathroom! \n\nI got to shower, while watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show, on Halloween. You can't beat that!!\n\nRoom service was fast and pretty affordable. The beds were very comfy, and the couch could have held 2 extra party crashers on it. The parking was confusing at first, but after one time, it's easy."
3,"return from sedona getaway last nite and the girl wants chinese - big surprise since we haven't eaten chinese in 3 days ! \n\nA bigger surprise - we haven't eaten here before - not sure how many times we've been to this shopping center - at least 20 times, yet our 1st visit to Noodle Palace. \n\nAnother surprise - we liked it ! simple, non-descript place. not too busy. We get the rolled noodle w/ XO sauce, Black Pepper Lamb, Onion Pancake, the roast duck noodle soup and we ordered a fish congee (soup ) to go for my daughter. total cost $30 including tea and rice - geez, that's some cheap eats !! \n\nall the food was decent - nuthin' earth shattering. but the girl and i agreed - the lamb was beef. the server and the cook insisted it wasn't that it was how they seasoned it that effected the texture and flavor - i guess and it did taste good, but lamb ? \n\nwe'll try again for sure"
3,"It's been awhile since I ate here. We stopped by on Sunday for lunch because I was craving breakfast food. I was expecting more expensive menu but was surprised to find a breakfast plate for $4.99. It was the SOS, the gravy on toasts caught my eyes. I live and die for sausage gravy and theirs was pretty good. They layered half a toast and half a sauage pattie and covered it with gravy with 2 eggs on the side. Lots of food for the price. The picky eater ordered wings, and the wings are of good size. Our lunch tab was less than $15 for 2 people, not bad not bad. The service was good as well, and it seems like they have a good crowd of regulars. I may just have to come here more often."
2,"We decided to try the famed Carnegie pastrami and corned beef inside the Mirage.  We put our name in for a booth and waited less than ten minutes. Bravo!!!  We sat down and all decided on the Woody Allen, which was a pound of corned beef and a pound of pastrami on two slices of rye bread.  The pastrami was tender and moist , but the corned beef was a bit on the dry side.   We did add their spicy mustard to liven up the meat and tried their whole pickles which were zesty and tasty.  The corned beef was exceptionally lean with the pastrami being on the fattier side.  Nothing to get really excited about, but fun to try."
0,"Just had a terrible experience at this location. The food was ok. However, our waitress was the worst I've ever had. She was confrontational when we asked her to fix an error she made on the bill. Then accused us of lying about booking a reservation on THEIR website that would provide a $25 coupon. She claimed it only worked 90% of the time and it was our fault that they didn't receive the confirmation even though we printed out the confirmation and brought it with us. Will never eat there again. This waitress completely ruined our experience. Joes stone crab is 1000x better and will be going there from now on. You guys just lost 6 customers. You can thank your waitress."
2,"This was my first time visiting Five Guys and I have to say I wasn't prepared for the experience.\n\nI mean I wasn't prepared financially. I walked in with $10 in my pocket and after looking up at the menu I quickly realized I'd be walking out with only a burger- no fries, and no drink. So, disappointed, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger \""all the way\"" with no pickles (pickles are plain evil). That ran $7.45 after tax by itself. The $2.99 for medium fries and $2.50 for a drink they are asking made my jaw drop. I heard the fries are good but no way they are $3 good.\n\nYes, I'm cheap, but I have to be. I'm broke and under-employed. The prices here are just too much.\n\nAs for the burger, It was pretty darn good I must say. Nice and juicy, big and meaty. I liked the grilled onions. They gave the burger a unique taste.\n\nAs good as the burger was, I can't see paying over $7 for one so I won't be back to Five Guys anytime soon.\n\nWhat gave me a good laugh while I was waiting for the burger was a big sign they have up on the wall that says \""Voted Best Bargain\"" by the Washington times or some east coast paper. \n\nBTW, I stopped at a Circle K on the way home and got a 32oz coke to wash it down for 79 cents!"
2,"Honey Bear's BBQ has a few great BBQ options. For a Phoenix BBQ joint, it is top of line in quality. I can not say as much for the service or atmosphere.\n\nAs far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country.\n\nHoney Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business.\n\nPro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed. And be sure to check in on yelp to redeem your offer."
1,"This is an update to my full review below.  \n\nI have been chided by yelp message -- probably from the owner or his friend -- that it is OK to call a tortilla dish \""rarebit.\""  My feeling is that if you were going for a zany take on rarebit that an insider would get, no luck. I moved here from Britain. When I saw the tortilla labeled \""rarebit\"" my reaction was: This place doesn't know what they are doing. Admittedly, the item on the menu labeled \""spanish\"" is far weirder."
4,"My favorite thing about Stalzy's is that they stick to the basics but they do them really well. The menu may not sound super impressive in comparison to the prices but when you get your meal the quality is superb. These sandwiches are made with quality, local ingredients and with the above average drink selection they really provide the deli experience I expect. Dont let the simple titles fool you this top notch food is worth of your lunch(or breakfast) hour any day.\n\nMy sandwich of choice is the ham and swiss, simple, delectable, delicious :)"
4,"I've seen Alegria (in Philadelphia, PA) and was pleased to see the same high quality presentation and music in O. The high-divers, cross-divers, and the guy who was chillaxing while on fire were all amazing, as were the endless list of other performers that were there.\n\nO took it to the next level with their diving pool stage/setup. Watching folks swim synchronously and never come up for air (not from this side of the pool, that is), and watching folks slowly sink into the water without a care and not come back up was as mysterious as a Cirque du Soleil show can get.\n\nO kept my attention the entire time - recommended!"
3,"I visited Scottdale with the kids---was very happy initially to find a place that was easy on the wallet.  But then I ordered the Corn Beef Hash (recommended by the waittress), and WOW---that was just a wonderful experience that I will definitely revisit next time I'm in the neighborhood!"
0,"The fish special I ordered tonight tasted like boiled water and it had the consistency of a microwaved dinner. It was served on a uninspired bed of overcooked red cabbage and frozen cubed carrots. Just Awful, I couldn't finish it.\n\nThe waitstaff was very apologetic and offered carrot cake and chocolate cake as well but the carrot cake was mediocre at best. It was dry and the topping was salty.\n\nOverall, very disappointed."
4,"Oh Grimaldi's you never disappoint do you.  \n\nThis was my first visit to the Grimaldi's located in DC Ranch.  I didn't expect anything different from this location.  The pizza was superb and the service was great.  Our waiter was almost too attentive to our needs at times, but I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.  The pizza came out very quickly within 10 minutes of placing the order.\n\nPepperoni and Jalapeno all the way all day everyday!\n\nThe location was a bit of a ghost town though.  There were a lot of \""available for lease\"" buildings all over the place.  I'm not sure what happened, but it's a shame, because the location is great and has the potential."
0,Ok first and last time here.  Tried the adobo fried rice omelette the rice is bland! I also had a custom order made which was incorrect. I told the cashier I cannot have pork in it. Asked if they can substitute the adobo for chicken katsu. He asked the cook and the cook says no that the rice already has the adobo mixture. I'm like ok can you do just chicken katsu and egg omelette? (Since no attempt on fresh rice will be made) the cook's expression was like it was a burden. Really? What's hard of cooking made to order eggs and put cooked chicken in it. Well when I finally get to my destination and hubby went to open his food why was their rice with pork in it? I am very disappointed!
4,"University Animal Hospital has provided the best care for our fur kids! The compassion, knowledge, and expertise that both Dr. Ware and Dr. Koch have shown in caring for our girls is amazing. I wouldn't trust anyone else in caring for our pups!"
0,"Spent a while walking around trying to decide where to eat, and ended up stopping here.\n\nThe food was fine.  I liked my dish, but it wasn;t spectacular.\n\nThe service was really terrible.  We were sitting outside and saw our waitress three times.  When the order was taken and when the food was ready and when she brought the check.  There was no asking if we wanted more booze (even though she had already upsold us on the original margarita), and getting her attention when she was walking by to service the other table was impossible.  After she left the check we waited about 20 minutes for her to come and run the card, but that never happened.  Had to ask the hostess to take care of it.  She gave it to the server who, annoyed, returned it with a simple \""there you go\"".\n\nHopefully she was just having a bad night but that wasn't the impression that I got."
2,18 dollars for 4 meatballs is not a great deal! The food is ok. But I think this place is over priced. Ambience is not that great either.
1,"Price is a bit high for what amounts to bar food.  Don't expect too many smiles from the people working here....and if you do buy one of their overpriced sodas, don't expect any free refills, refills are at full price.  I also have a problem when I spend $20 for food and get a tiny kiddie cup of water!  I will not be back."
4,"My girl like this place.It was my first time drinking coffee with her and I enjoyed it as well.The staff was knowledgeable and nice.I like this place not sure why,but i will return again!!!"
4,"Wow, what a hike! Like Camelback, Piestewa Peak is a workout! And like Camelback, it is as hard going down as it was going up.  The top provides a perfect 360 view of the Valley, but yesterday it was pretty smoggy, so seeing downtown was a tad hard. Even still, a great view.\nI found Piestewa to be much more peaceful at the top than Camelback...probably because there weren't a ton of people up there when we made it to the top. However, my peaceful thinking at the summit was interrupted by a man who decided this was the best time to make a speech about his best friend...who just happened to be Jesus.\n\nWe hiked the Summit Trail and while there were definitely a lot of people there since it was gorgeous out yesterday, it didn't feel as crowded as Camelback and there were times where it was just me and my husband. Close to the summit are handrails, which come in handy on the way down.  Parking was 100% better than Camelback...plenty of spots and the turnover was pretty quick at the lot at the Summit Trail trailhead. It looked like there were other lots nearby, so parking is not a chore like it is at Camelback."
3,"Just in case you are looking for a breakfast place, they have brunch only on the weekends! We went in for lunch. Walked into this cool little home-like restaurant and felt at ease. The vibe is wonderful, the seats are comfortable, the staff was very nice and cool. I very much enjoyed the service, the atmosphere and the prices! Man it was cheap. It is a self seat, at least during the week. We sat, in the comfortable chairs and waited briefly. My buddy ordered the po' boy sandwich (I am pretty sure) and  I ordered like a flatbread open faced sandwich. We both enjoyed what we ordered, but felt that they could add a couple of things to improve the food. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and for the price, it was rockin. If they would have put some black beans & peppadews, or Jalapa\u00f1os and Mango (hell or even black beans and greek olives) on the flatbread sandwich, it would have been absolute bliss. My buddy said that his was really good, but it was in need of some onions. Maybe that could be an option later? Either way, thoroughly enjoyable, will probably be back."
4,"First time here. Party of seven. Good, casual atmosphere. Our sever, Tori was fantastic ! No mistakes, no ' let me check' No drinks went empty, can't ask for much more than that. I'm not too picky, but the Wife & Daughter can be. Everyone's steak was cooked perfect ! Others had Prime rib, strip's, a Porterhouse, My Country Fried Steak was fork tender, no need for a knife, which is my first barometer, my second is flavor both passed with flying colors. gravy was tasty and it wasn't swimming in it, just enough to have some on each bite. All the food was tasty ! If anything was 'just average' it was the onion rings...but those are one thing that I AM picky about, haven't found great onion rings in Phoenix since I got here in '95. Wife said the sweet potato was the best she's had, even her own..lol. Everyone's first bite was followed with a ..WOW, ALL plates cleaned which is not usually the case with our crowd. Will be our new go to place, Outback just lost 7-10 regular customers. Well worth the extra 2-3 mile drive each way in my book."
3,"There was a cornhole competetion going on when we got there. Clean, good pizza and calzones. Bucket of beer for $10. Not bad all around, but might question heading into that part of town at night."
1,Sales are a joke. The clearance was only 20% meanwhile the same things at another BRU on Northwest was 50%. I guess their rent is much higher here. They have good amount of selections but the prices is not so hot. I'll be shopping at a different BRU. Thank you very much.
2,"I will reiterate what many others have said. Food is above average. Service is poor. We've been there half a dozen times and besides waiting a long time for our food, they almost always forget something or bring us the wrong food. With better servers/server training, this place could be 4 stars easy."
2,"Sampled the hazelnut, tiramisu, pistachio gelato and decided NOT to get any. They were creamy buttery lacking flavor. The creme brulee was ok. My friends did like their sorbets. \nChocolate fountain was kind of cool. \nThere are better gelato places than this. I liked Sugar and Ice in Wynn Hotel."
1,"How good this place is really depends when you go; I've had some great nights here but these have been balanced out by some really awful ones!\n\nWhat's great about WhistleBinkies is that it's the only place in Edinburgh I know that has live music on every night. However this music is different every day, so you could get everything from traditional scottish folk through to ska through to heavy metal. My advice would be to do your homework - check their website to see who's playing every day, or play it safe and go on a monday for their Open Mic night.\n\nWhat's bad about it is the drinks prices. You can expect to pay \u00a33.50-\u00a35.50 per drink, which would be ok if there was ever anywhere to sit. Although the quirky alcoves, various nooks and crannies, sofas and upturned barrels for tables do give the place a certain rustic charm, there are simply not enough of them.\n\nIf live music is the most important thing for your night out, this is probably your place. If you want loo-roll in the bathrooms, ice in your drinks and somewhere to sit... then it's probably not."
2,Stick with the beers at this place.  Their beers were superb but their apps were so-so.  Had the lobster tacos and the fois gras peanut butter and jelly.  Both were ok.
2,"I was having a staycation and decided to try something different...how much fun can I have without leaving the Palazzo? The restaurant was nice, we sat in the booth right in the front window which was actually pretty cool. The wait staff was attentive and very professional. Honestly though, I've had better steak at the local steakhouses off the strip. Not a bad meal at all, probably made better by someone else picking up the check!"
3,"it's all about Sunday brunch mimosas, French toast, and a room full of desserts. This is my fave place to go in Vegas for breakfast type food. It is all tasty and reasonably priced compared to other Vegas buffets. I cannot wait to nurse my hangover at this place once again!"
4,"*STOP SEARCHING BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT AND GO* \n\nOK....Service was out of this world! From sitting down and immediately having water, to drinks being brought right away. Never an empty glass. All servers were so happy and polite. \n\nFood was put of this world....from citrus chicken to chow mein. Also, how did they make fried rice taste like heaven!? Seriously, I could not stop. Fresh and not greasy. HUGE portions. \n\nCame in at 630ish on a Friday night and was empty. Within an hour it was jammed packed. We met George!!! Not only does he walk around and talk to customers, HE WORKS! From serving to bussing. Blew me away. \n\nThe Yelp check-in deal is over a year old. He is having some trouble with Yelp. He explained his issue, and it sounds legit. He did honor it because we came all the way from Chandler. \n\nWE WILL BE BACK ASAP!! \n\nFYI....taste amazing left over and even cold. That's legit."
3,"Super yummy Roma pizza- glad I made the trip. Arugula salad a little underdressed, chopped salad was wonderful. Probably could have staffed up for a Saturday night but staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back."
1,"We had the crab-pineapple dip with wontons for an appetizer. Crab and pineapple in a tasteless white goo, really a bad idea. We really did not want to put together our idea of a bowl of food, but that's the way it works. The beef in our dish had several pieces of gristle, and the rest of the dish was a bit overcooked for my taste. We did try several of the sauces but none did anything worthy of mention. The chocolate-filled wantons with a whipped cream side were very good, and my extra-dirty traditional gin martini was very cold and surprisingly good. Service is friendly but untrained. Several times our server should have seen we needed extra plates or silverware, but she was oblivious. We were sadly disappointed."
1,"We just spent four nights here @$84 a night .  We paid to be in the \""updated\"" north tower...non smokers....only thing updated was the bathroom (which was very nice).  The carpet was filthy, stains throughout.  Having read previous reviews about bedbugs, we did check and found none.  The room itself was cleaned and vacuumed daily.  The location was ok however several homeless people seem to reside on the grounds, in fact going into the fountains at the front scooping up the coins.  The moving sidewalk never moved, nor did,the upstairs one. \"" temporarily broken\"" the sign said.  The buffet??  Hah!  We went there once for breakfast....without a doubt the worst offering ever.  Surly server.   The elevators are dirty as well as the urine smelled parkade.   This place is old, old, old and looks it, smells like it.  No wifi...unless big $$.Count us as \""never to return\"" patrons."
4,"The best Italian in Charlotte.  Period.  I have been going there on Sunday night for 20 years.  The food, the people and the ambience cannot be replaced by any other restaurant I have ever frequented."
1,"I used to love it here. For years it was the best burger in town. But, I have to say the last couple times we've been here I've been really disappointed. The burger is BLAND now. I have to take this place off the list, too bad. Houston's/Hillstone burger has never disappointed, so we'll be going there from now on."
3,"I love sushi, so obviously I am a fan of Nobu's. The fish is always so fresh and delicious. My favorite is the yellowtail with the jalapenos.\n\nWe came here for a friend's birthday. The experience was good. The bad thing was the location of our table. There was a large table with a birthday right behind us, and they were all standing around like it was a night club for at least 45 minutes. My chair got bumped several times, until I was finally so irritated, I was ready to leave.\n\nThe ice cream things with the rice paper are amazing (sorry, forgot what they are called!). Oh, and try the lobster ceviche - YUM!\n\nThis place is very expensive, so be prepared for the sticker shock."
3,I really liked the wide selection of beers that they offered! However I do think they need more seating for busier nights!
4,"This place makes my innards tingle. The atmosphere is energized and the food is absolutely top notch. Much to be said about this joint. It's great for a date or small groups. Staff is awesome and attentive. Overall, I will go here frequently."
4,"Yay!! I'm so happy I FINALLY found a groomer I like! Lilac was great with my two dogs and their haircut was beautiful. They were both nice and fluffy when I picked them up.. and the best part.. no knicks or razor burns anywhere! (This is a plus since I've had too many problems with other groomers in town) The salon was super clean and Lilac was very nice and accommodating. And if you check in on Yelp, you get $10 off!! Two thumbs up!"
4,"If you are visiting Montreal you should make some time to walk this part of the Island. Beautiful little stores, cafes & the port are a few of the things to take in. Great to walk thru with your camera. The restaurants here are usually quite busy so book ahead and parking is limited so be sure to walk or take public transport! Be sure to spend a night or afternoon exploring this part of town. Old cobblestone on the streets so ladies leave your heals at home!"
1,Not empressed  at all my friend waited for this  sandwich  shop to open. We got so excited. I ordered a sandwich  and it was very bland and they didn't even toast it. It looked so pale that it didn't look appetizing. I ate half and I really didn't get excited.
4,"I absolutely love this car wash, they take great care of my car and the customer service is amazing!! Thank you Ecowash!"
1,"just got back from staying at the Bellagio Hotel for the first time.  All I can say is I was extremely disappointed especially for the price.  First we were put on a smoking floor without notification.  The room was out of date (no flat screen TV) and multiple fixture in the bathroom were falling off.  Turns out they were closing the floor right after we left for updating so they knew the room was not appropriate but still put us there for the weekend.  Finally, service at the front desk was grossly understaffed.  Checking out should not take 30 minutes. Overall would not go back. Better hotels in Vegas."
4,"My quick summary-  Normal bar food taken to a whole 'nother level.\n\nI rarely travel to this neighborhood in Scottsdale, but when I do, I always stop at KO's.  This is a nice, friendly neighborhood bar.  The owner is a nice guy, the staff is always friendly & courteous.  They have fun activities, like poker tournaments, on certain days.  They have TVs in every inch of the restaurant, so you never miss a game.  You can easily spend a couple hours here.\n\nThe menu is pretty amazing.  They have your basic bar food like potato skins, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  But, the manage to elevate their food to something surprising and unexpected.  Their chicken sandwich with pesto & cheese, so good & unexpected for a location like this.  Yet simple enough to make you wonder why other places can't manage good food like this.  I maintain their sweet potato fries are the best in the valley.  Their mac & cheese is worth the calories and cholesterol.\n\nI ordered their grilled cheese one day, without tomatoes.  When it came, they forgot & added them by mistake.  Didn't bother me, I was willing to take them off.  But the waiter took it back, had them make me fresh one, and then took it off the bill.  All without me asking.\n\nAn excellent place to watch the big game or just pop in for a quick lunch."
3,"I have eaten there 3 times. Two of the times the service was great, friendly, attentive.  One time not so much but still OK\n\nThe food is fresh and tasty.  Overpriced like everything in the big hotels but not too outrageous. Most of the seating is out on the patio but there is a cozy, quiet seating area inside if that is what you want.  My wife makes the best pesto I have ever had but this was pretty damn good."
2,"Food is great. Prices are through the roof. \nHostess is usually high on something and uses the \""F\"" word in every sentence. Also hogs the tables for annoyingly long time. We are there to eat not be your best \""F\"" buddies!!!!"
1,"My family and I were here staying at a near by Hotel and decided to go here, plus it was my husbands birthday. We got right in for a Saturday night. We ordered the sampler appetizer. This had no flavor. It was so bland. Then my husband ordered the chicken and broccoli pasta. He couldn't even eat it, it was so bland. No spices, no taste. I tried it and I couldn't even eat it. We sent it back. I got the top sirloin and it was basically a piece of fat that had been grilled. The kids didn't even eat their food. (One had chicken fried steak and the other kid ribs) I felt so bad for my husband because he had a terrible birthday dinner meal. We ended up paying our bill, and getting snacks afterwards to compensate. The service was good, but not attentive. We will not ever visit another Claim Jumper again."
2,"Wholly mounds of meat, Batman!  Carnegie Deli is a casual deli located in the Mirage on the Las Vegas strip.  The friend who recommended Carnegie warned us that the portions are huge and she was NOT joking.  The sandwiches are mountains of meat that can easily feed a small country.\n\nWe had the Brisketball, which is topped with turkey and brisket and the Woody Allen which is topped with pastrami and corned beef.  Each was absolutely delicious.  Plus, Carnegie has a wonderful spicy mustard that complements their sandwiches well.\n\nIf you're eating at Carnegie be sure to come hungry and bring some friends because these sandwiches are not for the faint of heart.  My only regret is that was too full to try one of their cheesecakes."
4,I called Mike to repair our Kitchen Aid refrigerator.  He was able to fit the repair call in his schedule and was very prompt.  He offered me options with regards to the repair as well as his professional opinion.  Mike is a highly experienced professional and brings years of expertise.  I feel the fees were very fair for the work that was required and would not hesitate to call Mike again.
0,"Let Down. \n\nThe concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre \""tastes\"" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.  \n\nFor the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.  \n\n**This review is based upon trying the following:\n--pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart)\n--When Pigs Fly\n--Dan dan noodles\n--Lengua tacos\n--Pork belly tacos with pineapple\n--Carnitas\n\nCan you believe all of this was $100+? Avoid. \n\n**Disclosure: I am a big Jose Andres fan, live in DC, and eat at all his restaurants."
2,"Just driving by Camelback with an empty stomach... Mexican's food sure why not??? Padre's...we sat in the patio area... our server was nice... we order the ceviche right away, it was really tasty... after that we had the calamari which were under cook and the fish taco which were not bad but it needed more sauce or maybe a more flavorful sauce, it was a lillte dry :( ....  drinks were good...Happy hour menu looks nice, we might be back..."
2,"I have a mixed opinion on this place.  I have ate here three times, with one YUM experience, one \""That was pretty good\"" and one \""eeeehhhhh\"" that was ok experience.\n\nThe salmon salad is DELICIOUS!  I would highly recommend it for a healthy option.  I also saw a few friends get it.  The only thing I will say is that the actual salmon portion has looked a little inconsistent.\n\nI got the Buffalo Chicken wrap with grilled chicken instead of fried.  It was pretty good, nothing special.  \n\nMy ehhhhhh dish was the Prime Rib sandwich.  I was really excited to try it, especially after my server spoke so highly of it, but I was disspointed.  I think the worst part was the bun it was served on.  It was what I'd consider a \""sandwich bun\"" you would get at a cafeteria, with weird seed things on it.\n\nGood drink specials....Bud Light for $2 and Bloody Mary bar with a million sauces and mixes for $3.  The upstairs patio is awesome!  Though doesn't compete with the new member of the neighborhood's Peculiar Rabbit."
2,"Very nice. I cannot believe this was my first time going to Target out here...now that I think about it, it reminds me of the one close to Falls Church. The parking lot is very large and has good lighting. And they have security which patrols the area. The inside of the store is equally nice and bright. So the reason for the three stars and not five...the one product I was looking for...they were out of stock. Lose one star. And I used the restroom...although this was cleaner than most, it still needed cleaning. The floor was sticky with something...and most of the toilets were unusable (I will just stop here...do not want to give you a mental picture). \nOverall if I'm in the area and need something simple, I may return. By all means it beats walmart on any given day."
4,"Everything was great.  Requested to split two entr\u00e9es and four separate plates came out...As requested, split entrees."
1,"Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice."
0,"WORST MASSAGE OF MY LIFE! I literally left in tears, it was so painful. Yelp reviews are way wrong. Ended up paying $76 for two massages. Total of $100. I gave them a $100 bill and they look confused when I asked them for change. I asked the guy to be more gentle about 5 times and he did not listen. Go to the other places around this area, they are 10-20/hr. What a waste of $100 and now I probably need to see a chiropractor to fix my back because of these people.  So I just said F* this place and walked out. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!"
2,"Because I'm gluten intolerant, I give Picazzo's 5 stars for their extensive gluten-free menu.  I can go there and eat normally without feeling left out!  I've also had very good service when I've eaten there.\n\nMy one problem with them, and this is a big one, is that I've gone there 3 times in the past 8 months and they've been closed during regular business hours.  Two of those times were to get GF dough to go.  The other time was after the movies when my hubby and I were having date night.  We don't go out often in this economy, so we were both dressed up and ready to have a nice meal.  But we couldn't because they were closed.  I e-mailed the manager of Picazzo's to tell him about this, and to ask if they'd still honor the coupon that was only good for that weekend that we wanted to use, but he never got back to me.  Since then, I've been mail ordering different GF pizza crust from a company in Scottsdale.  When I plan on eating out, it's a big deal because I can't just go drive through Mickey D's or someplace else because I have to eat GF.  Eating out can really be a chore when you have to eat GF.  I was initially thrilled with Picazzo's for the fact that they had a GF menu alone, but if they aren't going to be reliable or respond to my complaint, then I'll take my business elsewhere or just eat at home."
1,"Persian room is a great place with notable portions which equates to lunch the next day.\nHowever, if you get anything to go, the portions are severally reduced; with the exception of the rice. I would've taken back if I didn't live 20 min north .\nThe portion of Persian macaroni was laughable for the price, and the tour of Persia at almost $40 was borderline fraud.\nIf you want Persian, eat in house, not to go."
2,"This place was okay, I wasn't too impressed. The neighborhood is great, but I didn't feel like the coffee shop was anything special. There isn't a lot of table space, so it's hard to do work.\n\nThe drinks were good, though. Seemed to be mostly fair priced. \n\nLike I said, it was good, but nothing special. I may or may not come back."
0,Well...  the only thing I can say is.... if you like your food to have one consistent flavor ...no matter what choice you make.. being  the flavor of the grill... then this place is for you. It all tastes the same to me... the same strange grill flavor.  I know it's fast food... but... I will not being going back as there are plenty of other options out there. \n\n1 star IMO. \nHatch
2,"Being a full-time grad student, I frequent coffee houses frequently. This Starbucks was pleasant enough overall, but the lady taking my order had the personality of a lima bean. This location should put heir friendly staff as the first point of contact and leave the grumpy smurfs behind the counter, where they can make some coffee magic and not have to interact with humans. \n\nAlso, the place was relatively empty, yet not one of the three ladies behind the counter thought to take a broom to the place. Not very clean and no effort to correct that. \n\nOur breakfast and coffees were delicious, though. No complaints there!"
3,This is a great little Italian restaurant the serves fresh creative foods. It has a reasonably priced wine list that features some great tastes. I have been there a number of times for both lunch and dinner. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the silverware. They use that flat tinny stuff with sharp edges. It is a pet peeve for me. All the chef's hard work to provide a great food experience is diminished when the sharp edge of the fork scrapes across your lips.
3,"Love this place.  I don't think I tried anything I didn't like.  My favorite were the bacon wrapped dates, yum!  Service was a tad spotty, some things came out quick, while others did not.  It can get a tad bit noisy, especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  I will definitely be back."
1,"I guess the nice thing to say would be that they had beer and I didn't get food poisoning?\n\nThe staff pretty much could care less if you're there or not - I don't think I've experienced a server that was that checked-out in a long time. My food was edible, but came on a plastic plate? For real?? Is there not a real kitchen back there? No dishwasher. Very ungreen. Much like the rest of Phoenix.\n\nIf I didn't have a meal voucher from United and had to pay for what I consumed this would be a one-star. I'd rather eat Wendy's."
0,Cupcakes look so good but don't live up to taste test not at  $2.50 a pice.
2,"This was a nice CLEAN place. However, the thing I did not like was that the guy doing my pedi kept stopping to greet people walking in and answer the phone. Super annoying. Took longer than expected because of all the interruptions."
0,"so i drove by there the other day. they closed. no surprise there, and no big loss. better luck next time."
1,"I planned a bachelorette party for my friend and there were 6 of us. At first  we chose the $25 pp package with limo pickup, admission and 2 drinks until I read in fine print does not include limo ride back to hotel. So then we went with the package of $45 pp to include limo pickup and drop off, VIP entrance, reserved seating, and 2 drinks. All along they tell you please do not be late for limo pickup so I made sure we were on time, however the limo was about 40 min late and not only that they show up in a shuttle bus!! Not cool! And there was another group of girls with us which was ok but not what we paid for. The driver did apologize and said there would be a limo to take us back. Then we pull up to Hustler club. No where in the info I looked up said it was at the hustler. Again no big deal but would've been nice to know that's where it was at. No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty. And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early. Seated limited! Ok so the male strippers were good with the girls and bride to be, however their bodies were all so stubly or prickly as though the hadn't been freshly waXed or shaved. A big turn off! Never the less we had a good time. I just wish it was a little more organized! Ands since we paid that much money and then had to pay another $60 to get bride onstage was a little much."
0,First time they served me oatmeal in a cup. Second time they have no hot chocolate and I still had to wait in the drive thru. Unsure why the management staff is unable to order the right amount of inventory. Im not giving a 3rd chance to be disappointed.
1,"Overhyped, overpriced and now host to one of the ugliest structures in the world, it is FREMONT STREET.\n\nOnce the hub of Vegas, Fremont Street is now relegated to the status of carnival attraction despite the heroic, if mostly unsuccessful, attempts to attract visitors.\n\nFrom the let down of a light show (occasionally they break out a good one) to the greedy and mostly untalented street performers (I appreciate good ones but really how much talent does it take to dress up like a transformer or superman), Fremont Street Experience is simply a means to an end.  The addition of the Long Bar has only made drinks more expensive.  It is next to impossible to find the inexpensive tables near the freemont street entrance anymore.\n\nSo how do they bring people to Freemont.  Apparently it is by building the world's largest, and ugliest, slot machine to double up the zipline availability (and cost).  While many unsuspecting twentysomethings will give it a whirl, it is just another eyesore coming to vegas.\n\nWhy two stars?  Well there are still some gems on Fremont and some new places that are worth a go pop up.  Plus it is still cheaper than the strip and more of a party atmosphere.\n\nBest of all, they do have good stage shows especially during the concert series."
2,"Good not great pizza. This is a chain store there big thing is flavored crusts which is pretty good. I go with butter!\n\nAllergy alert: Their sauce does not have garlic in it so if you know of someone who has a garlic allergy they can eat this pizza sauce without worry of garlic (make sure to check again before trying it, just to make sure)."
3,"Getting caught up on my reviews!!!\n\nMet up here with a dear friend recently.  It is a really cute place and I am so glad they have decided to invest in downtown Glendale.  We went during the week, around 5 PM, for catch-up and some beverages.  The menu is small and we ordered a burrata and some deviled eggs.  My friend had wine and I had some cocktails which were lovely.  We met the chef, who shared some of his ideas with us.  The meal itself was enjoyable all around.  \n\nI DO have a suggestion though:  our hostess was not very involved during our time there.  It's SO important to engage first-time customers; familiarity with the menu and the ability to make recommendations when asked are the way to create return business.  Ours was virtually non-existent and couldn't answer the most basic questions.  You may want to revisit her training as you build your clientele.\n\nBest of luck to you, Cuff!"
1,"So one day we're waiting on a prescription and absolutely ravenous. We avoided all of the chains and stumbled on Heidi's while turning around in their parking lot. \n\nThe place was VERY clean. The owners(?) were there, and very friendly. My husband got a BLT and it was pretty good. I got the 'Awesome Salad' and it was anything but awesome. Chopped iceburg, DICED tomatoes, slices of mozzarella and what has GOT to be pre-packed quacamole (it tasted like rotten eggs) - all jammed into a clear plastic to-go container. \n\nI've never been so angry about a salad."
2,"Went here with a large group and the service was good. However, the food was okay nothing amazing. They have a nice patio which would be great for happy hour. The   bruschettas were okay and kinda pricey. They do not have as many flavors as postinos. I also felt the taste of the bruschettas were not well balanced. However, our group did have a nice time. Next time, I will not order the white sangria it was small, too sweet, and full of ice. I think this is a better happy hour spot than anything else..."
2,"Idk, but I feel this place is more hype than legit. Curds were avg as was the burger I had. Not bad but not great. Idk if it is worth the wait."
2,"It's a Vegas buffet what else can I say. It was $88.00 for two of us on Sunday night. I'm not a huge buffet fan but it was my partners first time in Vegas so we had to go to one. Would I go back? Well yes if they wanna comp me but no if I have to pay. Again, not saying it's bad just saying typical Vegas buffet. Everyone should try it once. I just feel for $88.00 I can get a better meal that's not a buffet."
1,"I live nearby and the 2 star rating is based on 10+ visits. Most unfavorable experience is with their waiters. I tip them regular base 15% and I expect much better service. I won't be their place anymore. \n\nThings I have experienced with this place:\n\n1) Go there lunch time around 1:30 PM for three times on week days, wait 5-10 min for waiter came to ask what to eat today, wait another 30+ min for the noodle while the restaurant is only 70% full. \n\n2) Go there 8:00PM later for four to five times on week days, speed is normal, wait 15min and get the dish. I order same noodle same size, they actually put less things than they did in lunch time, politely point out that to their waiter and they say they just put less soup and it looks 'less'. Highly suspecting they are kinda run out noodles and meats and don't want make new before they close door.\n\n3) One time when I found there are too little soup for train size - large size bowl and my large size looks no difference with friend's just right - mid size bowl, I ask waiter add soup and guess what? Waiter told me extra soup (refill soup) is charged. I can not believe they just say it... Totally out of my expectation\n\n4) Another time I was in at lunch peak, I and my friends, four people, their waiter arranged two other guests came in later than us order first and let us wait. No excuse, there are a lot of table available at the time. Waiters not professional.\n\n[JUST ABOUT FOOD]:\nFood itself is good. Above medium around Pho noodle restaurants I have visited at Chicago, DC, Denver and Charlotte.\n\n[ADVICE TO MANAGER]:\nHire more waiter and chef for peak hours.\nTrain your waiter to be professional.\nTreat your customer fair, okay?"
3,"We were promptly seated in a booth, as requested, and soon had menus in hand and ice water on the table.  A delightful spinach salad with fennel, cranberries, carrots and a basil dressing was shared.  Ms. Westie ordered wild Atlantic salmon roasted on a cedar plank in a blueberry sauce.  I chose the wild mixed grill - Chilean sea bass, king salmon and a shrimp cake which was accompanied by risotto and grilled asparagus.  Both meals were excellent though Ms. Westie's salmon was slightly overdone.  My meal included their signature cr\u00e8me brulee plus, as a birthday present, I received another dessert of my choice.  We selected the chocolate truffle with raspberry ganache because it sounded great and traveled well.  As a member of McCormick & Schmick's loyalty program I used a free entr\u00e9e coupon that I received a few months prior for my birthday"
0,"I've been waiting a few weeks before posting a review because I wanted to be as fair as possible. On the good side, this company was prompt to return my calls & were sort of on time to appear (they came at the very tail end of their time window.)\n\nOn the bad side, they sent someone who didn't speak very much English & he couldn't understand what I wanted to have done on the trees. I was really hoping for a real arborist who could help me understand the different options, but I ended up just pointing and hoping for the best. When I came back after running some quick errands, I found most of my tree on the ground & somehow it still looked as scraggly as it started! I called the owner to complain and he said a) that I didn't know what I was talking about, b) that I was looking for a free trim job, and c) that he could come by to look at it and to tell me that he thought it looked good (his opinion from the few cell phone photos that the trimming guy sent to him.)\n\nThey've been calling every few days to see when they could come and tell me that the tree looks fine, but honestly, I don't think that will help me feel better at all. I don't really want to talk to them again after being so insulted when I was really upset over the bad trim my tree had gotten from them...\n\nMaybe if you speak Spanish and already know everything you need to know about trees, this would be an okay company to try, but I think that the owner should really consider whether or not he should personally meet new clients to better understand their needs and also really, really consider what he says to them."
1,"The Christmas light display was recommended. Lights were extremely disappointing, but the live nativity scene should appeal to the Christian visitors. Very large gift shop. Did not visit the museum so I can not comment on that part of the site."
0,"DO NOT STAY HERE, especially if you have kids.  Substandard amenities.  Rooms are VERY outdated.  Even in the shower, water pressure is next to non-existent.  Pictures do not depict actual conditions at this property.  Went to the business center, found it in VERY poor condition, all equipment taken out.  Property needs an HUGE amount of work to bring it back up to par.  Parking behind the hotel kinda dark in the p.m.  Lots of non-guest foot traffic.  Was told by staff the top floors are occupied by people that live there.  They rent rooms as apartments.\n\nTraded through Interval International for this property, BIG MISTAKE!!!\n\nVERY DISASTIFIED"
4,"Just skimming through some of the reviews I saw that: \n\n-All people went for dinner\n-A lot of people like the decor\n-Most people liked the crab legs/seafood\n-Some people were not impressed with the decor or the crab legs/seafood\n-No one went here for breakfast.\n\nWell, guess what? I did. So did they have the run-of-the-mill Hashbrowns, breakfast sausage, bacon, ham and all you can drink orange juice? Of course. Did they have the tell'em to make whatever you want Omelette station? Yup. What about a variety of coffee and pancakes & French toast? C'mon, isn't that expected? So, you're probably thinking: WTF, Shannon? What's with the 5 stars???\n\nSmoked Bacon. Yeah, I know. \n\nNo, it's not \""Thick sliced Applewood, peppered, pan fried in it's own grease bacon\"". Just a big slab of pork belly, SMOKED. And waiting for you under the heat lamp at the carving station. I don't know about you but I've NEVER seen that. Big deal, right? Smoked bacon...so what? Well, next time you go to Vegas and aren't hungover enough to wake up right before dinner, roll out of bed early and go to Studio B Buffet at the M Resort. Go pay your $16 or whatever it is and go straight to that carving station. We'll see how unimpressed you are then. Smoked f*cking Bacon. \n\nOh and when you go, tell 'em Shannon sent you...\n\nNo, they won't know who the hell I am but just do it anyways. For laughs..."
0,"Rude front desk person, horrible experience.  The girl cutting/styling my hair wanted to send me out with just dry hair, no styling. I asked her to please style it and she gave me high school pin curls of some sort with 1/2 can hair spray.  I asked for a blow out, you know round brush?  Awful.  The \""free manicure\"" was just a polish change since they don't cut cuticles so what's even the point? She also ran out of time since it took 2 1/2 hours to trim and style my hair.  No thanks. Go to Paul Mitchell or Aveda Institute."
0,"There was a huge dead moth packaged with my broccoli stalk. This place used to be great until the new owners took over. Even the bags are cheaper and ripped open on me while I was carrying my groceries up the stairs -_-. But of course, the day I opened the fresh broccoli I had just bought to make me and my son some lunch, there was something black in it. I was like what the heck is that? Cut it open, and a HUGE, black, dead moth was there. Yum. I will never go there again because they are apparently not very hygienic where they package your food. This is my warning!"
0,Food took an HOUR to get to us.  Then it was cold but we were too hungry to send it back and have them spit in it.  I really enjoyed this place when it was in Mesa but they just lost a customer.  Horrible.
1,"The best thing was the pork belly. Wasn't impressed with the rolls, the baked mussels, dessert, or the menu.. I love sushi Kaya way more."
4,Today I had an appt for a general check up for my newly adopted pet. I've been petless for 8 years and was super happy to be able to find the vet who I used back then. I have to say. I've never had a better experience with a vet office. Everyone clearly loves animals and their jobs. I give them the highest recommendation.
1,"La Bocca is the definition of mediocre. \n\nI ordered a pizza for dinner, and it was bad. Not terrible, but bad. The crust was burnt in a couple places, yet the dough at the center of the pizza was almost underdone, and soggy. A sure sign of an oven with uneven heating issues. I took one bite of a slice and all of the cheese and toppings slid off, because the sauce was very watery. Overall an amateurly done pizza.\n\nI also ordered a lemoncello, and it came in the smallest glass I'd ever seen. I almost thought it was a joke. Maybe I'm just unaccustomed to how things are done in more \""upscale\"" types of places, but I've never had a cocktail come in a doll's glass before, so it was a bit of a shock. \n\nThe service was meh. I got the impression our waitress would have rather been somewhere else. \n\nI'm not sure why this place gets so many rave reviews. Maybe I went on a bad night. But for the price, I'm not really feeling the desire to give them a second chance."
3,"3.5 stars? My issues with Wynn management notwithstanding, the actual food at this buffet was great. My favorite dishes were the quinoa and brussel sprout salads, crab legs, rack of lamb, and charcuterie selection.\n\nNote that traditional eaters who want the 'usual' buffet fare might be disappointed, as almost everything here has some kind of twist or modification to make it stand out from the pack.\n\nDessert selection kind of lacked the 'wow' factor I was expecting, although the tres leches and creme brulee were yummy. I didn't try the crepe station, a decision I now regret. :( \n\nThe lines were really out of control. 45 minute wait in the regular line and 20 minute wait in the 'VIP' line. Although, it's not their fault they're popular.\n\nMy only real complaint is the service. Our waitress seemed depressed and was very inattentive, visiting only once to give us our drinks and another time to refill them, never asking if we needed anything else or how our meal was going. The bulk of our service came from the busboys, a pattern repeated at the Wynn's other restaurants during our stay."
4,"I am sad I didn't notice this place before. Tiny but very cute inside. \nHad a bbq pork empanada - super flaky and good - and a corn tamale, also great. \nVery reasonable price. \nMy new go to for last minute dinner! This is the best thing to happen to my corner!"
2,"I have only been to Cafe Rio once. Wait, that isn't quite accurate... I have only EATEN at Cafe Rio once, at this location. I tried going to another location a while back while on my lunch break and ended up walking out due to a very long, slow moving line. \n\nAllison S. and I were planning on getting some take out and decided to give the new neighborhood Cafe Rio a try. When we walked in the line was insane, but for how many people that were waiting to order and pay it moved fairly quickly. It took us about 25 minutes total to get through the line, order and pay. It was also quite loud, which made hearing the employee while ordering difficult. \n\nI ended up ordering a grilled chicken salad. Not a fan of places like Cafe Rio that charge more for \""fire grilled chicken\"" versus \""chicken\"" but I still paid the extra buck to have fire-grilled chicken. As previously mentioned, the ordering process was chaotic so when asked, I said I'd take everything on the salad. Total damage for the salad only was a little over $10. A bit steep, but the serving was quite large. \n\nThe food itself was good. Not great. Comparable to Chipotle (which I am not a huge fan of either) or Qdoba (which I prefer to this). That said, I still plan on returning to try other menu items.  Hopefully by the time I return some of the 'new business in the area' hype has died down.\n\nP.S. For whatever reason, this location isn't showing up on the website, so online ordering is not currently possible."

4,"Some people are wildly creative and enjoy putting together their own costume creation. Thankfully, for the rest of us who have no such skill set, but a desire to look good in our costumed glory, there is Showoff Costume Rentals. \n\nThere are countless places that pop up around Halloween with packaged costumes that look like every other costume in the Valley. They carry the same exact outfits next to the same exact accessories wall. Have you wondered were you could go to find a truly unique looking costume for an event?  Years ago, I stumbled on Showoff and have returned to them anytime I have needed a costume for an event.  \n\nMAKING AN APPOINTMENT: You must call ahead and make an appointment to go in. This is an important step. The shop is small so the owner, Gillian, doesn't have all of the costumes out on the floor for you to peruse. Instead you will discuss your costume idea and set up a time to get into the shop. When you arrive Gillian and/or an employee will have a number of options already set aside for you to consider. There is no better costume customer service in this town. Try getting anything like that kind of service at the pop-up shops. You simply tell Gillian what you are leaning toward and she will consider your specific theme and your size and she pull out costume options that fit your needs. \n\nYOUR APPOINTMENT TIME: You will show up and try on the options that they have selected. Whenever I've been there the owner has given me personal service. She looks at the costume on you, see how it fits, discusses the accessories, and helps customize the entire look. Customers don't have to worry about hanging around for hours. If you're like me, you will fall in love with the first or second option that they select for you. And the employees are right there to ring you up. No lines. \n\nOPTIONS: Showoff specializes in showgirl costumes.  And their selection is thorough. These are not thrown together costumes. The showgirl costumes are elegant, larger than life, and most importantly, glamorous.  I believe they are very careful with those rentals, so if you are looking for a showgirl rental, you will need to communicate with the owner. From what I've seen of their selection, there isn't any place in town with better Vegas-themes costumes But there are a wealth of other costumes available for rental: Elvis, magician, elf, cartoon character, Cleopatra, you name it. One of the best things about the costumes is the amount and quality of the accessories they include with your look. Want to be a 1920's gangster? SOC will have the suit, the weapon, the bling, the hat, and any other details necessary to give more polish to your look.  They have been dressing showgirls and other entertainers in this town for years. They take great pride in matching the customer with a costume she/he will love. This place is not trying to shove a costume at you. They want you to leave looking and feeling good about your selection. \n\nCOST: The costumes aren't cheap. You will be spending around $100 to rent a costume from Showoff. But you will also be walking away with a unique costume that will be detailed and eye catching.   And you may be renting the costume for a few days.  \n\nHALLOWEEN NOTE: As you can imagine, they are very busy during Halloween. If you want first dibs on the costumes, call and make your appointment early. \n\nOVERALL: Showoff Costumes has got an extensive collection of costumes and attentive customer service.  This place should be at the top of anyone's list looking for a fabulous, detail-oriented, and unique costume."
1,"I'm surprised I don't have a review written for this place. I definitely remember walking in after getting a coupon handed to me while my fiance and I were right outside the theatre. Being the extremely hungry people that we are, we decided to give Axxio Pizza a shot. We had previously already been to Slices, and figured that Axxio probably wasn't going to be all that different. Actually, we were wrong. Not because either of them are better, but because Axxio was just as bad as slices despite having a lot of cool options.\n\nThe have really interesting topping combinations that result in a pizza that looks, sounds, and tastes really good on paper, but in reality the execution is poor. I would much rather prefer traveling to Venezia's to get pizza, or skipping the pizza altogether and getting Chipotle or Yum Yum's if I am at the movies. Sorry, but this slice isn't for me."
4,"We have used AZ concept for our Solar  Hot water and solar system.\n  I have read these reviews and what people forget about is that there are many company's out there selling solar.\n The utility companies are backed up three months or more. When ours was finally installed about 3months ,which we were advised of by solar concept. SR said they were sorry but it takes this long right now. After everything passed that day SR advised would be a minimum of 3wk before it would be turned on, was about 31/2wk This was of no fault of AZ CONCEPTS. They have been great to work with, when I had questions, they answered them for me.\n We are very happy with the SOLAR HEATER AND SOLAR on our home.   The installers that put the solar heater and the panels on our roof were very kind and courteous. You don't see that in workers today"

4,"Stayed at the South Point for the first time and wanted sushi type of food, so my family decided to try it out since it's inside the hotel and the first time we ate here I knew I would come back. Sushi is just so good. Try to catch them on a happy hour time though cause they have a good selection for great prices."
0,"Seemingly popular with the 20-somethings with long lines in the evening, we stopped in BurGR for a late lunch and it seems GR is living on his celebrity, not his cooking or service.  It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.  Don't use the excuse \""it's Vegas, Baby.\""   Ramsay is there to take your money.  I think I'm older and more experienced at decent dining than many of the reviewers for this place.  Note the reviews that say they are fans of Ramsay - doesn't have a thing to do with the food actually served - and I assure you - Ramsay didn't cook these things."
4,"Just like New York!  Great Friendly family service! The food...Ah-mazing!  We wanted to try everything- we settled on the lasagna, baked ziti, and meat ravioli. We also got a side of meatballs and tried a slice of white pizza. All were sooooo yummy- the sauce was perfect! We will be back because there is so much more to enjoy!"

Very beatiful - steel, glass, and building angles that leave you in admiration.  \n\nThe Vdara is a welcome edition to Vegas if your not a big fan of having to wander around a smoky, loud, and bright casino floor in order to get to your room.  The good thing is Aria and Bellagio are across the way if you need your dining, gambling, drinking, lounging fix.  \n\nVdara rooms  are more a studio  than a hotel room - however, i doubt the kitchen area is ever used in any substantive way - maybe for longer stays.\n\nCool technology includes automatic shade/blinds, and buttons to push for 'room service' and 'do not disturb'.  some the the lights i think are automatically set to the time of day.\n\nI did have a little issue with housekeeping - where they didn't do my room, but a quick visit to the main desk got it cleaned pretty past.  Also some of the lights were burned out.  I find that kinda strange.  \n\nNote: They are charging a resort fee of $25 that includes 2 small bottles of water, newspaper at check in desk, internet access, unlimited local calls, and tuck-in service.  I didn't use any of this stuff except for the water.\n\nI imagine this hotel is best suited for the business traveler who doesn't need the many distractions."
0,"1 star is too generous for Morris Costumes. Unfortunately, it's the lowest rating possible to provide a review. Morris Costumes proudly sells and distributes a DISGUSTING skinned and chained dead dog prop. I can't even type out the description of it because it brings me to tears and makes me lose even more faith in humanity. This prop promotes and glorifies animal abuse, and Morris Costumes seems keen to continue to sell it and attempt to profit from it.\n\nPerhaps you may think Morris Costumes is not aware of the vile product being sold by their company. Well, not only are they aware of it, but the President and company representative Scott Smith has responded to numerous individual and media inquiries to state that this product is not offensive and that Morris Costumes will continue to sell this product.\n\nTo you, Mr. Scott Smith, President of Morris Costumes - shame on you for standing behind this and publicly stating that \""...I applaud your efforts but your efforts are being misguided and misdirected at the real root of problems today\"". Well Mr. Smith, YOU are contributing to the exact root of the problem. The problem is continuing to promote a vile product that promotes violence and animal abuse for the sake of a sale. I'm repulsed that you call yourself an animal lover and quote - \""dog lover myself\"" - in your public form-letter statement response to media inquiries. So my efforts and anger is directly targeted and pointed at you personally, as well as your disgrace of a company.\n\nI will happily take my money to another costume manufacturer and place of business, and have personally embarked on a mission to make sure all of my friends and family do the same."
3,"This club is amazing once you get inside... The reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because getting in was so disorganized that it was ridiculous.  Even the bouncers didn't really know how everything was organzied because I saw the head guy pull everyone over and have a meeting right there and talk about how they let people in! Disorganized much? We were standing in the hotel guest line too and it ended up being a jumble of people standing there.\n\nAnyways we ended up waiting 45 minutes because they didn't have a set system of letting people in.  The person that was running the line finally felt sorry for us because we were told that it would take 15-20 minutes.  I would of left if it wasn't for the fact that most of my friends were in there already. (My friend and I had arrived on a late flight) Luckily we didn't have to pay but I think they charge $20 after midnight for ladies and guys pay $20 regardless\n\nOnce you get in though, the club is really nice.  It has a indoor/ outdoor portion which was nice if you needed some fresh air.  Drinks were really expensive but what can you expect from a vegas club.  There were areas where you could sort of sit down if you didn't get bottle service which -ladies - is great if you're wearing crazy heels and need a break.  The dance floor was nice and big so you didn't feel like you were getting smushed!  The crowd was good. A good mix of people a good ratio or girls to guys.  Definitely a place worth checking out."
3,"Great burgers! Way better than some other burger places in tow, in my opinion. Not too greasy, perfect portions and decently priced. They have enough options to get what you want, but not too many to make your decision like seem like you are contemplating adoption. \n\nThere Smash burger is great, and if you add on their Smash fries you will be in heaven! (smash fries - reg fries with rosemary olive oil and garlic) \n\nThey are pretty quick too, so if you have a limited time for lunch this is a good option. They also have some great options for the little ones and a few other things to try other than burgers; veggie burgers and hot dogs."
4,So happy to be able to delicious pies witbout chasing the truck around and its with short leash! Heaven!!!
0,"I thought the food was flavorful and tasty. But Im not sure if it was very healthy because I had major hershey squarts (diarrhea) after. The waitress was really nice, but we felt a bit decieved by her. She offered sauce on the side, without informing us that we were gonna be charged for it. And, once she delivered our food, she disappeared. So when we wanted to order more food and get our drinks refilled, no one came over to help us. We were disappointed. It was a bit pricey for the product/service we received. Never going again."
2,"Just because it's not located in a 4-5 star hotel, doesn't mean it's not a great steakhouse.  The Steakhouse at Camelot is really good.  It's very nice and you definitely get the fine dining experience.  I had my favorite fish, seabass.  Even though it was years ago, I totally remember how good it was.  My husband had the rib eye and it was perfectly cooked and great too.  The service was great.  The waiter was attentive, friendly, and warm.  The ambiance is nice and comfortable too.  Candelight and big, overstuffed booths.  It is a very romantic place as well."
4,"I have to give this place five stars based on our first two visits.  My mom and aunt were in town visiting my 2 year old daughter (I know the score, they weren't here to see me!) and we went there for lunch on Friday.  My mom wanted breakfast but also lunch, so we agreed to return on Saturday morning for breakfast.\n\nFirst off, we got there before the lunch rush and didn't have to wait... so that addresses some of the negative reviews I've read here.   It did get packed just minutes after we sat down.   Our server was wonderful, so that addresses another negative I read (ask for Libby's section).  Our food was FANTASTIC.  We ordered adult grilled cheese (the review was 'best grilled cheese I've ever had'), tempura chicken fingers and corned beef sandwich.  The tempura fingers were really good... but then again I love tempura.  I had the leftover of the corned beef sandwich today, and it was really good.   Not Rascal House in Miami Beach, good.. but good!  My wife said the onion rings she got with her grilled cheese were awesome.\n\nFor breakfast today we again did not have to wait... but it did get a little crowded after we sat down.  I just  had to dig in to their famous red velvet waffle, and it did not disappoint.  When it came out it appeared small to me.  I was thankful my wife ordered the lumberjack breakfast (what I called it, I think it's called \""complete breakfast\"" on the menu) because I figured I'd be eating half of that.  Well, by the time I finished the red velvet waffle, I was done.  Small in stature, large in richness!  Wow, that was a powerful breakfast.  Also ordered were the Belgian waffle with fruit, and the banana nut french toast, which my mom raved over.  We had the same server on Saturday that we had on Friday and she again was great!\n\nAll in all, we had two phenomenal meals at Terrace Cafe.  I've heard from friends that dinner there is not so good.. and that does not surprise me.  Based on the speed of delivery of our meals after ordering, this place specializes in \""quick and very tasty\""."
0,"I will never shop at this Banana Republic again. Went there with my lil'un in tow and the customer service reps did not stop following me around the whole time I was there. I was looking through the sales rack and one of the customer service people would not stop talking to me and wanting to show me more of the expensive stuff even after I told her I was looking for some good sale items. After a bit, I chose to ignore her (i think she was the person in charge there) and she just stood there not 3 feet away from me just staring as if I was going to walk away with all her merchandise or something! This is the second time that I have felt like I was being stalked as a thief at THIS Banana Republic. Never again and oh yeah, corporate will be hearing about this one."
1,"Good effort, but a fail in my mind.  It is definitely WAY too loud in there... if I can't have a conversation while yelling... not a spot for me.  Tried the dumplings, burgers and coconuts... and found the price to be fairly high for mediocre 'street' food.  I think the only thing I would be back for is to pick-up some Beard Papas cream puffs."
2,"Just returned from a much anticipated visit to Pig and Pickle...much to my disappointment I write this in hope that those antiicipating thier own visit heed the warning.Following a long day as a bartender addressing the needs of others I eagerly awaited enjoying some new vittles and a new local place .When arriving I was greeted by a very pleasant and joviall bartender Scott...quite a treat. Ordered the croquet sammie and a glass of vino. Asked for house wine and was informed that a pinot noir was the only option....so noir it was. I texted a friend and informed her I was at P n P and feel free to come over and have a drink/nibble. My friend arrived and was literally not acknowledged for 10 minutes. Scott was no where in site. There was a man who we later found out was one of the owners behind the bar...not friendly...not attentitive ...certainly not a reason to visit. Earlier when he asked how was my food I stated the food was good but the temp was lukewarm and I would prefer hotter.Clearly he was NOT interested in my feedback and opinions as he scurried off and remained aloof and unavailable. Scott returns and we share  our disappointment with him...he is gracious and apologetic.....we press on, When presenting our check the owner bartender informs us that he has given us the industry discount( awesome) until my friend realizes that she has been charged 12$ for whatshe hoped to be a cheap glass of house wine....much to our shegrin the noir was not . All in all here it is....nice location...nice ambiance, food was flavorful, Scott was a consumate pro, the prices food wise were reasonable...they need a more affordable wine selection for  the working class. I am sad ...I had high hopes. I was  not at all impressed with the surly arrogance of the \""owner bartender\"" .He alone,was a deterrent to wanting to return regardless of the food and or drinks. Thumbs down on this experience~ Perhaps wait a minute...let them figure out the error of thier ways and this place maystand a chance-"
4,"Up there with Crave for a classy bar with good, expensive martinis.  Nice, modern lighting, the atmosphere makes me feel fabulous.....who am I kidding, I am fabulous!  There's always a cute boy around to by me a drink, so the prices don't bother me too much.  Their \""one & done\"" drinks knock my socks off.....heed the warning that the name gives....I'm serious.....brings me back to my jungle juice days at house parties.  5 stars!"
3,"The music is too loud.\n\nSorry, had to get that out of the way. I've been to MTO twice during my lunch breaks from work since it is so nicely close to my place of employment. It is certainly a nice place, with a vibrant color scheme and fun TV screens that display cute sayings and funny pictures. \n\nFood is scrumptious and varies between fatty and healthy. You can find a mix of ingredients, interesting and quirky, while also on the menu, you have traditional items to please the crowds. \n\nLast time I was here I had the FAT ELVIS. I couldn't help myself, french toast with bacon, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, and nutella, served with maple syrup. COME ON, even if you don't want it, you have to be interested, right? It was a heaping portion, for $13 and I only ate half. The mix of flavors is decent, french toast was done right, fluffy, not mushy, nice char on the bread, but not over-powering. Bread used it perfect, big and much like Texas toast style. Fruits were fresh and helpful since the meal is so very filling. Peanut-butter and Nutella flavors go well with the banana, but not so much the bacon in my opinion. I would opt to have the bacon on the side. \n\nI've also had the Hen House wrap here, and I believe it's better than the Fat Elvis. Wrap was not mushy or dry. Lettuce was crispy and fresh. Chicken was grilled well and honestly, probably one of the better wraps I've had in my existence of eating wraps. And I don't regularly consume them. Coffee is also good and comes in a nice, large cup.\n\nBonus - they have PINK lemonade on their menu. Yes, I ordered it. Yes, it was good. \n\nOverall return factor very likely. Recommended for breakfast and lunch."
3,"This artsy and fun bistro in the Plateau neighborhood is clearly popular with locals at brunch, and it features a French-only menu. It was one of my more memorable dining experiences in Montreal. The brunch menu consists of typical omelets, french toast, and breakfast foods, but the specialty of the house is the eggs benedict. I'm normally not a fan of the runny Benedict, but I did enjoy the chorizo benedict a great deal. The atmosphere is artsy and hipster, and the crowd tended towards the same. The music was great. It was a great meal and a fun place to people watch. We arrived around 1 pm and had no wait or line.\n\nThe bathroom was awesome. If you miss it, you will be \""blue\"".\n\nOne area for improvement for this restaurant is the service. We were seated quickly, but then left for at least 7-10 minutes without any menu or assistance. When we requested something, the waiter would disappear for long periods. I realize that we Americans tend to get into a rush at restaurants, but the service bordered on the neglectful. If I have to hunt down a server to request a menu, something needs to be addressed in terms of attitudes or staffing. Once we had the food, I was delighted."
3,"Heard and read about this place a lot before I finally got the chance to pop in. Came last week during my lunch break and my only complaint was not being able to indulge in happy hour and try any of the cocktails (don't think the boss would approve). So I settled for the Caprese Grilled Cheese with a side of Sweet Potato Fries and the waitress so kindly made me an iced chai latte though it was listed as a hot drink only.\n\nEverything was TASTY and the menu is huge. There are so many options to choose from - this is definitely one of those places you have to visit multiple times to not only try breakfast, lunch, AND dinner, but all the different dishes they offer for EACH of those courses. \n\nAs Arnold would say, I'll be bach.*\n\n\n\n\n*Austrian pronunciation for \""back.\"""
0,"woke up late and i really want a quick breakfast and got a really bad service and equally lousy food at nathan's in the las vegas strip food court.  i have to say \""i want 2 waffles\"" 4 times before the bilingual server got my order correctly. my coffee didn't show up on my tray, and the bilingual cashier told me she didn't get the coffee order. in my frustration i  went to starbucks accross the stall to get my fix instead of reordering nathan's coffee. the food is equally bad. the waffle is soggy, the bacon is hard, and the biscuit didn't come with butter or jam. i should have gone to mcdonald's, 2 stalls away for half the price."
1,"Looks like no one else had my experience.. My mom walked out as miserable as I did, but the friend we took had a great experience. \n\nAs far as massages go, I've had 2: one here, and one at the Hale Koa in Hawaii. My massage at the Hale Koa was in a whole different ball park- like the most amazing experience ever. All the Wynn has are the amazing facilities. You can spend the whole day in there if you like. My actual massage was TERRIBLE. I had a nice enough African American man, and he pinched my skin and left me feeling bruised. This is super unusual for me, as I like my massages rough. It felt like he wasn't massaging muscle, just pinching skin and fat. I'm not a fat person, I was your typical 22 year old, size 7.. so it's not like he couldn't get to my muscles."
3,"At the time of the original order, I was charged for some services that were expected to be done.  It turned out some parts I paid for didn't have to be used after all.  When I called Blake about this,  he handled the refund over the phone with no problems. Based on his earlier service, this was what I expected from him.  Good to be able to say this about Blake!"
0,"I took my daughter here for her 21st birthday and what a mistake I made!!! We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.\n\nI stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. \n\nThis tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio \""All Suites\"" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other \""Strip\"" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there \""Ghetto\"" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. \n\nSince my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it. \n\nBUYERS BEWARE!!!!"
3,"Cupcake Heaven!!  Well... only because I haven't physically been to Yummy Cupcakes in LA - so a direct comparison is still pending.  So, a 5-star update may be in the future.\n\nHere at Mad Hatter you can actually custom build your own 4 layer cupcakes! ... Observe\n\nFirst, you start off with the type of cake.  Choose from flavors such as classic chocolate, vanilla bean, red velvet and several others.\n\nThen you choose what type of oooey-gooey filling you want in it.   Chocolate Ganache, White chocolate Ganace, Banana creme, Orange creme, etc etc etc ,there are literally over a dozen choices.\n\nNext comes the topping ... More Chocolate?  More Vanilla? More White Chocolate? Cream Chees perhaps? Ahhhhhh the Choices !!\n\nWhat??? One more choice??!?. Pick a Topper!  A Bite Sized Butterfinger? Baby Ruth? Snickers? Kit Kat? Twix? Chocolate chip cookie?  A C-3PO HEAD??! yes, you can so choose that if you wish.\n\nCupcakes are $3.25each and can also be bought in Half Dozens($19.50) and Dozens($36.00).\n\nConveniently located just a stone's throw away from Cupcake Lane at the Target Plaza on Ft Apache/215, so we were able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAt Mad Hatter, I went for the Red Velvet, with Orange Creme filling and White Chocolate creme topping\n\nI Then went next door to Cupcake lane for their Red Velvet with cream cheese topping.....sadly, it was no contest.   Mad Hatter wins that comparison, hands-down.  Maybe it's not a fair comparison... after all, I custom made the cupcake at Mad Hatter. \n\nBut, no worries.  There will be further direct comparisons in the future"
0,"Well, I would leave a post, but all of the posts saying it was DISGUSTING, ARE DEAD ON!!!  DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!  You can expect filth, leading ceilings, LOUD BAND UNTIL 3 AM, FILTH, I did say FILTH RIGHT????  They will lie and tell you their rooms are updated, NO only a few of them have been.  Stained and dirty floors, walls, the whole room!  The hotel elevator had a hole in the wall covered by a bare piece of THIN plywood!!!  READ ALL BAD REVIEWS AND TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY!!!  Look at all pictures and BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE!!!!  DON'T STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Seriously?\n\nThey have a website.\n\nTheir website does not have their phone number.\nTheir website does not have their address.\nTheir website does not have a map.\n\nI'd be tempted to wonder why, but I suppose if that's an indication of their attention to detail I should just take the hint."
3,"Delightful meal and service. I got the smoked salmon crepe (healthy!) for dinner and the Jamaican crepe for dessert (decadent!). Oh, and the French Onion Soup was deliciously cheesy. Our waiter was fun and friendly."
2,"Like most women, I'm a fan of Target. If the store brand were a band that went on tour, I'd be right up with the rest of them, throwing my panties on stage.\n\nBut this location is a little odd. It's right across from Koreatown and when we went around 4PM there were literally seventeen cars in the parking lot. So if you want to avoid a crowd, this might be the one to go to.\n\nHowever, what is missing in customers is also missing in staff and selection. Store layout is a little odd, and the first thing you see when you walk in is the little food court area- which zero people went to while we were there. The store also lacks a produce department- they would probably increase their customers if they replaced the snack stand with a fresh produce area. But that's my completely unprofessional opinion.\n\nUsually I can spend my weight in cash on the women's fashion department, but here nothing was styled or really on display and nothing caught my eye- a rarity for Target stores.\n\nFound the basic items we needed, at prices we expect for this chain, but was just underwhelmed. Other reviews say this location feels vaguely dirty, and I see what they mean but I can't put my finger on why- it's not physically dirty, but the lighting seems a little dim and the store itself just isn't as cheerful as other locations.\n\nService was okay- we were stuck in line behind a couple who racked up a $200+ bill but couldn't seem to figure out which combination of credit cards and cash would cover their purchases. Cashier graciously offered to have us check out ahead of them while previous customers got their payment together, but we declined. Throughout our visit, saw staff cleaning and reorganizing, and when we couldn't find specific items they were quick to tell us where to find them."
1,"Dawn P is on the right track\n\nService is great!\n\nAs for the food...\n\nWe tried the carnivore pizza - just a notch above frozen pizza\n\nIced tea tastes like water, and the bar tender agreed, but could not fix the mix. She graciously offered an alternative.\n\n\nWe will give em another try in a month or to."
2,"I only come here for xiao long bao which is the soup dumplings, but I also usually get the pan friend shanghai dumplings and beef roll. Rarely do I venture outside of that here. \n\nThe foods good, I haven't found a place with better xiao long baos in Vegas, however the service is alright and some times you'll get someone who barely speaks or understands English. It hasn't detoured me yet though."
0,"Sorry PAM (owner) but your place was terrible!!! My daughter had a so called cheese omelet (tiny tiny tiny tiny), it looked like something I was served on an airplane. The omelet consisted of one egg, maybe just maybe two very small eggs, paper thin deli ham (2 slices) little bit of finely shredded cheese, no toast, and a small side of dried out potatoes BTW the omelet was served on a plastic plate. To add insult they charged $7.95 for this. I had a egg and bacon breakfast burrito again very small, it was OK. Having read some of the other reviews me thinks that they are a sham by friends and relatives. This place is the worst!!!!"
0,"This is absolutely the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my entire life.  From the moment that I stepped into the door, I was greeted by nothing but the cold shoulder and the tapping of text messages being sent.  Words to the owner about surviving in retail, the business is all about how you treat the people who walk in."
0,"Dr's here are terrific if you ever can get an appointment to see one.\n \nOffice is beautiful inside. But they probably should have invested the $$ in upgrading the office functionality.\n \nPhone system in not user friendly..all robots and slim chance of getting human to ever answer phone.  Then she redirects u 2 voicemail even if it's within operational hours. U better be dying, hemorrhaging or in labor right now they just transfer u back into the voicemail system.\n \nPosted hours  do not reflect actual hours of operation.\n \nNeed yr records sent to you or another Dr? Great! This office is trapped in the 80's and not technology friendly. To convey information and records the use fax, snail mail, and probably last owners of a typewriter. Unfortunately, making their turn around time REALLY slow. Online.. What's that? The whole office doesn't even have one email address.\n\nGreat Dr's if u ever get an appointment. 2 month waiting period average."
1,"Ambiance: 5 stars (for a Vietnamese restaurant, that is, not a steak house)\nFood: 1.5 stars \nService: 2.5 stars\n\nSo after hearing how great this place was from a friend, I finally tried it out, and was shocked.  The food was not tasty - I think it was the chicken in the Pho that tasted bad.  The rest was just bland.  Never been back."
3,"Cheap, cheap eats! Really great breakfast and service. The bloody mary was delish and for only $5, it packed a wallop for the small glass."
4,"Thank you yelpers for recommending this place!  Had a cheeseburger with Havarti and corn on the cob. I said \""yum!\"" After every bite!  Perfect sized burger, especially the meat to bun ratio!  It was just as satisfying watching other newbies having their first bites!  The employees were also super nice and proud of their product!"
3,"Burgers have taken on a highfalutin, gourmet attitude, but there are still a few places that make just a regular hamburger, albeit some with hole-in-the-wall status. Open since 1965, The Original Wineburger in Phoenix hits high marks when it comes dive hangouts, but most of all, they make one killer burger.\n\nWalking into Wineburger, you'll feel as if you've been transported to another place and time, and this is a good thing. Surrounded by wood paneling, Formica-topped tables and the glow of neon beer signs, the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed. Diners seat themselves in either the main bar area or the game area.\n\nA burger joint doesn't bring visions of healthy light snack and salads; let's face it, you're here to eat thick slabs of meat and fried accompaniments. So it's no surprise the menu is full of fried delights, like the tasty Mini Corn Dogs ($4.75), finger-sized corn dogs that were fresh and hot.\n\nI also enjoyed the Cheddar Pints ($5), battered cheese curds deep fried to a golden brown perfection, a Wisconsin favorite.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, the Original Wineburger's fanciest ingredient is a splash of sangria to help enhance the beef's natural flavor and juiciness. The Original Wineburger ($5.75), one-third pound of certified Angus Beef, was cooked perfectly medium and oozing with cheddar cheese. Each juicy bite was hinted with wine, which gave the burger a slightly sweet edge.\n\nThe Super Wineburger ($8.75) is a two-third pound version of the original, though after a few bites I realized that they forgot to use wine on this one. The bacon I added to my burger provided a fair amount of porky smokiness.\n\nWhat's a tasty burger without a tasty beer? Complimenting the salty beefiness, Moose Drool Brown Ale ($3.50) was ice cold and had a sweet malty flavor. Surprisingly light for a brown ale, it was a pleasure drinking. While the Trout Slayer Filtered Wheat Beer ($3.50) was slightly bitter at first, it mellowed into a sweet smoothness that sort of reminded me of an apple.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, simplicity is king -- it's still just two pieces of bread and a ground meat patty."
4,"My experience going here has always been excellent. The people are nice. I've never had any issues and the staff members are genuinely interested in my welfare as a client. I've only had one instance where they needed to reschedule my appointment, but they squeezed me in within a week. I don't have any complaints about the people or service here and I've been going to this location for over a year."
1,All I have to say is... You had a nice run but it's time to quite.  I go about once a year and each year they go down hill a little more.  I don't think I'll go back.
0,"I should have listened to the reviews on here, but thinking they might have cleaned up a bit after receiving so many negatives, I thought I'll give it a shot! Big mistake.\n\nTrust me, I lived in 5 countries this far and have been to many many nail places this far. \nI have NEVER come across something like this.\n\nThe acrylic nails looked absolutely horrifying, even though it was just a fill! The shape was terrible. The place I went to fix them after had to file down on them another 40 minutes to make them look nice again!\nOn top of it they were extremely rude.\n\nI tried to explain to the nail artist how I would like to have them shaped (like I always do without problems), and he simply said no, he can't do that! \nIncredible, considering I've had them done that way at countless places before.\nAt that point I told him to please stop, since I will have to fix them elsewhere anyways and he just kept on working away, after repeated requests to please stop.\n\nHe did not apply a nail color, and despite not being finished and it looking really bad, they asked me to pay the full price for the set. I was absolutely ready to pay part of it, but why should I pay full price for an undone job, being unsatisfied and an incredibly rude staff?\nThey insisted and almost called the police.\n\nI just paid with my card and charged back the whole amount!\n\nPlease don't ever be afraid to charge back for services that are completed this badly or people that treat you wrong.\n\nI've been to places before, where the nails did not turn out AS good as usually, but I know the technician tried their best and was very sweet and helpful about it. I know they tried, they were just not at that level of expertise or had a different idea of looks etc. I never complained in that case, but just paid and went to a different place next time.\nBut this place was nothing like that! Just plain terrible and disrespectful.\n\nHope this review helps the next person not to commit my mistake!"
2,"First, if adorable toenails are important to you this is the place to go.  They have TONS of designs to choose from (I don't just mean a flower on the toe) you can have plaid, polka dots, seasonal designs, everything!  I always get lots of compliments on my toes and I have never gotten the same design twice.\nThe salon itself is nothing fancy.  I guess it's what to be expected from a nail place by Home Depot.  Also, don't bother calling ahead for an appointment -- I swear they don't write them down and just take people as they come in the door.  \nPrices are reasonable.  Heads up, you can pay with debit/credit but the want cash tips and always roll their eyes if you try to tip on the card."
4,"Was there on labor day weekend and it was a great experience. Even when the place wa packed we got sit right away and the food was delicious: I ordered a pizza and it was awesome, My son ordered the meatloaf and that thing was finger-licking good, my daugther oredered pasta and that thig was home made and extra good. My wife ordered the sliders and that was also awesome. To top it all the service was great! love the place and we will be back!"
4,I can't wait to try everything on this menu.  We got smothered burritos that are massive and you have a choice of red mild or hot and green mild.  The red hot is great.  We had a colifornia and a regular carne adasa - the meat was tender and flavorful.  The only other thing we got was a fish taco to try it - it was also huge and so delicious - with a lot of fresh guac on top.  They have a huge selection and I really hope they do well - the food speaks for it's self.
2,"RA seemed like a legit sushi restaurant while we were sitting in our hotel room, craving sushi. We opted to wait a bit and head over to catch their reverse happy hour (10 pm-close). The interior is nicely dimmed and has a cozy feeling. There was a good vibe in there and thank god it was not noisy and hectic. Getting away from the crazy loud Vegas life to enjoy a meal was refreshing.\n\nOrdered off the happy hour menu. Wasn't too impressed with what I saw on there so I figured I'll go with what I know and keep it decent. From what I saw around my table, rolls were slightly small, my rainbow roll was just okay. The albacore was probably the best dish I sampled. Honestly, nothing was too memorable for me and same goes for my friends.\n\nOn  a good note... service was phenomenal, even hooked me up with a sake on the house. BUT, their idea of a large sake, is weaaaaaakkk. That's a small ass bottle my friend. A quiet, chill, not too stuffed but sorta buzzed evening gives my experience at RA a solid 3 stars."
4,"Okay Radio Milano, I have a confession to make.  I have secretly and unfairly harbored borderline hatred in my heart for you since you overtook the space that once held my favorite Italian restaurant, Pronto's.  I know hate is a strong word, but that is truly how I felt for almost two years.  However, that all changed, last Saturday night.  Radio Milano, can you ever forgive me?\n\nYou know how you secretly spy on an ex after you break up, just to see what they're up to so you don't get blindsided one day by showing up at the same place.  You know the scenario, you're alone and they are there... looking as fabulous as ever... with their new someone...who also looks as fabulous as ever and the situation is more than...awkward?  Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I've been following @radioMILANO on twitter for awhile now, silently cursing them every time they posted some wonderful looking creation from their kitchen that just made my mouth water.  Yes, I still miss Pronto's.  So after I saw their Saturday Chalkboard Surf and Turf Special, I decided to be the bigger person, put on a happy face, and confront my inner demon.  It took me two weeks to work up the courage (actually, we had prior commitments for 2 weekends), but finally, we made it!  And am I glad we did!\n\nFirst let me say, that once inside, I was completely shocked at the renovation that had taken place.  I did not recognize the space at all, save the arched ceilings.  The ambiance is amazing.  I totally felt like a hipster in an old school Rat Pack flick.  The place just wreaked, \""Coolness\""!  We were promptly seated upon our arrival. We ordered our drinks; I had a glass of wine, my wife had a mixed drink (something pink) that resembled a cosmo, but made with pomegranate juice.  We looked over the menu, even though we were there for the special and found many things we would have otherwise enjoyed, had we not been there for the surf and turf.\n\nWe started with an order of the deviled eggs.  Can I just say that these were THE BEST deviled eggs I've ever had?  The consistency of the yolk was more of an egg salad, and the flavors were incredible.  We just finished with our appetizer when our main course arrived.  The presentation was excellent!  The petite lobster tail was cooked to perfection, as was the petite filet!  The steamed broccoli was not overdone and the mashed potatoes were amazing!  Unfortunately, we didn't get to sample the dessert menu because we were both stuffed!\n\nIt was a pleasure to meet the person behind the @radioMILANO twitter account.  He's a very nice guy.  Yes, I remember his name, but since he doesn't have it posted on his twitter account, I won't post it here.  We really enjoyed our night out at Radio Milano and can't wait to return.  So...Am I forgiven yet?"
1,"Ok...I was so excited to try this place, seeing that I'm a fan of Man v. Food...so when I went to Las Vegas for my brother's bachelor party, we had to stop in and give it a try.  \n\nSo...upon arriving, the host said it would take about 35 min...but it took over an hour for them to seat us, even after asking him 4 times what was taking so long.  Not good.\n\nFinally we got to our seats, and I already knew what to order, since I did some research before going.  I ordered the Andy's Sage Chicken Benedict.  I think almost all of our group ordered it too.  The waiter even said that was his favorite thing, and that we all made a great choice.\n\nIt took a long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it looked amazing.  Almost like a piece of art.  We've all seen the pics.  The only problem is IT HAD NO FLAVOR!!!!!!  Everything tasted the same...the chicken tasted like the eggs, the biscuit tasted like the chipotle sauce...there was no flavor at all...I'm a big guy who loves his food, but I probably had 4 bites before I just gave up hoping that the next bite was going to make it all better...it just wasn't gonna happen.\n\nSo...maybe I was just overhyping it in my own mind...or it just really wasn't that good...or maybe I just went on a bad day...but it really wasn't good...I wouldn't waste my time if I were you..."
2,"Ok uhm Did they just get Coyote Ugly? Because when they first opened, they were semi cute. It was a big publicity stunt open audition in Downtown. Unfortunately this place isn't the easiest place to find if you don't know what you're looking for. Yea I'm pretty sure the NYC one is closed. This one....LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. Plus there's gaming. Plus they don't market correctly. Yea so this is kinda a biker bar that plays a lot of rockabilly and country. \nThe bartenders do tell you to go \""f*ck yourself\"" if you're a guy....They're very prowomen - Most of the yelling through the megaphone sounds like an angry McDonald's worker. I just want a drink...Ok so this one time I ordered 2 drinks. The bartender messed it up and she threw the glass. Yea she was pretty drunk. Couldn't handle her own. She doesn't work there anymore. She was kinda cute in her drunk way. I mean I know if she passed out, she'd let me hit it. Yea....Anyway it's an \""experience\"". It's not the busiest bar. But I think they need to do a few changes before I can even rate this bar right."
2,Great service at the Drive Thru...
4,"So my layover in Phoenix was three hours long (turned into six but that's a whole 'nother story...) Anyways, my cousin goes to ASU, so I called her up and had her get me for breakfast since I had a ton of time to kill.\n\nShe takes me to this little tiny place called Over Easy. Yay, it looks cute. It also looks like (by looking at the building) it used to be a Taco Bell back in the day. Ah oh!\n\nWHO KNEW THERE WAS GOOD FOOD IN ARIZONA!? I actually liked the 'Over Easy' entree that I got. Filled me up and while it wasn't gourmet or anything, it was the next best thing. Also, it's helpful to mention that there is nothing on the menu over 10.00 - nothing. All you ASU kids should eat here.\n\nFinally, the crappy thing about running a business in the middle of an Arizona desert is that you're sometimes gonna get some Arizona desert clientele. Let me just say that the service is amazing. EVEN THOUGH there were some genuine straight from the trailer park douchebags in there. Had to say it. I love you Over Easy."
3,"Our recent dinner at  Zinc Bistro was excellent. The food seemed better than we remembered from previous experience and so did the service. Also, because we were seated in front, the noise wasn't as deafening as it can be there. It didn't hurt that we ate early and that the restaurant wasn't overly crowded at that time. We were pleasantly surprised and will go there again."
2,"hmmm i have rather mixed feelings about this place.  i love the brass monkey in leith!  it's a fabulous bar that is literally a five minute walk from my flat and has an awesome pub quiz on monday nights.  but the cellar monkey, which is the newest offer from the brass monkey people left me wanting for something more....\n\nsaturday night, i went along with a group of friends for some birthday drinks.  when we arrived the bar was empty save two people that were meeting us there.  this was saturday night at 8pm.... in a bar that is surrounded by student flats and has comfy sofas to sit on while having a drink.  i found this emptiness odd, given the area and the night and felt that the bar lacked an atmosphere.  more people did eventually come in, but save for the group of guys that sat in the corner the rest were there for the birthday drinks.  so either this bar isn't overly popular (which would be sad) or people don't really know about it.\n\nit would make me sad if this bar wasn't popular as it's such a lovely cosy wee spot that should be ideal for those students or non students living nearby.  there was loads of seating, most of it in big sofas or comfy arm chairs that gave the bar a bit of a living sort of vibe.  also plently of drinks on offer at a reasonable price with friendly bar staff.  so maybe this place is still bedding in as it's not long since it opened.  i'm hoping this is the case as the bar has great potential and it would be terribly sad to see it close due to lack of customers!"
0,"Sometimes there really needs to be a \""no star\"" option. Or maybe a \""it was so bad they owe me some damn stars\"" choice. But there isn't so I'll go with a one-star review and I'll add a caveat of \""how shitty do you want to be treated?\""\n\nIt's time for Jim to get a new company car. We're excited about this because we tire of driving around in a gas-hog. And Jim is particularly optimistic about a new car because they put a jeep on the list. Now granted, it's not the rubicon of his dreams but it is a \""better mileage\"" jeep and that's a start.\n\nSo we went over to Superstition Springs Jeep because they had a number of the specific model on the lot. He wanted to test drive all the choices and decide which car to order.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by four salesmen. Jim told them why we were there. As soon as they realized his was to be a fleet purchase they blew us off. They pointed at a group of cars and went under a tree to smoke. We did take a look, not really believing that they actually blew us off like that, but of course all but a couple base models were locked up tight.\n\nWe went inside, still hoping to pull this time-waster out of the craper, and Jim went over to the sales manager. He explained what we wanted and what we'd experienced so far. He made clear that being blown off was unacceptable. The manager mumbled something mildly apologetic and walked off. Jim went in search of a fleet person. \n\nWhen the manager came back he asked me for the name of my husband's company. I told him and he responded that fleet orders go directly to the factory. The implication was that we couldn't expect anyone to help us because there was nothing in it for them.\n\nI told the manager that I considered it a mistake because you never know who you're dealing with. I told him that I might be in the market for a new car in six or eight months (which is true if certain events come to pass) and that I certainly wouldn't buy it anyplace that I was treated so rudely.\n\nThe manager looked at me and told me that if that's the way I felt I should go find another dealership to test drive a jeep.\n\nLet me repeat that, just in case you missed it. We were treated rudely and when we objected we were told to leave. \n\nI think the manager was hoping to intimidate me. At least it seemed that way from the way he towered over me, hands on hips, scowling. But I looked at him, smiled and told him he was absolutely right. I called to Jim, told him what the manager said, and we left.\n\nI have to say I am impressed by a company whose commission-only business philosophy involves alienating your customer. Especially since Jim's good sized fleet has to be serviced somewhere and the service department generates a huge amount of the dealership income.\n\nSuffice it to say we were treated much better elsewhere. We won't be back."
4,"I love the atmosphere of their space! It looks upscale, feels cozy, and delivers some tasty juice. \n\nI had a Beet Ginger juice-- the ingredients tasted fresh and I loved the thick consistency. My friend had a ginger lime juice, and I found it to be too watery.\n\nThe Master Juicer of the day came out and had us test a super fresh ginger, green apple punch in the mouth. It was the most perfect shot of juice to bring you to your senses or possibly even out of a coma. I'll be waiting to see that on the menu so I can give up coffee for good."
4,2 following Meals TO GO were made perfect.  The  Triple Beef Taco is so good that I just told a Visiting Co-Worker that they had to get one before he returned to Michigan.
1,"Their AZ burrito was great. The flavor journey ended way too soon though. The portion size was disappointing, very small. The salsa included was not very authentic, not good. Service was mediocre, lacking professionalism, what do you expect near ASU though? I would probably not go back again as it was also expensive! :/"
1,"This is a medium sized all you can eat sushi and Asian food buffet.  We went during \""Happy Hour\"" where the price is only $11.95 per adult.  Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\n\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\n\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.  It's been years since I had to worry about this food additive.  Although my headache was not bad, I don't need this experience again.  Go only if MSG doesn't bother you."
3,"Yes, Julia T's review may be boring.  But, it didn't stop me from heading over to someburros.  Good thing!  She was spot on!  \n\nNothing more I can say above what J said... Take a look at her review!"
3,"This place is pretty decent. It's attached to the back of a Korean grocery store, which makes it pretty interesting.  The only problem I have with it is the small portion and relatively high pricing when compared to other Korean eateries in town. The food is good though. I've had the Kalbi, and the Jang Bong Noodles. The Kalbi is pretty good, but it really wasn't enough food for 2 even though the menu says it was for 2. The Jang Bong noodles were ok. They didn't put any shrimp in it though. It's supposed to be a seafood noodle, I've always had Jang Bong with shrimp in it. Due to the pricing and the portions,  I probably just eat at G-mart from now on instead."
3,"Victoria Street is one of the best streets in Edinburgh for shopping individuality and general quirkiness. Swish fits in well amongst the mix of boutiques and random outlets, and specialises in retro bags and t-shirts for men and women, although there is a really sweet section at the front with a lot of cute garments, which are mostly on the girly side.\n\nMessenger bags in different designs, Gola bags in a ton of colours, plus some girlier handbags in some very funky, patterned designs. There are also various jazzed up laptop covers, other little items scattered around to give as gifts, and my personal favourite, the t-shirts. The t-shirt designs in here are very cool, and just that little bit different."
4,"Marrow and crispy Brussels are a meal in themselves, and we almost canceled the burgers.  Wow, that wouldve been a mistake!  I luckily found my 2nd stomach... mussels were also good.   gin Richard, and  crimson tide were both really nice cocktails!"
4,"I loved Kokomo! I have yet to go to a fro yo store as clean as Kokomo! The fruits were so fresh, and the topping section was clean, with a great variety! I also found it charming that I got to meet with the friendly owners! Kokomo beats all the yogurt store in this area!  I didn't feel guilty because the yogurt is so healthy! I highly recommend Kokomo!"
3,"Excellent place for japanese style noodles!  Finally, a place in AZ with a good selection of japanese dishes.  I've tried several of their Ramen, Udon, and Soba soups and they are all very good.  The best I've had in AZ.  I am also a fan of their japansese style curry rice."
0,"I went here for a coworker's birthday and was highly disappointed. The other reviews on the restaurant were great so my expectations were a little high. The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic with the spectacular views but the food and service left much to be desired. I work in the service industry so tend to be a little less critical but I was incredibly disappointed in Binions. \n\nWhile our group was sitting down, one member (who happened to be visiting from another country) stood next to the window to take pictures and our server hovered over our table trying to take drink orders. He was clearly annoyed because she wasn't paying attention and he had to wait. We were there around 8:30 and there were maybe 3 other couples in the restaurant so it's not like he was that busy...I don't quite understand why he didn't step away and give us a few minutes to settle in before taking drink orders.\n\nNow on to the food...I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for the steak but the seafood was awful. I'm from Seattle so have a taste for good, fresh fish and this restaurant did not have it. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and when the plate was set down in front of me, the first thing I saw was two slabs of gray meat. I kid you not, it looked like liver. Unfortunately for me it tasted as bad as it looked: dry and bland. And the sauce they chose? Yeah...it did not compliment it at all. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but didn't hold a candle to The Keg's. \n\nMaybe it was an off night for Binion's but this was my first impression and with that being said, I'll never go back. The way I see it, they should treat every customer's experience like it's their first and \""wow\"" them so they'll come back. Unfortunately, I was not \""wow'd\"" and don't plan on visiting Binon's again."
3,"When you think of ramen you would think Cup 'O' noodles but after coming here for the first time I will never think of ramen the same way again. The place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what I've heard from people that have been to Japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. The first time I visited Monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. I also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.\n\nThe food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the pork belly bowl all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. I've tried both the Shoyu and the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. In both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. So if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. The noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. The texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.\n\nI guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited Monta. So if your looking for a quick bite and want quality Japanese ramen come check out Monta it will make you say \""cup 'o' what???\"""
2,"Review for the Lounge/Club:\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \n\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \n\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \n\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \n\nFor the Restaurant:\n\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price."
2,"This place will become the next Hooters.  In fact I have a friend who calls this place \""Celtic Hooters\"".  The first week it is open and it is packed.  In fact it is always busy, which makes for a fun experience.  The servers are in the magical 19-20 age range (old enough to serve, not quite old enough to drink) range.  Pretty girls, who will make small talk with business men.  As a female, getting service here is a bit tougher. I would advise going straight to the bar.  The food is standard pub fare, they have a good beer collection along with ciders.  Overall, you come here with a group of friends, lots of televisions.  Good place for a basic HH with friends you want to see but not actually talk to (it is pretty noisy in there), and face it, the pretty girls in reallly really small outfits are distracting, (and I'm a girl).  There are lots of servers, but like I mentioned, the girls really chat up the patrons, so you may or may not get speedy service."
3,"Who can abstain from visiting Panda Express every now and again?  Most people, but not me.  I need my Chinese food fix every few weeks.  And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don't seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.  Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital \""s\"", \""u\"", \""c\"", \""k\"", \""s\"".  Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn't love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner."
0,"Worst place ever in charlotte. I order the sweet 18 roll, and 4 others... They were all not good. For some reason it was hard to finish the food, maybe it was the overload of msg in their sauces. I don't mind msg in food but when a restaurant puts too much in it gets hard to eat. The couple sitting near us had a really pissed look on their face, had three bites, paid and left. I should have taken a picture as proof but I was too angry with the food to think straight."
4,"I actually look forward to my visits!!!! No lie!  Amazing staff, very friendly and caring....almost like being at happy hour with friends without the alcohol.  Lol That's my only suggestion... Serve martinis with a cleaning.   My teeth always feel super clean after my visit.  Honest business people.  Best I have ever been to."
1,Not very funny .He is a Nice guy but Not funny  hes better than Gordy Brown ..Gordy Brown a time share pitch im sure is better .....
1,"My husband decided to surprise me with flowers the day before Valentine's Day, so he stopped at McDonald on the way home from the office.  The flower arrangement itself was beautiful, however within two days the flowers started to die.  We contacted the shop and they told us we would need to bring the flowers back in order to replace them (there was no guarantee that they would be replaced)\n\nIn the past we have ordered flowers from Cactus Flowers, a similar situation came about and without any questions asked Cactus Flowers delivered a new arrangement.  We will not be shopping at McDonald again, instead Cactus has our business for life."
2,"Just got here, still very busy. Our booth still very wet from being cleaned, both seats and table. When hostess was informed, instead of just wiping it down she began to justify the condition by stating it was clean. Had to wait for drink orders. Not impressed with Svc thus far. Martini seemed to lack alcohol & it's $10. Had to wait fairly long for food. When it arrived it was hot and very tasty. Kudos for flavor except for sauteed spinach; garlic overload. My burger while very good was overdone. Our server who was very pleasant comped the burger when he discovered it was not as I ordered. He did so without me requesting it. I will go back, but service really needs to consider the customer more."
3,Im now in my mid 20's and figured it was time to find a family doctor just to make sure I  was healthy. After searching and searing(which is a drag) a friend of mine who works for Dr. Donna Miller(hear nothing but good things about this woman even though she is not my OBGYN) suggested I see someone from Nevada Family Care. At first I wanted to see Dr Karl but he was so popular apparently it was almost impossible to see him. I decided to go for Dr Fakhouri but he wasnt able to see me as scheduled. Because i was determined to see a doctor I went with Dr Barettoko and let me tell you am I HAPPY she was who I ended up with. Her bedside manner was outstanding. I havent seen a doctor in ages so I was a little nervous and boy did she make me feel comfortable! She was so nice and attentive to all my questions! I would suggest anyone to see her!! I wanted to rate this 5 stars but because of the run around to get an appointment and i thinking the office could use a little update i went with 4 stars.  But Dr Barettoko is deff worth more than 4 stars!
3,Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!
4,"Delicious cappuccinos (try the mocha, yum) in a nice little quiet atmospheric shop and wonderful friendly service. Definitely a nice place to sit and sip and read the paper or people watch out the window. Just a bit hidden but definitely worth finding. Had a tasty fresh chocolate croissant as well, be sure to check out the array of muffins!"
3,"Super kid friendly, for kids under about 7 years old.  The only bad thing is that in the summer time, it gets outrageously hot and there's no where to get A/C protection... but I suppose welcome to Phoenix in the summertime."
3,"Been coming here since it's opened and I'm still impressed with the consistency and friendly atmosphere.  Our bartender Lori is always smiling and never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge of cocktail concoctions and ability to make them great.  The food always taste well prepared and fresh, never been disappointed."
3,"If you want Vintage, this is were you go.  I am vintage hound and this place sparked a interest with me.  They have decent men's selection which a lot of trendy store seem to be lacking. \n\nThe coat section is pretty awesome.  Vintage leather, Suede, corduroy, you name they had it on the rack.   The had some good sizing too, I am a skinny lanky dude.\n\nEverything is well laid out and organized well.   The prices are high, but you can get some great 1 off vintage items here.  I am still hope to get a \""leather sweater\"" in my size there."
0,"what the F*** is that smell. Have they ever cleaned this place?? \n\nDrink specials? who cares, If I gave you a free beer with dog crap rubbed all over the sides would you drink it?"
4,"Holy mother of Pearl! Where have you been all my life, True Rest?\n\nI was taken here by a friend as \""payment\"" for house sitting for him a few weeks ago. Honestly, I thought the whole idea of floating in a saltwater bath was pretty hokey (this guy tends to be a little out there, if you're catching what I'm throwing) so I didn't expect to have a life-altering experience. Much to my surprise, I was completely amazed. After an orientation, completing a form (which included a notice of a $500 fee if you defecated in the water!) and watching a short video, I was off to my private room to shower and soak. The silent and dark, with the lid closed, option sounded like the best way to fully immerse myself into this experience. Here's what I discovered: We all float down here, including me; weightlessness feels great and relaxing; I carry a LOT of tension between my shoulder blades; this water burns your eyes; after 48 minutes in this environment, I become anxious; I'll be going back again.\n\nMy friend Keith said I'd probably sleep better than ever that night, which wasn't the case. While my body was completely relaxed, my mind was fully ignited. I could probably have invented Post-Its if I focused on that. But I did remain physically at peace for several days thereafter. The Noob-Kit all first-timers receive includes a packet of Epsom salt so you can attempt to recreate the experience at home (I haven't tried this yet). True Rest offers packages for monthly floats."
1,"Loved this Joint... Love No More... !\nThey have changer everything, the only Buffet they have available now is the Hot-Dog Buffet, with only ONE choice of Dog... they used to have at least 8 choices of Weiner's, Brats, Smoked Sausages, Dog's from New York, Chicago...etc... it ROCKED..!!!  they still have Sandwiches a-la-carte... No more Prime Rib or Crab Legs... \nthey used to have a soft-serve Ice Cream that was part of the Buffet's, no more, now thy have a glassed in Ice Cream freezer with scoops you can purchase... \n\nHey it's not bad but it's NOT G's anymore..!!! call it something else...\n \nI'm not going back ...they didn't honour my \""Yelp Deal\""  that I bought for $10 that buys you a coupon for $20 worth of food from G's... I believe that legally they have to take the \""Yelp Deals\""...\nwe paid the bill with cash and said Adi\u00f3s to the Cook... \n\nI don't expect them to survive for very long unless they go back to the G's we all know and Love... \n\nIf it Ain't broke don't break-it... :("
3,"One of my favorite taco places. It's super far from me but every time I'm on this side of town I always have to stop by here for a few freshly made tacos.\n\nIt's about $2+ per taco. All served with corn tortilla which I personally don't like since I prefer flour tortilla and to get flour tortilla it's an extra $.50 per taco (which sucks bc you would think that it's included, all those $.50s add up haha) \n\nWeds is buy 1 ($2) get the 2nd taco free on the pork taco ..in other words a $1 each"
0,do not eat here it is not worth the money
3,"Spinach salad is a must try.  Pad thai is good, not as good as Lotus of Siam.  Pad see ew tastes similar to Pin Kaow.  Really good thai iced tea.  Pricier than most thai restaurants.\n\nService is good and fast.  Decor is lovely.  I will probably go once in a while but since Pin Kaow is nearby, this will not be a regular place for me."
2,"\""If you build it, they will come\"" - but maybe not to Chase Field, well... unless the team is winning of course. But even then, they will only come depending on the food options and free promotions available to them on that particular day. \n \nAlright Diamondbacks Nation... well maybe not nation, maybe Diamondbacks fans? Nope, there aren't enough of you for that title either. What about supporters? Maybe groupies? Well whatever you're called, where are you? You've got one gorgeous baseball field and a World Series title, yet this stadium sits lifelessly in the Arizona desert.\n \nIt's sad actually. Chase Field is gorgeous, and dare I say... breathtaking. Stretching far and wide across the Phoenix skyline, Chase Field stands tall among the buildings that call downtown Phoenix home. This technological work of art brought baseball to the desert, and that's quite a feat. Even some of baseballs greatest players, like The Big Unit for example, have called it home. Sparkling clean and strategically situated for easy access and parking, Chase Field calls out to \""D-Backs fans\"" - begging them to venture though its towering gated entrance to seek sanctuary within its cool climate controlled atmosphere. All of the vendors, ushers and ballpark staff at this stadium are also welcoming, helpful and friendly. There isn't a bad seat at Chase Field. The view is virtually perfect from every angle. Yet the seats remain fan-less. \n \nI do understand part of the reason why fans don't flock to Chase Field. An empty stadium is a common transplant state/expansion team symptom, like the desolate Tropicana Field for example. Most people in Arizona probably aren't even \""D-Backs fans\"". I get that. I'm not one. But even I pay more attention to the action at Chase Field and have more admiration of its beauty than a majority of those \""D-Backs fans.\"" \n\nIt is as if \""D-Backs fans\"" are confused, and they think Chase Field is an indoor shopping mall - because in between the shopping, the food, the activities, the awful emcee that talks in between innings, the dancing and the trivia games, none of the \""D-Backs fans\"" seem to have time to watch baseball.  \n\nSo \""D-Backs fans\"" - you need to up your appreciation level for the game. It's the roar of the crowd that brings a stadium to life. Team pride is what makes or breaks a ballpark's atmosphere. And when you are talking on your phone through an entire at bat, standing up right in the middle of a crucial pitch to get more ballpark chow or allowing your children to turn empty seats into their own personal jungle gym or hide and go seek game, why even come to the stadium? Go to the mall or visit a park for that matter. Regardless of whether you're in first place or last place, this is your team in your city. It's not enjoyable to see such beauty go to waste. So stop swimming in your indoor ballpark pool (I still can't believe how tacky that pool looks in the outfield), worry about what ice cream extravaganza you are going to stuff your face with later, and let's watch some baseball! \n \nIt's called game time \""D-Backs fans\"", not play time."
3,"A club that doesn't charge and entry fee and does their own version of Jager Bombs (Opium Bombs) for just \u00a31.50.  Honestly, what more do you want?\n\nEdinburgh's club scene seems to be divided between meat markets and posing parlours and this is about the only other option!  \n\nAbsolutely no pretentiousness to the place at all which is the best thing about it.  You can be totally who you are and not have to worry.  \u00a31 beers will certainly help you to forget your troubles too.  \n\nThis place is really cool but be careful as it is easy to get lost and loose your friends in the maze of cubby holes and areas that they have.  Downstairs you can prop up the beautiful blue tiled bar or grab a booth and relax.  Upstairs is where it really kicks off on the dance floor to good rock tunes.  \n\nGood fun any night of the week.  Open until 3am, always a good shout."
2,"Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant, we were here for the bar/lounge scene. We paid $20 to get in and have free drinks the whole night, so that was a plus. I'd say this is one of those places where you're better off splurging on bottle service, because that's the only way you're going to have any room to dance and not bump into anybody. The DJ was decent, no one special, just spinning the latest Top 40 tracks. I enjoyed the crowd, which was a plus as I spent most of my time there smashed up against them as I was dancing. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here during my next trip to Vegas and trying the cuisine!"
2,"I went to this location today and found it to now be Dori's Bakery.  I met the owner/baker and she is very nice.  She gave me a sample of her chicken salad and I loved it.  She has baked goods and also sandwiches and soups.  She said everything is made fresh.  I had just eaten over at the Peruvian place in the same center but plan to go back for a soup and salad, maybe a pastry or cookie.  Oh yeah, she has quiche, too.  And cheesecake, but I don't know if is the same kind as this place had.  I would have liked to taste theirs after reading the reviews."
1,"This place USED to be so great, what happened?? The last 3 times we went there we were very unimpressed and have pretty much given up. Each time the service was very slow, the help acts like they are overwhelmed and don't know what to do. But worse of all, the food has become ordinary! Something has definitely changed there and not for the better."
2,"We decided to go to Coco's despite the not-so-good reviews. We were greeted by the friendly host as soon as we walked in.  While we just got dessert to go, from what we saw the restaurant looked a little older, but clean.  We ordered a slice of the raspberry swirl cheesecake and a piece of boysenberry pie. The pie was good and the cheesecake was even better. I would definitely go back and try out their dine-in service."
2,"THE GOOD: \n1.) CONVENIENT - Late night food alternative that is close enough to the strip. \n2.) INEXPENSIVE - especially after burning money on gambling, partying, and overpriced club drinks! \n3.) QUICK SERVICE - It's a freaking fast food chain...it better be.\n4.) MOSTLY TASTY GRUB - The tacos and burritos are pretty good. However, their Menudo really hits the spot....especially after a cold crazy night.\n\nTHE BAD: \n1.) FOOD SUPPLY - They often run out of certain food items.\n2.) FOOD QUALITY - There have been some menu items that was definitely a miss and not a hit (might just be bad preparation). \n2.) INCONSISTENT SERVICE - Sometimes the service sucks.THEY FORGOT MY BURRITO!!! \n3.) RUNDOWN VENUE - The restaurant is kinda cheesy: jacked up jukebox busting out the Mexican music, the old school tables/chairs, and the cleanliness of the front counter definitely doesn't win \""positive\"" awards. \n4.) SKETCHY AREA: There is a reason the place is caged up like minimum security prison. I've seen freaky things happen there - a guy beaten up and robbed right outside, the standard late-night fight between rowdy customers, and what looked to be an unfit teen mom with a half-naked baby that seemed to have horrible mouth sores (CALL CHILD SERVICES!!!)\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT: TACOS MEXICO...SURE WHY NOT!?!\nCheap, semi-dirty Mexican food is definitely a good cure after a Vegas night of partying, drunkenness, and debauchery. If you're above and beyond the clean, pricey late night eats within the strip (side note: GET OFF YOUR FREAKING HIGH HORSE!!!), then head down to the ghetto cuz Tacos Mexico definitely fits the bill!"
2,"OK this place is good during the week and early on the weekends\nLate on weekends it kinda really sucks.\ntoo many, too little space."
3,"We ate here with some of my boyfriend's hometown friends. The food  was pretty decent, all fresh-tasting Italian. The vodka pasta the other couple mostly split was well-seasoned and wonderful, but not really worth the price tag. The steak with warmed tomatoes, one of the veal dishes, and a broccolini/sweet sausage pasta dish rounded out the meal...all very good dishes, but nothing outstanding or really that memorable. I love Italian food and pasta, but Rao's was a tad overpriced. The portions were large, but the 4 of us opted to share everything \""family-style,\"" to taste more dishes...which I also HIGHLY reccomend. I think if we had all picked one dish, we either would have been bored, disappointed, or spent too much and had too much left over to order courses. \n\nThe waiter was extremely knowledgable about the food, restaurant, chef, wine, etc....but he was sort of obnoxious and in our faces and too much....It was also a little strange to me how much information he went on about...at a nicer place like that, to just assume all of the diners were idiots with an utter lack of food knowledge was a little strange. The waiter often explained dishes and items to us, like describing the different levels of doneness for steak, explaining that broccolini is bitter, etc...I think maybe a different table of people might have loved his comments better, but oh well. All in all this place was just ok, not somewhere I'd bring friends in town to, but I would absolutely eat here meeting people."
1,"Don't get me wrong... I LOVE Senor Frogs. In Mexico, but not here.. The fun was great, the dancing and the view off the patio was great. Service was okay, but took a while to get our check. The prices were outrageous, and the free \""shots\"" were only mixers with no alcohol. The Yard is priced at $24 BUT it's almost the same size as the $10 drink which the only difference is you get to keep the cup. Would I go there again? Probably not, the only thing I would do is go there to watch the Sirens show when its going on from the patio. I was sadly disappointed as it was my 30th birthday. And I have to say that both the Senor's I been to in Mexico (Mazatlan) and Ensenada and this was nothing close to either one of those...  I did not have any food, so I can't review that. Save yourself the cash and go somewhere else... And I have to add the drinks were just okay. My friend got one drink that tasted like it had too much syrup in it."
2,"Went here last week for the first time for a brow wax. First thing my waxer did was complain that she had just burned the roof of her mouth on hot queso she'd scrapped off the bottom of a crock pot. Not too alarming except for the fact that her job requires the exact same skill set to apply hot wax on people's faces! Um, let's use some common sense and not scare away your customers. Moving on."
3,Cafe Rio is one of my favorite Mexican fast food spots.  The portions are large and food is great.  I highly recommend the steak or chicken salads!\n\nA few unusually nice things about Cafe Rio is that they give a free kid's cheese crisp with an adult purchase.  My only complaint is that all they have is a small cheese crisp for a kid's menu.  They also do not have any desserts on the menu.  \n\nTheir prices range from $5 - 8 per item.
4,"This is my favorite place to go when I'm trying get that warm and cozy feeling here in the city. Service is always wonderful. I've surprised them with large parties on numerous occasions, and they always seem to be able to accommodate! Try the California Benedict; it's my favorite! And 3 cheers for fresh orange juice!"
4,"I have checked out many places that say they have the best BBQ and have been disappointed.  But this place not only have great food, but great service.  The kitchen offers many options and the specials are always great (blue cheese burgers, bacon wrapped hot dogs-which are now on the menu!)  They  have a spicy bbq sauce that not many places offer or that really isn't as spicy as i would like.  The food is abundant for the price, sometimes I can't even finish the sandwich and one side.  The green chile mac and cheese is great to pair with any sandwich and you need to bbq it up or you may think the meat is a little dry, but it is not!  It is tender, juicy, and could be eaten alone, but the BBQ does the trick!"
2,"Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere \n\nI make a pilgrimage to this place about every three months. The food is average and overpriced. The service is OK. And there is usually one good Pale Ale on tap and overpriced. \n\nIt is kinda like going to Disneyland. You know you are going to take in the shorts but you go anyway. You go to live the dream if only for an hour or two. \n\nIf you ever went fishing as a kid or wished you had,  grab your wallet or purse and eat here asap."
2,"Ice Pan is an interesting take on an already saturated chilled dessert market. The iced cream is made right in front of you with subtle variations on your classic flavors. This establishment is indeed somewhat pricey, but if you compare it to every other place on the strip, it is a perfectly acceptable amount to pay for a dessert.\n\nThe taste is nothing phenomenal, but they way they prepare it kinda is. the ice cream is made right in front of you as they turn milk and fruit into customized ice cream. The cream is poured onto this chilled pan / wok and freezes almost instantly. The ice cream masters then proceed to stir, scrape, slap, and slice the ice cream using knife-like spatulas with such speed and precision that you'd think you were watching a Benihana chef in action. Seriously, if they brought a knife to a gun fight, they would still have a chance at coming out on top.\n\nAs for eating the ice cream, the taste was a little light, which is kinda nice after a heavy Las Vegas meal, but deep down, I was kinda hoping for a little more umph from the flavor. Depending on who you get to prepare it, the consistency can be super creamy or hard and dense. If you get a more senior preparer, the cream comes out very smooth and can be almost gelato-like. If your preparer is the young one who has yet to master the tricks of the trade, the cream may be left on the ice pan a bit too long and freeze a little harder than it probably should.\n\nWith both ups and downs to this eatery, I think the Yelp rating system hit this one right on the mark, it is A-OK."
2,"This sis way out of my 'hood, but I wanted to check out the Outlets opening weekend. Parking was not the worst, but what they had their staff directing didn't really make sense. It didn't take me too long to find a spot, though my friend I met up with parked across the way at Westgate which was easier. It was pretty crowded giving it was the day after Black Friday. Just browsing, there wasn't too much that caught my eye. I did notice, like others, that there is a severe lack of food venues, and the line for the pretzel place was out the door because of this. The prices were I did end up buying a  few things were worth it, but I can't say I'd make the drive out there unless I was desperate."
3,"I was FINALLY able to try the famous Burgatory here in Pittsburgh!\n\nSome of my first thoughts--very cool looking place! I love the walls and decorations they have around the joint. The bar is also very contemporary and sits nicely in the restaurant.\n\nThe burgers? Good--but I have to report (sadly) that I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because there has been so much hype about these places and from my friends that I thought that the burger would have just blown me away. I had a milkshake for desert. Spiked was a little too rich I thought.\n\nIs it worth it? Sure, but not for a 30 minute plus wait. Come check it out for yourself!"
2,Arrived around 10 so a little late but not crazy. No waiting but the place was fairly  busy. Drink order was a little slow. Food came out fairly quickly and was prepared properly. My steak was very fatty but tasty. \nAwesome bread. Overall a nice place but texas Roadhouse is better and less expensive :)
1,"For Christmas, my boyfriend and I received movie tickets and a gift card to CPK for a fun movie date night. We decided to make the plan happen one night and were excited to get out, as we hadn't been to the movies in a long time. \n\nWe decided to sit at the bar at CPK because we were watching the World Cup. The bar area is probably not the most popular spot in the whole restaurant, because it only sits like 10 patrons, but we took a chance. Our bartender was a little strange. He mentioned that he doesn't drink repeatedly and it made ordering drinks a little awkward. At one point, we ordered a lemon drop shot and we asked if he could make them. He said they had a martini and he could just pour it into two glasses. Sure. Ok. Fine. I guess that works. It turns out he made each one of us a martini in a rocks glass and charged us for two martinis. This is not what we asked for. And next time, we'll just ask for a table so the bartender who doesn't drink won't make us feel weird about ordering drinks.\n\nI believe our meal was good, I just can't get over the lemon drop shot/martini confusion. I don't mind if someone who works as a bartender doesn't drink, but they should know how to make drinks, which is their job. Part of what you're paying for when you go out is the experience and it kind of ruins it when the situation gets weird."
2,"Aria is a relatively new and nice hotel. The staffs are friendly. The casino is very straight forward and organized. I love how Jean Philippe is by the guest rooms so very convenient for breakfast, snack and coffee. \n\nThe guest rooms hallway is super confusing. It was never-ending and it criss-cross at some point...imagine finding your room if you're drunk. \n\nThe room is nice. I like how it's pretty automatic with the window and \""service\"" and \""private\"" button and all. I like how the shower is connected to the tub. Thre room is pretty clean and spacious.\n\nThe pool is nice along with three jacuzzi. I like how you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the pool. You just have to go to the promenade floor. But it's weird, it seems like the pool is open to anyone public and not just hotel guess. \n\n I like how they have a tram that's connected to Bellagio and Crystals. The Cosmopolitan is also just few minute walks away. It's super convenient!! Will definitely like to stay there again."
0,"Just AWFUL. Please take my advice, don't even give it a chance. Like I did. Major-HUGE mistake. Awful coffee. Awful pancakes. And just the most awful service!"
0,I went about 2 months ago the food was horrible if I can recall it was the green chile verde envhiladas that i had they were bland and horrible. And the side of beans which I'm not really a big fan of anyways but given I am mexican those were the most dissapointing watery beans I've had in my entire life. The place looks very outdated and by the way the food tasted and was presented I wouldn't doubt if it most of the food ob my plate wasn't made fresh that day so dissapointed with this place I even remember putting on the reciept that I'd never recommend a friend to eat their.
3,We came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch after the good guys car show.  Had no problems getting seated and the waitress was really friendly.  She even got my 16 year old son to smile for a picture.(impossible to even get him to look at a camera)\n\nOur drinks never were empty and the food was good.  I had the meatloaf and mac and cheese.\n\nBest part of the lunch was watching the scottsdale snobs and their kids coming in and turning right around to leave when they realized they were in the wrong place.  It's really not that bad.\n\nLooking forward to hopefully having one on the west side of town.(hint hint)
4,"WOOOOOOW \n\nUMMMMMMM... did I already say WOOOOOW??\n\nWe waited about 25-30 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon/evening/ My group ordered Jalapeno Poppers, and I ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger for myself. \n\nThe Jalapeno Poppers- I can't really say it was good or bad although the sauce was really delicious. Out of the 6 poppers, I got the \""special\"" one, which turned out to be EXTREMELY SPICY!!! OH CRAP. I never got to taste a regular one so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like.. \n\nHell's Kitchen Burger-  my mouth was still burning from the special popper, and I don't normally eat spicy food, but I really wanted to try Hell's Kitchen burger, which is supposed to be somewhat spicy. so I asked our attentive and energetic waiter to put less jalapenos in my burger. The burger still tasted amazing even with less jalapenos. I was a little worried if it was going to be bland, but it wasn't! Oh, how I wished I could finish the burger...I only ate half of it and forgot about the other half and left it in my suite for 2 days! I had to throw it away of course.... I wanted to cry. :'( \n\nI must come back here..."
1,"My husband and I were visiting Vegas for a short weekend and we decided we wanted to get some form of a massage, but didn't want to pay strip prices. I decided to make an appointment at The Foot Spa after reading all of the wonderful reviews on Yelp. The place was pretty easy to find and only a few short miles from the strip. It's located in a primarily Korean shopping center. Cool. We called ahead and made an appointment. We arrived on time and were promptly escorted to our massage area. Now, I know what I was going to be expecting at a place like this as I frequent one similar in my hometown. Every thing started off great until my massage person came in. I am solely basing this review on my massage alone, my husband enjoyed his massage very much and even feel asleep and was snoring. I'm going to start off by saying that my massage person must have just broken up with her boyfriend or something because I was basically tapped and punched through out the whole massage. I asked her to be more gentle about half way through and that lasted for about a second. My whole \""massage\"" basically went like this...tap tap tap, knead knead knead, punch punch. It was truly un-enjoyable and almost unbearable at times...I would have tenderized a piece of meat more gently than the massage I was given. The guy at my nail salon gives a better FREE neck and shoulder massage for 10 minutes than this place. \""Sorely\"" disappointed. Pun intended."
4,"Robin Camacho, the broker, is very knowledgable. I am grateful I received the opportunity to work with her."
2,"We arrived here for Brunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was no wait to pay for the buffet but we waited about 40 minutes to be seated. That was somewhat frustrating as you could see empty tables in the dining room.\n\nThis place is hyped up by fellow Yelpers & foodies, but I don't know that it's the best buffet in Vegas. I would say it's on the same level as the Wynn and a step below Bacchanal.\n\nThe food isn't bad, but it could have been better. I wasn't able to fully satisfy my intense pig-out session, because personally, I didn't see that many foods that I wanted to reach for. They had all the basics like meats, pasta, dessert, etc but nothing too exciting."
3,"I really am not a clothes shopper.  But when I have to go and refresh my wardrobe, this is a good place.  Great variety for all ages, well 30 and over.  Very sophisticated styles.  A bit on the pricey side.  The sales accosiates are always very helpful.  I'm not sure the reason why their sizes are set up differently but it works.  I likey."
0,"The store is dirty, but much worse, the folks at the registers seem to be trained to be rude, and have the social skills of a grocery bag.  I live less than a mile away and was excited to find a Sprouts in my new neighborhood.  After the first few times there, I stopped going and drive well past this store to others.  Recently, I needed some organic tomatoes quickly and so, I thought I would give this Sprouts another try. The girl behind the register never spoke to me and seemed as if it was a real inconvenience to ring up four tomatoes. She practically threw my change and receipt at me.  Never again.  Five or six times of poor service is enough."
3,"The ONLY place to stay in downtown Vegas.  Period! Just went under an almost complete remodel.  Rooms are fresh and spacey.  New pool is really neat (reminded me of the Maui resorts).  Fabulous. \n\nCasino is laid out well, and easy to navigate in.  Buffet is worth it, and other restaurants are of higher quality \n\nYou can walk to the Fremont experience and see all of what you want to see in downtown Vegas from the Nugget.  \n\nSearch their website and other internet sites for great deals. This is definitely a 4 star hotel, and some great bargains for stay can be found at certain times in the year. \n\nSure, its a long way from the Strip, but it seems to be more friendlier and cozy.  \n\nTry it, you'll like it !"
4,"What a terrific experience from start to finish, minus like two things.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cool. A couple of things I really liked was the way they get ice at the bar. No cubes, just a block of ice and the bartender makes the cubes himself. Also, the \""wine cellar\"" is beautiful, not unique but beautiful. Restrooms are awesome, and their private dining rooms are great with a huge 600 year old tree as a table. It is basically an entire tree, as explained by William, the manager. One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.\n\nMonday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill. The server we had was definitely very very good, and perfectly attentive, though as he explained the restaurant and specials he was extremely quiet. I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake. \n\nThe first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.\n\nI do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm. It was DEAD. For Phoenix, this is a truly unique dining option. Roka is a great option for dinner before going out to Old Town, or a great spot to get together with friends to celebrate."
4,"I can't say enough about Drago Sisters Bakery, especially Doreen, one of the sisters, and her niece. Her name, I think, is Elise, and if I'm wrong about both name and/or spelling, please please forgive me! Either way, their service was amazing and the cake was out of this world and beyond our expectations! We'd gotten another quote from another bakery and weren't too thrilled about it, and their Yelp reviews weren't that great. I decided to try Drago Sisters because their Yelp reviews were very good, and we were not disappointed. Doreen quoted us $75 for a small 2-tier cake and set up a tasting so we could choose flavors & fillings. We were charged $20 for the tasting and it was worth every penny; Elise (again sorry if I'm wrong!) coordinated the tasting and was so gracious and friendly...and we got to have cake for breakfast! A win-win all around. We made our choices and I was thrilled with the end product. Not only was it absolutely beautiful, it was delicious. One tier of vanilla cake with white chocolate mousse filling, and the small top tier of chocolate cake with chocolate mousse filling. The cake itself was so pretty...a work of art, really, and I didn't want to cut it. Of course we did though! I thought I could post a pic of the cake but apparently not, which is a shame because it truly is gorgeous. The shells were made of white chocolate (they were delicious) and the flowers were crafted out of gum paste (which tasted pretty good actually) and were hard to tell from real flowers. I had someone say to me that they thought the flowers were either real or silk.\n\nAll in all, I would go to Drago Sisters for any future event that needs a cake because they deliver above and beyond, at completely reasonable and budget-conscious prices. I highly recommend Drago Sisters!"
1,"My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and had lunch at Bahn Thai last week. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Just OK. It was also way overpriced. It's possible that we just need to get used to the cost of food out here (as opposed to Southern California); but we ordered Pad Thai, Red Curry, Papaya Salad and chicken soup. My husband had iced tea and I had Thai tea. Our bill came out to $66. We'd have Thai food regularly in CA and we'd try different Thai restaurants to change things up, but I don't think we've ever paid that much for Thai food. One thing I thought was interesting was that they also have a sushi bar. I didn't see an itamae there so I don't think we'll be trying their sushi."
1,"Drove nearly 45 min to get here and we were greatly disappointed that we did. I am a big BBQ fan and this was underwhelming. The food was ok, portions were small, it was pricey, and the service was bad. We got in line and carefully planned what we were going to get for us and our kiddos. It was finally our turn to order and they were out of almost everything we asked for. We watched them haul off several trays of food for catering - guess it impeded their ability to maintain their supply in the restaurant. We ended up with several items we didn't really want. The young girl manning the counter was inattentive, easily distracted by her fellow co-workers and unapologetic for being out of stuff. We finally got our food and headed for a table - but they were all dirty. We ended up finding the least dirty table and cleaning it off ourselves. \n\nI am not a fan and needless to say we will not be stopping in again."
3,"have to write a quickie!\nthis was great, my BFF and i jumped on the rail on monday, and went to Casey Moores. i had never gone she loves the place. i was not disappointed, it was a beautiful day and we sat outside. services was great. beer was great. i had wings, i liked them. we did order potato skins,which had green chile's in them, kinda weird?? but i liked it, other people at the table didn't..\noverall i will be going back."
3,"Leider musste der Starbucks oben auf dem Tower weichen. Evtl. zu Gunsten eines weiteren \""Fahrgesch\u00e4ftes\"".\n\n\n Der Starbucks auf dem Casino-Level existiert aber noch.\nEin Starbucks wie jeder andere in den Staaten. Hier jedoch erschien mir das Personal etwas pfiffiger als in vielen anderen Starbucksfilialen. Und leider kann man bei der Kaffeezubereitung doch Fehler begehen. Diesbez\u00fcglich durfte ich erhebliche Qualit\u00e4tsunterschiede in den USA feststellen.\nBei meinem heutigen Besuch gab es an der Kaffeezubereitung in diesem Store nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln."
2,"Four of us went for breakfast.  2 of us had the $5.99 steak and egg special, which includes house fried potatoes (which are amazing) and toast.  2 of us had the veggie omelet, which was packed with fresh veggies, smothered with cheese, and also served with potatoes and toast.  With coffee and tip, total bill was less than $35. Great deal.  \nService was very good, servers were really friendly and refills of coffee/water were abundant.\nWe returned for dinner the next day.  2 of us had the penne al forno, which was creamy and delicious.  2 of us had the burgers with no complaint.  The best part-- $2.25 20 oz. beers that are brewed in house.  Both the Hefe and the Light are very smooth.  Total bill for 5 beers and 4 entrees was $45, a steal for being walkable from the strip."
0,"I would not return to this restaurant. First off you start your dining experience with 6 menus, and they aren't even nice, well thought out menus, they are printed on computer paper, stapled and dirty. They do not have descriptions of their rolls or drinks and it is unnecessary and confusing to have that many menus. Their prices seem reasonable until you realize how small the portions are. The taste wasn't bad but after a $50 tab, my guest and I left unsatisfied and still hungry. They have a $5 tapas menu which I tried the bacon wrapped dates off of. There were only 5 dates which tasted amazing but again, the portion was ridiculous. The same thing with the rolls, the caterpillar had great flavor but there were 8 slices of the smallest roll I've ever had and it cost $13. To top it off, service was extremely slow even though the restaurant wasn't very busy and my guest and I had to help a fellow customer in a wheelchair maneuver around their tiny restaurant. There are too many fantastic sushi places in the area to waste your time on this one."
3,"Slightly embarrassed to say I have never been to this place intoxicated and am still giving a 4 star review.  \n\nMy husband (a U of I grad) and I have been here 4 times over the course of the past few years and have never been disappointed aside from the less than sanitary bathrooms midday.  The least exciting menu option (in my humble opinion) is my husband's favorite, that being the hasbrown, sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich.  I try something new everytime, and I even felt compelled to buy a \""What the F\"" shirt.   Word."
2,"So, I had the Hotlink Sandwich It had real good flavor not Spicy thou, But good flavor. I wish it was hotter in both the Spicy and the temperature of the Meat it was room temperature you would think it would be warm or at less the BBQ sauce would have been warm. They had a couple different kinds if BBQ sauces witch was nice unfortunately I wasn't a fan of either one.The atmosphere was real nice real layed back long tables like you sitting and a family picnic was nice different I liked it. Over all I'll go back again"

2,"Best taco I had was the shrimp taco from Monti's. Now I'm think I should have went back and tried their beef or steak taco. The event was cool. Parking wasn't terrible, people were nice and tacos were $2. Entertainment was kinda lame. There were bean bag toss and a wrestling ring. Other than that, you can go buy drinks for $6.\n\nOther notable tacos I ate were the duck tacos, and the avocado ice cream taco... Which was more of a dessert than really tacos. I wish it tasted more like avocado.\n\nIf you are into eating tacos, then this is the event for you! Are $2 tacos cheap? Because I didn't think so. haha. Maybe it's because I'm a 99 cent taco kind of guy. \n\nThink of it this way... you pay $12 to get in, and then it's $2 tacos. By the time you hit $20, you ate four sample size tacos. Those are $5 sample size tacos you just ate!\n\nBut if you love tacos, eat up! :)"
4,Awesome vet and grooming salon! They don't over charge or try to charge you for everything little thing. They're very patient with our dogs and it's clear that they actually care and have a passion for animals. Never a long wait time or anything to complain about. The grooming service is great as well... Much cheaper than other places and our dogs come out smelling and feeling nice and clean. Will definitely go back.
3,We got a two room suite with a kitchenette. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is great. They have a full breakfast Buffett that is delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They also have a shuttle that takes you right to the strip.
1,Too expensive. Food is alright. I rather go to either Bellagio or Rio.
2,"Ok, I guess a place like this works in Charlotte. I am between a 3 and 4 star for this place. I have been waiting for a LOOONG time to give the place a try, and just to show you how long I have been waiting for the occasion, I came on a Sunday, they were closed. I came after 10 one night on Friday they were closed. I live close to the south park area and have drove by the restaurant many other times. Last night though, I finally made it here.\n\nI have several problems with this place. Space wise, it just isn't really enough to accomodate the customers. At first I thought this would be a romantic kind of upscale dining option with delicious food. WRONG. The place was SOO loud I could not even have a conversation with the person I was with who sits only ummm..10 inch from me? \n\nProblem number 2. Our waiter(pale, heavy white male) was being pretty impatient with us. For an upscale dining experience, this is really not good. And he was pretty monotone and seemed bored trying to explain the fish of the day to us...\n\nProblem number 3. Waiter was being pushy, for ordering more and for getting in and out of there quick. Well I guess maybe they just simply is having a space issue. \n\nThe parking. The parking lot is small, you will have a problem finding a spot. But the worse is, there is NOO way for my friend to back out, he had to reverse ALL the way out in order to drive out...the scariest parking experience ever. And my friend's car is pretty compact....This parking lot sounds like an accident bound to happen. The dumpster takes up half of the spot beside us so the lady could only park her car half way in...I wonder who's responsibility it would be if her car is accidentally damaged?\n\nThe food. It's definitely above average. Was it life changing? No. The portions are wayy too small for the price. Literally my friend was even like,\"" ohh, is that it to the dish?\"" For the price I paid I feel like I could have gotten more food and a less hectic experience at a better place. \n\nThe food did roll out pretty fast. But then again...it's not like we are ordering home made pizza or something that would take a while to cook. \n\nThe guy at the front who works as a hostess was awesome. The other person in my party had arrived before me. When I showed up, the hostess asked me if I was meeting a friend, I said yes and he answered \""I know exactly where he is and showed me the way\"". On our way out, he also bid us farewell and wished us a nice night. \n\nDecoration is pretty rusty modern. They cover each table with the paper tablecloth with the restaurant's name on it. Two glasses per person, one for water, another empty glass for wine. Every table gets complimentary sour dough bread paired with oil and balsamic vinegar and roasted garlic dip. The menu is just one side, not many options really...Make sure you are ok with that. This is like an upscale tapas place but a tad less fun. Oh, they also have a nice outdoor seating lounge area...but I don't suppose you'll want to have a meal out there, maybe a drink. \n\nONLY open for dinners Monday-Saturday. Come early or you'll have to wait."
2,"As a restaurant owner, I am a little over critical of my experiences in other restaurants.  My first visit to Cafe Monte was a birthday surprise a couple months ago.  As we were seated, the person who brought us water spilled a large glass of water all over the three of us, drenching our clothes and the table.  We had to move to another table but nobody ever came and apologized for the mishap.  Everyone has a bad day but this should have been rectified by a complimentary glass of wine or dessert, not just ignored.  \n\nOn to the food!  I had the Lobster Risotto which was the absolute BEST seafood dish I have ever eaten.  There were huge chunks of fresh lobster and it was all I could do to tear myself away from devouring the whole large portion they gave me.  I took the rest home and it was just as good when I warmed it up.  A+++\n\nI'm not crying over spilled water but the lack of concern was what promted a 3-star rating.  The food was definitely 5+ star worthy & been calling me back ever since.  I have reservations tonight and already know what I'm going to order."
0,"We were just at coyote ugly and had an absolutely horrible experience. We went to the washroom and then the bouncer Martin Hampton would not let us back in. No one is an angel in vegas, but we were clearly not out of control. He claimed we  were and we are parents at almost 50 years of age with three boys. I don't know what they were up to, but they ruined our evening. When you are wrong, that is fine, but this situation baffles me. Don't you want business? and i write this note in the clearly inebriated state that they assessed me at? \n\nAVOID"
3,Convenient and small looking place for a quick bite. Come in hungry and leave satisfied. Great place for meat lovers. Highly recommended if your walking around Edinburg castle.
4,"I just recently discovered Aerial Yoga from a friend and I'm totally addicted!!!  Altitude Aerials has a Aerial Yoga class on Saturday and Sunday and not only is it an amazing workout, and fun to do, but it's affordable too!\n\nMy review is based only on the Aerial Yoga classes... I haven't been to any of their Aerial shows or training yet but I do plan on it!"
2,"Snapshot review: Probably a better environment for lunch or drinks vs. dinner.\n\nCame here on a busy Saturday night (with a reservation, fortunately). The four of us were seated promptly at a corner table, which we had requested because one of us was hard of hearing. Good move--it quickly became very loud, and that was even before the band began playing!\n\nThe food was good--two of us had the chicken souvlaki, one had the spinach pie, and one I forget. The service was decent, if a bit slow. Good value for the money, too. I think I would have given it 4 stars for lunch, honestly. It was just loud and slow at dinnertime."
0,The food was ok. The restraunt area was way to open. Chips and Salsa was really good the main meal not as much...
0,"My wife and I had lunch here and were very disappointed in the food and prices. I don't mind spending $40 on 2 dishes of good mexican food but the good we got was horrible. The grilled fish tacos were super small, fishy, and just bland. The sides of rice were too salty and the beans were dry and looked liked yesterdays beans. The chicken salad also was bland and the dressing was just horrible as well. I was also disappointed on the 3 salsas that came with the chips. My local senor fish has way better food and salsas. \n\nThe only thing the was nice was the upper deck seating and the service. You can do way better for $50 after taxes and drinks."
4,"1)This is one of the MUST go when you stop by Las Vegas.\n2)The pizza here is top notch. Authentic Naples pizza. Period. I went to Naples 5 times during these 10 years and I always stop by Da Michele. Now I have to stop by Novecento when I am in Vegas.\n3)There are some magic going on between the dough and chef's special 900 degree oven. If you come for the 1st time, let the chef pick for you. Simple is good, believe me.\n4)Their salads and espressos are decent. Chef simply bring the whole Naples Pizzeria culture to Vegas. Way to go!\n5)I always admire chefs who bring authenticity to their cuisine. This is FINE ARTS. This is how cooking should be."
0,"UGH.  I was hyped rehab for ... ever a couple of years back.  I was all hyped to go until I got there.  Seriously, I won't even admit how much of my life I wasted waiting to get into this frat house on crack. It's a shame. Seriously.  The only reason we waited that long was because that was the whole point of the trip.\n\nAnyway by the time we did get in it was not scorching hot, everyone was hammered the pool looked green (YES! What do you think these dirtbags are actually going to get OUT of the pool to piss?!) \n\nThis is the level of NASTY that you're working with: I was wearing a white bikini top with brown trim.. by the time i got to my hotel the white of my bikini was YELLOW. And I truly doubt that it was the amount of chlorine.\n\nThis place is nasty.  The only reason people like it is because these stupid skank girls go there practically naked.  Get a job as a stripper and call it a day ho-bag.  And the tool beefcakes that go there are all the same, L-A-M-E.\n\nThe bathrooms? Nasty.\nThe drinks? One plastic water bottle thingy of margarita-type drink was $35. Yes, Thirty-effing-Five.  For one drink.\nThe cover? $50. Stupidest waste ever.\nCrowded? There were THOUSANDS of people in that pool area. gross.\nThe crowd? Cool if you are 21 of if you have the maturity of a high school kegger party crowd still.\n\nThe one crappy thing about it was that I was at the Hard Rock's pool before Rehab started for the season and it was perfect.\n\nBut Rehab? I would rather go to the Wet Republic any day."
3,"BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu.  The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be, Avocado Spring Rolls!  Delicious, warm, a joy to eat.  I swear to god, the 2nd time I had these was better then the first.  \n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5??  Well, the first time I went with a friend, we tried one of the microbrews.  It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion.  Anyway, I stick to the beers I know and love, same with the food :-)"
2,"Sadly, classic case of caveat emptor in Vegas. Truely a unique experience, I've recommend RRL to everyone.  I would like to think it was just a bad night, but alas my experience is likely indicitive of a bigger issue.\n\nThe bottom line: since last visit prices increased and portion size decreased. (I wish I had realized this last night as the owner happen to be seated at a table behind us with his friends and we had a long conversation about how much we loved the place.)\n\nTook a friend for her 40th birthday as a treat. At first glance in looking at the menu the prices seamed higher than I recalled, but not until comparing reciepts at home today (and the menu here in yelp) was it confirmed. I also left last time feeling full and satisified. This time ordered more and more, but alas left not so full.\n\nExamples of some of the changes:\n- Calamari\n    Previous Price: $10 (also price they show on menu online) \n    Last night: $14\n\n- Short Rib Stoganoff\n    Previous Price: $19 (also price they show on menu online) \n    Last night: $34 \n   Also, look at the pics of fellow yelpers, it used to be 3 portions of rib with  pieces of pasta. Last night it was only 1 with garnish. (not exactly a big plate portion as indicated)\n\nFor roughly the same meal, last time our check was just under $200 for 2 people including a bottle of wine. Last night, with the addition of a flatbread, but otherwise the same meal just over $400.  ouch!\n\nThere are more examples, but you get the idea. I'm sure RRL would say they are just a business adjusting prices based on food costs, and the one time out-of-towners on expense accounts won't bat an eye.\n\nAs a local this went from being my go-to-special plate, to a place that's not quite worth it. (sadly)  \n\n\nSince RRL has entertainment, they charge the LET tax plus sales tax (18%), so that on top of inflated prices and smaller portions...  too much for this gal.\n\nI'm including my prvious review below as context .\n\nReview from 8/22 visit 5 Star\nWell done RRL. While the ticketed show is closed, the restaurant has incorporated 30 minute acts that change & evolve throughout the night. Think speak-easy meets super club with modern tapas plates and a cocktail & wine list fit for foodies.\n\nThe food, entertainment, service and decor are top notch. Perfect for a special night out or client entertaining. \n\nI will be back."
0,"This is update to review submitted in 2011.  Unfortunately apartment management and maintenance have deteriorated with changes to onsite staff.  Pool area is never cleaned, dumpsters have trash everywhere and are disgusting, all plants are dying because they're never watered, and most distressing, downstairs neighbor keeps two pit bull dogs on patio 24 hours a day and they poop and piss on concrete which draws flies and smells horrible.  Attempts to resolve this last issue were unsuccessful.  Probably will be moving out soon.  Very disappointing."
4,"This is definitely the best club I have ever been to and may arguably be the best club at Vegas.  Upon entry, the vibe, the music and the atmosphere simply meshed.  The crowd was A+ in my opinion.  I loved the outdoor pool area and the fact that there was a wading area  where you could get your freak on with the ladies.  I should have never danced in the pool area.  I LOST MY SHOES and I had to walk out barefoot.  Also to top things off, I didn't drink the entire night!  My night at XS made my Vegas trip the best ever!"
0,The manager here is very rude. Did not want to rectify issues of honesty or quality. The customer is definitely not first with this establishment.
2,"Great and unique concept.  Questionable delivery.  Is it a lounge trying to be a night club crossover kind of thing?  Is it a bar? Why is there a bouncer at the door then? Am I confused? Is that woman even wearing shoes?\n\nI went because some friends had a table (they have bottle service at Insert Coins?) and it sounded interesting.  It was interesting.  \n\nI LOVED having old school and new school video games available at my leisure.  At our table, we had two TVs and two consoles.  There were two black binders with all the games they had and all we had to do was ask for one and the waitress would grab it and switch it out whenever we asked.  Service was really relaxed but still attentive.  Our waitress even hung out with us and played Mario Kart when we were one man down.  \n\nThen it got late.  Then, to my right, there was a DJ and an awkward dance floor kind of spot and people dancing and I wasn't quite sure what was happening.  Then to my left, there were people chilling at a relaxed bar and other groups of people around the arcade games.  It's probably just me, but I thought it was odd.\n\nI'd go back, but only if I was with a larger group of people and probably only if it was for a special occasion.  Oh, and parking is a pain.  But parking downtown is always a pain."
0,"In sum - WalMart. \n\nMy girlfriend likes -- for whatever strange, twisted reason (tradition, to torture me?) -- to come to this cesspool. Alright. I purchased some car windshield wipers at another, dirtier WalMart (I'll review that gem another day) and I misplaced the receipt. I always figured that WalMart prided itself on two things: lowest prices on its subpar product lines (which is not even true, RE: lowest prices) and taking anything back for exchange (they give you a gift card).\n\nSomeone forgot to tell the CS 'ASSOCIATE'/wench that treated me like a convicted rapist/thief while she performed the exchange for me. \n\nI gave my girlfriend the gift card and said lets go. Something was wrong with their pharmacy (really typical, not atypical) so we could actually really go. \n\nWalMart. - E"
0,Tried this place twice and both times service was very slow and food was overpriced for what we got. Staff (including management) not very friendly or helpful. It's a shame bc I enjoy staying at this hotel.
1,"This was a flat tire for me too.:(  It seemed like it would be a great idea but the service was less then hospitable, the food was portioned for a small mouse...and it was boring and literally thrown on a plate.  If this place wants to be a player it needs to get something better to wash down the wine with!"
2,"If you love M&Ms, this place is your Mecca.  If you don't, it will bore you to tears.\n\nI happen to fall in the latter category (yeah, I know, I know -- but M&Ms really *don't* do it for me).  The first time I was in Vegas, I just came in to see the panoply of M&M colors you won't find elsewhere.  And on that count, I wasn't disappointed.  You won't be, either: the candy wall is definitely a sight to see and the reason I give them three stars.\n\nThis visit we went in because it was so darn hot out and M&Ms' doors were open, blasting cool, conditioned air at us when we oozed by.  So I figured I'd pop over to see what was new in the M&Ms rainbow.  The so-called \""Vampire\"" mix with gray, black, white, and red candies made me giggle.  \n\nSome of the merchandise is cute, I suppose, if you lust after the melt-in-your-mouth-not-in-your-hand candies.  Whatever you can think of, they've put the M&Ms logo on it.  But who buys the sequined M&Ms purses???"
4,"Under new ownership.  The old place was scary.  The new owners are cheery and nice.  Great prices ($20.00 for mani etc)  They have about 65 of the 85 new shellac manicure colors.  Great new massage chairs.  Ask for Michelle or Tiffany.  The great thing is that the music isn't horrible (still going to be adult contemporary stuff but at least no Bolton) and the products are good.  They don't sit around and talk about you (always my annoyance at the nail salons) and the massages are great.  They also do brow waxes but I haven't tried that yet.  Parking is weird, there is plenty of it but virtually none in front.  They are speedy and efficient which is always nice.  Especially if you are in a rush.  The great thing too is that they have a tendency to stay late past their normal closing hours so if it's a true nail emergency you know you have a chance at getting in even if you're ten minutes after closing."
0,"Don't even think about eating here...I ate here twice, once for the dinner buffet and the other time in their restaurant for breakfast.  In both cases the atmosphere was depressing, the food bland and tasteless, the servers, absolutely superb.  I have never seen servers/waitresses more upbeat and friendly, it's a shame they are given such a poor product. One waitress in particular when I commented on the food just rolled her eyes, she seemed to immediately understand exactly what I was saying. There was a waitress in the restaurant where I had breakfast, think I heard she was 68, and I told her that she was 100 times better than the food, and that says it all.\n\nThe buffet selection is poor, the ceilings are incredibly low, the food is bland, it's just a yucky atmosphere.\n\nI actually like the hotel, you can find some incredible rates for staying there on i4vegas, just don't eat there.\n\nHas to be one of the most depressing buffets I've ever been at in Las Vegas.  Seriously, you don't know me, but in this instance, \""trust me\"".\n\nGo elsewhere to eat, even for breakfast, no matter how cheap it is.\n\nYuck."
0,"The restaurant is under new ownership, and just reopened in the last couple weeks.  The previous owner carried the recipes over from the original owner, Myles.  They were excellent authentic Cornish Pasties.\n\nThis new owner must not have gotten the pasty recipes in the deal.  They currently only have a couple breakfast pasties and one lunch menu option, the ground beef pasty.  So I went withe the ground beef pasty.\n\nThis pasty was like eating an unseasoned dry hamburger wrapped in slightly overcooked pie crust.  There was no hint of potatoes, onions, or anything but ground beef inside it.  The portion size was about half the size of what the original pasties were.  This actually was fine since it took a full can of soda to make it through the size that it was because it was so dry.\n\nI will not eat there again.  I can't wait to see what will take its place next.  Too bad since Teddywedger's has been in that location for decades."
0,"They moved to 2501 N. 32nd St. in Phoenix. The areas around parking lot are discusting with animal feces everywhere, that no one (staff) picks up. This is a serious health hazard, considering most patients seen there are receiving chemo treatment. The above reviews are accurate. Only wait times are more like 3 hours."
2,"Limited menu, high prices... tasty but not filling. I probably won't go back, but that shouldn't stop you from at least trying it."
2,"Great little brunch spot. All local and organic food. Service was friendly, atmosphere was a little lacking. Will definitely go back."
3,"one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food."
1,Seeing how the one in Chandler closed we drove to the one in Mesa.  Came early 4:30 pm  for dinner on Sunday.  We sat in the bar in one of the booths for dinner.  Order was taken promptly by bar person.  While waiting for food we had the house wine ($3.00 per glass at happy hour) it was very good.  The food took 30 min to arrive.  Food was good although portions were a bit small.  The bread and olive oil was very good.    Restaurant was almost empty you would think the service would be better.  Never saw the manager to check on us.  They need to step it up a notch.
3,"We came here on a Thursday night with a large group of 20 plus.  The place was extremely accomodating in that they let us form our own impromptu groups/seating.  The service was great.  The servers checked-in on us as a group and individually.  Without even asking, they kept all our bills separately which made settling the check a breeze.  Trust me, that is a huge undertaking in group settings.  Decent list of wine selections.  The pizza was delicious.  Definitely a cool chill place to be if you want to get away from the craziness everywhere else on Mill."
0,"WORST POSSIBLE USE OF $200\n\nI didn't know it's generally common to get a free consultation from a lawyer.  Black & Lobello easily capitalized on my lack of knowledge and took my $200 -- in advance -- for a consultation.  I'm not one to think I can get something for nothing so I naively thought that paying $200 would get some real advice.  Not here.  The lawyer gave me literally nothing of use.  She was giving me the most vague and general answers to my questions.  After awhile I could hear her typing on her keyboard, oh checking email now are we?  On my dime?  So unprofessional.  I feel like I already know how they treat a paying customer so no need to continue with these people.  \n\nOn their part they should be ashamed about taking advantage of people.  On my part, expensive lesson learned."
2,"Considering this is a recently built stadium, it seriously lacks character.  I paid 220 for a ticket behind homeplate and it was fun!  I got to check out the stadium's radar gun and jive with some of the scouts who were taking stats for whatever purpose.\n\nThe stadium itself makes for a poorer experience compared to other ballparks (I've been to 14 of 30 as of this writing).  It's like Dodger Stadium or Miller Park - very large and \""anti-intimate\"".  This is what true baseball fans abhor in their ballparks.  \n\nThe neighborhood surrounding Chase Field contains many bars and is clean and new.  Petco Park has a better scene though (This might be unfair because Petco Park and Wrigley Field are among the best ballpark neighborhoods.  In fact, most ballparks have dumpy neighborhoods - US Cellular, Minute Maid Park, Miller Park, Comerica Park).\n\nDon't ever visit Chase Field if you're a baseball nut and just want to see the ballpark.  It will disappoint you."
2,Decent.
2,"The skybar itself did not wow me, but I guess it's cool that it's different than the usual bars/clubs in Southside.  The place was small and can get kinda steamy if crowded.  Maybe it's better during the warmer season.  It was colder when my friends and I went, so it was covered.\n\nThe pre-made frozen drinks at skybar weren't that great according to my friends.  One had the pina colada, which she said didn't taste anything like pina colada.  Tasted like frozen nasty alcohol.  My other friend had the strawberry daiquiri, which she ended up returning to the bar after 2 sips.  The bartender was nice enough to change it to a better tasting drink that's on the rocks instead of being frozen.  I don't really know whether to recommend this place to a friend, I guess I will if it's their first time.  Otherwise, I probably won't go up to skybar.  Also, they charge an $8 cover.\n\nAnyway, we couldn't hear the music, so we decided to go down to Diesel after about 10-15 mins at skybar.  Diesel had more people and definitely more fun than skybar."
0,"My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a birthday present.\nWe both went today and both left feeling like we were better off before we went in.\n\nMy sister made the appointment a month ago and it was for a facial, massage and pedicure.  We were expecting a call to confirm the appointment yesterday but no one had called, hmmm, not very professional...\nWe went in and the majority of the \""spa\"" is a hair salon, I'm not too fond of hair salons calling themselves a \""spa\"" just because they have a couple of massage and facial rooms, but whatever, we'll see how the staff is...\n\nWe both got massages first and I got the blind lady, Evon.  I read the other yelp reviews before heading in but I had also gotten massages by blind people in China, which were awesome, so I went in with an open mind.  She was nice and had a good energy but her technique was not refined.  Her strokes were short and clumsy and I don't think she even has a massage license (I didn't have the heart to ask).  She tried getting the pressure points, but missed, she didn't really know how to get rid of my huge shoulder knot and I kind of just wanted the massage to be over.  She was quick on each of the body parts and she had this kind of timer device that she checked periodically and when she realized that there's still plenty of time left, she would find a body part to massage.  It was like child's play massage.  When I left the room, her husband wasn't sitting out in the waiting area like another yelper had mentioned before, but he was in the salon because I heard him later on.\n\nSo there was some mix up with my appointment because instead of getting a facial right after my massage, I was taken in for my pedicure.  The lady, Tanya was a little off.  She didn't have me pick out my nail color first, and she had me soaking in the water too long because she had to finish up with someone else.  My feet were so pruney that I think she cut my skin while cutting my nails but it's hard for me to tell.  She didn't ask how I liked my nails cut and made them round when I like them square.  Her painting job was amateur to say the least, there's paint all over my cuticles and skin.  She was nice but I'm paying for a service to be done properly.  My paint job was better than this one, I'm really tempted to just remove the color so I can re-do it myself.  Tanya was also talking to me for so long that she didn't watch the time and we were going over.\n\nJulie then took me in for my facial and she was very polite and professional - she apologized for the mix-up, the regular receptionist is away getting married or something, so hence the confusion.  She also apologized for Tanya and also for her daughter that had come to hang out at the salon.  Julie's facial was good, she put me to sleep at one point, so that's a good sign.\n\nI like small businesses because 90% of businesses are small businesses, however, I don't like small businesses that doesn't focus on the customer - because, hello, that's who's paying the bills!  \nGotta cater to the customers so they will come back."

0,NEVER again am i going to this GHETTO ass club! A bachelorette party starting a fight?? Are you serious? What a joke. \n\nThe only cool thing about this club is that they played songs from Michael Jackson. Other than that...it's like any other club you might find in TJ.
3,"Great service and the waiter was always checking on us never had to look around for service. They use these new computers at your tables to order drinks, food, desserts etc. It was nice being able to press a button and have a drink refill within seconds. You can also pay your bill from the tablet at your table no need to wait for a check and them to return your slip and card to sign. Oh and they hooked it up on chips and salsa to go!!!"
1,"Ick.\n\nIt was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  \n\nIn retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a \""World Famous Gyro\"" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  \n\nUh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.\n\nGuess you get what you pay for...."
0,"Today I read a food critic's column in the Las Vegas Review Journal's NEON section which gave 4 A ' s to a new restaurant at Town Square, POT LIQUOR CAS. Wow, I thought! 4 A's. This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet! We eat out often and I've not ever felt so used and cheated."
0,"Wish I could have Yelp this place before taking my fiance here for a quick dinner. Lured by the giant golden fish tank, I was hopping this place will at least have a decent modern Chinese cuisine that equally match with its contemporary design. WRONG WRONG WRONG, The food is TASTELESS, OVERPRICED even though the service is the only one thing that is acceptable. I had the most Yucky Singapore style noodles and wonton soup in my life. SERIOUSLY, how could you go wrong with wonton noodles? This place seriously needs A NEW CHEF!"
3,"Great day spa with great massages.  Highly recommended.  Try the double massage, fantastic."
4,Honest and fair. The owner is the one who works on your car so you know he is serious about the business. Friendly and quick. It is a little pricey though.
0,"Stopped by this place during a recent Vegas trip after a few local cigar guys told me about it (they said it had a nice lounge)\n\nFirst, I am a person that travels with cigars, in part because I like good cigars, but I don't like to pay tourist trap prices.  But you don't walk into a cigar shop to smoke and not buy something, that's just bad form.\n\nThe humidor is tiny, about half of it is their custom rolled, the prices are higher than they should be (not Casa high, but more than MSRP and NV tax)\n\nWhat really got to me was they were filming something, and kept telling people sitting in the lounge that we needed to keep quiet so they wouldn't hear us on the tape.  When they stopped filming, the production staff was calling women to come in to be part of the crowd shots.\nA cigar lounge where they don't want you to talk?  Cigars are social, a lounge that you can't sit down and strike up a conversation with the other people around you?  Not a place I will go back to"
4,"First time to the Pizza Company while on a business trip on a Friday for the local Arms Gun show.\n\nHad a 12\"" margherita pizza and had them add a few mushrooms (small up-charge on price), as well.\n\nNoticed on the Yelp photos that the pizza were not \""burnt\""...so I knew to ask the staff to burn mine a bit.\n\nPizza is just not pizza unless you have some charring at the perimeter and the bottom of the crust.  It ads that burnt, smoked taste.\n\nThe crushed tomato sauce was excellent, fresh cheese and mushrooms are also excellent.  Basil is added the pizza comes out of the oven.\n\nPizza was great.  I did a take-out and walked the 2-3 minutes back to the nearby Hampton Inn.\n\nStaff was very friendly and wanted to make sure they did it right.  Before my pizza was boxed, they had me look it over.\n\nThe place is quaint, smallish..but they have enough seating for 20+ folks.  Clean and charming and quiet enough to have friends and be able to hear to talk.\n\nAlso got a piece of their tiramisu cake...which was also very, very good.  I let it come to room temp. before eating it.\n\nWhen back in Las Vegas, I will make the Pizza Co. my place for pizza cravings !"
2,"Experience:  Met a group of friends here for dinner. There was about 8 of us.  We got here at 6pm on a Thursday and we were the only patrons here. By the time we left two hours later, there were about 25 more people there. \n\nFacility:  This is a dark modern place, that has a rocky roll kinda feel. All the other patrons were dressed in black...not sure if that was s coincidence or not. They have about 12 TVs showing various movies and sporting events. Music is a mix and not too loud to have a good conversation. \n\nService:  we got a cool waiter who was friendly, informative and easy on the eyes. \n\nFood:  we ordered the cheese sticks to share and they were good.  They were homemade and came with a small portion of fries too. \nThen we got two pizzas to share. The white pizza with mushrooms and the green pizza with eggplant. \nThe white pizza was my fav of the two, but could have used something like chopped tomatoes or black olives to cut the richness of the cheese. \nThe green pizza had a pesto sauce that was good, but the eggplant was flavorless. \nI also tried two beers. One was the Troublesome Gose, which was a good one. \nThe other was the Bockor Vanderghinst. This one I really enjoyed.  It was a cross between grapefruit beer and a stout, but lighter. \n\nOverall:  I liked this place. I would definitely come back with some friends. Good atmosphere, decent food, a little pricey, and great staff."
