2,"Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. \n\nThis place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing, which I always am, (you do too. admit it) fried rice, steak, shrimp and white sauce (DUDE) then Kabuto is king of lunch options in my book. Always super clean and full of kindhearted staff. The parking lot is super difficult to get in and out of though. 51 traffic at lunch is a beast. Good luck getting stuck behind someone trying to cut across traffic at 12pm on a weekday. It's murder. This place would greatly benefit from another exit/entrance or a stoplight. Here's hoping....\n\nYou can't really shake a stick at balanced lunch when you can have soup or a salad, veggies, fried rice and a choice of a protein for under $10 and be back out the door and headed back to the office or meeting. Glad to see these guys have taken this into account. Though, you should know that the $10 offering mostly comes in the protein department. Some may require more steak or chicken, which can be sparse. \n\nService is always quick and friendly. They do a wonderful job of memorizing orders. Rarely has it come to pass that my order has been mal-delivered. Quick on refills and I love that they always offer a to-go beverage. \""Why, yes! I would love a diet coke to go! How thoughtful!\"" Pretty much always my thought process. \n\nThis place also does full dinner options and has sushi. Neither of which I have tried to date, but would happily oblige if the option was presented. \n\nThanks for the quick and entertaining lunch/service, Kabuto!"
4,Visiting here for 10 days and staying in a condo\nDriving around and found this place\nAte here 2x ( Lunch + Dinner)\nFood was fresh + Tasty\nSushi was great for the price\nShrimp OK but about the same as other buffets\nSesame balls were lite and great\nFor desert they had a coffee taramisu which was rather good
1,Terrible terrible food
4,"This is a beautiful theatre with a gorgeous glass front which is great for watching the world go buy while having a coffee.\n\nI have fond memories of coming to this theatre to see the ballet since I was very young. I rather distinctly remember on my 9th birthday vomiting on the stairs during a performance of Cinderella. Ahh memories.\n\nBut this theatre really is lovely. Its the sort of theatre that you get a little dressed up to go to, like people used to do back in the day. I was lucky enough to see a stunning performance of the Nutcracker here in January, which obviously is mostly attributed to Scottish Ballet but the theatre played a huge role also. Everything from the sound to the lighting was fantastic and it really was a magical evening. \n\nThere is a number of bars for you to have a quick tipple during the interval, but you have to be quick out your seat because it gets very busy fast. \n\nTickets can be expensive, but it really attracts some of the better quality shows so it is worth it and it really makes for a nice evening out."
3,"I don't quite get this place or why Asians love it, but it is very good :)"
4,"Holy cow, their food is outstanding, but their tortillas are the best in PHX, home of the best Mexican food in the US...that is saying a lot, I know, but please check them out for yourself. I'm going back to PHX soon for the first time since moving away, and Carolina's will be my first stop. I'm salivating just writing this review. Truly awesome!!!"
2,"We stayed here the night before my girlfriend's flight and didn't really know what to expect.  We were pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good business hotel!  I'll list the good and bad separately.\n\nGood:  The sheets were clean, the room was clean, the water was hot, the amenities were good for the price point and the beds were fairly comfortable.  Wifi was easy to connect to and signal was strong.\n\nBad:  We saw dozens of dogs in this hotel...I know people love their pets, but allowing pets in a hotel without proper fogging is just asking for flea problems, especially since most people let their pets on the bed.  Fortunately, we didn't have any problems with fleas. We DID have a problem with the night staff, though.  The clerk was nice enough, but the second lady (who did the cleaning, I suppose) has a SERIOUS attitude problem.  She was very rude to my Chinese girlfriend, who doesn't always pick up rapid English when it's not spoken directly to her.  We also heard this unpleasant woman tell our neighboring room that \""YOU DO NOT TELL ME TO GET YOU ANYTHING.  YOU TELL THE FRONT DESK AND SHE TELLS ME TO GET THEM.  THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. \""  All in a loud, echoing voice.  \n\nI suppose the breakfast was just OK.  Very light on meat and heavy on cheap carbs, but it was enough to get us out of the door in the morning.  We liked this hotel, but might avoid this particular La Quinta because of that lady.  After hours of driving, we want smiles and not rude barking from a staff member that rivals the dogs that bring fleas into the rooms....\n\nAlso of note:  You can reserve a room with a card, but you must ALSO let them put a hold on your card for the full room amount until checkout.  You can pay cash at checkout.  This wasn't explained to us until we were at the counter."
3,"Stopped back by Mellow Mushroom with my mate Justin from Brew Bros. & a few of our mates Monday afternoon while pub crawling on a day off.  \nFirst I must say my return trip was motivated by an immediate response from to my 1st Yelp review from Mellow Mushroom's owner Jay.  I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.\nThis can only be a good thing.\nThe same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. \nOur bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice.\nAll said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here."
2,Went for lunch to celebrate a grinding training finally ending. Burgers and drinks were good. I wish I had time to sit there and savor it. \n\nI will go again with kids which is the true test as we all know.
3,The drunken noodles..... Get them now. \n\nThe restaurant owner is very nice and you can tell he loves what he does. Now don't let the layout throw you. It may not be the fanciest but the noodles are goooood. We ll be back. \n\nPrice 3.5/5 average \nAtmosphere 3/5 \nFood 5/5
0,"They look full so I decided to give it a try.  People standing at a Panda Express set up line, order in a foreign language, so it is usually a good sign, that the food is authentic.  But when we order the sweet and sour pork, the lady behind the glass give us All fat pork.  A minute ago, I saw she spooned all lean pork from the same dish to a lady who obviously speak their language.  So that is a big turn-off, I am not coming back again."
0,"Visit was Friday, July 3rd around 5pm.  Tables were very sticky. All of them. Wanted inside and stuck us in an irritating spot next to a white cloth covering crates beneath a TV. Sangria was sour and not fruity. Paper towel dispenser was broken in restroom and area was very dirty.  Didn't have the corned beef and cabbage for \""signature\"" soup! NO Corned beef and cabbage in an Irish restaurant!!!  The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted moldy.  The clam chowder soup was too salty.  The soda bread  was tasteless and dry.  Shepherd's pie was too hot (definitely microwaved) and kind of bland although the meat was like chef boyardee.  Also, the decor was bad, everything they had hung was wrinkled. You can tell they don't really care. Waitress was ok. This place needs new management or someone from corporate to come here and see how terrible this place really is.  Will never return again, ever."
3,"Secret gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Interior is clean and inviting. Seating is pretty limited so expect to wait if you arrive during peak hours. Great Steak & Eggs or Steak sandwhich for $5.99, but it doesn't taste like it was $5.99. Service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name. My parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week. Nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food. Great prices, fantastic specials, and consistently good services. In a town like Vegas you can't beat that."
2,"Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away, but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza. \n\nI'll update the next time I am out there, but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games."
2,"Jupiter's is a fun place for families with younger kids, but it's not anything special for adults.  The food isn't spectacular, and the pizza is similar to Monical's thin crust pizza if you're curious what to expect.  There's a BIG arcade room with pool tables and video games, but this area gets PACKED if you go at a popular time of day.  I've only been to Jupiter's once, and I haven't really had the desire to go back.  The service was ok, but the atmosphere and food weren't anything special.  We also had a LONG wait to get a table and food."
1,"Cirque du Soleil prices without the Cirque du Soleil talent.  I kept waiting to be amazed by people doing things with their bodies that I can't do.  That's why I pay you the big bucks, people!  The costumes and music (of course) are fantastic, though."
3,"Enough variety for me. Only reason I go to buffet - Shrimp, Oysters, Sushi and Salmon. They had all of these, so I'm happy. If you are looking for a quality buffet, skip this one . It didn't look clean and I had my waitress sit on our side table facing us while we eat. Annoyed, but I don't care much. Total bill without drinks, with tax - $22.64. \n\nI will come back here again over Lin's. I won't bring guests here though!"
1,"If you're going long distances, use the Deuce (i.e. from the Strip to Downtown). Otherwise, it's a waste of time and you'd be better off calling a taxi.\n\nFirst, this thing moves incredibly slow, and I have no idea why. When I first took it, it was during heavy traffic, so I made excuses for the bus driver. But the next time, there was no traffic anywhere, and we still went the same speed.\n\nThe whole double decker set up is annoying. Many people carry bags or luggage and carrying them up and down those stairs takes a lot of effort. Plus, if the bus is crowded (which it usually is), you have to fight to get around everyone else. I can see how having the double decker might be thought of as a fun way to see the Strip, but the whole bus is covered in ads, so you're not getting a very good view.\n\nFinally, I didn't really like the way I was treated when I was trying to board. There was an employee at the bus stop that was instructing people how to get on the bus (is that normal?). He asked if I had a pass or something, and when I said I did not, he told me I couldn't get on! I had two dollars, so I wasn't sure what the problems was. He got slightly indignant and told me I could only board if I had exact change. Which I did.\n\nI can see how a lot of tourists are idiots and that guy probably does need to be there, but it pissed me off. I could read all the signs plastered all over the bus stop, not to mention all over the bus."
2,"Mary Coyle is some pretty good ice cream. i would write a longer review, but the history has been covered, and the atmosphere. \n\ni would like this place more, but purchasing ice cream to go afew times i have noticed i need to let it thaw for a month before i can actually eat it. it's frozen that hard. other then that this place is pretty cool. :P"
2,I was so excited to try this place out. I came here for dinner and it was grand opening. When we enter the staff was just sitting and one of them got up to assist up.  This place is clean and the staff was friendly. Very patient as we decided on what to order. I'm a huge fan of chow fun (fried thick rice noodles) so I went ahead and order that. My friend order sweet and sour chicken. Our food came out and timely manner. My noodles were very tough are hard to chew.  Which is not good start. They're suppose to be soft. Ugh I never had a bad chow fun. But I will go back and try it again. Might be their first day so well see. Beside that it was good. My friend like the sweet and sour chicken but he didn't like how it was prepared. They serve it with the sauce on the side. He preferred it came already sauced up. The price was great about $10 and under. They had a few dishes that were $10 and above. They also do lunch specials until 4pm. I will definitely try it again.
1,"Woodmans is the grocery store of the damned.  The produce is attrocious and nasty.  The lines are always way too long.  It seems dirty.  Its unpleasant in so many ways.  It takes forever to shop there.  Its cheap, but I'd rather pay a few extra cents for a more pleasant grocery store."
2,"This place is not bad but not that best place I've ever been.  We had stone crab claws and stuffed shrimp for apps, for dinner I had Chilean Sea Bass with pan fried corn. Apps were great and dinner was pretty good too. The bass was not the best piece of sea bass I've ever had but it wasn't the worse either. Now, that corn was crazy bananas good. If you don't get anything else, get the corn."
3,"With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok. \nAll in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive."
1,"This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied."
1,"What do you do when Coca is packed? Well, sadly, the answer for us didn't lie at Mauramori, as much as we've tried over the past year. \n\nThe food here is fine, but that's really it. It's a touch above what you would expect at a run-of-the-mill diner, but nothing more. \n\nThe coffee is probably Green Mountain or whatever bulk option you'd expect to have somewhere that doesn't care too much about it. There are no fresh juices or other creative beverage options that can enhance your breakfast.\n\nThe deal breaker for us was the apathetic speed of service. The servers are friendly, it just seems like they have no urgency to do anything. Our food routinely came out 10 minutes later than expect all while the place wasn't even full."
3,"Food was delicious, portions were great, and price was very reasonable! Highly recommend"
4,"Incredible service and attention to detail. Each person in our group of 4 was thrilled with their manicures. Peter and his crew are perfectionists and artists, and are committed to what they do. \n\nIt was my twin sisters' birthdays, and they both received a complimentary bottle of wine! We're not from Vegas, but this will be a part of our itinerary every trip!"
0,"Susan started out great and helped with my green pool problem.  Then she stopped coming and did not return my calls or texts.  I paid Susan for a month, and possibly a month and a half for which I got no service.  When I asked for my money back I did not get a reply."
0,"We live nearby and thought it would be great to try a local dental office.  Both times my husband and I went in the dental hygienist talked, and talked, and talked to the point of annoyance.  Also, the dentist informed my husband that he needed a considerable amount of work done.  We waited a year (finances!) and went back to our prior dentist - listed in the Phoenix Magazine's \""Top Docs\"" - only to find that NO WORK was necessary or even recommended."
2,"It's hard to complain about this place given the price I got it for! \n**Warning** This is a long review, there is a lot to break down.\n\nB -- S\n-- Grandparents have an Interval International timeshare so they booked this place for a week for me\n-- 2 br suite really means 2 adjointed rooms (1 being a jr suite & the other being a regular suit w/ patio)\n-- Located about 10 mins from The Las Vegas Strip\n-- Plenty of free parking and shaded spots\n-- 24 hour pool, say what! BBQ grills available for use\n-- Exercise room\n-- Free shuttle\n-- Paid wireless $10 - $30 (I forget the exact price for how much)\n\nOK, so this place isn't the \""gem of Las Vegas.\"" Let's just put that out there! For what it is, it's actually a decent place. My Grammie got me a 2 bedroom suite for a week for under $400. If you can find a place to sleep 6 - 10 people for that amount, let me know! And if it's in old town Las Vegas, no thank you. You can see the sign as you drive down Tropicana, just hang a left and there it is on the left side.\n\nSo let's talk about service. The front desk was very friendly, let us check in a little bit early. And took care of anything we needed but let me tell you I've done Las Vegas more than a few times, so my group didn't need much. Housekeeping happens like after a few days so we checked in Tuesday and got our rooms cleaned on Friday/Saturday. In addition to cleaning our rooms, we received plenty of towels, blankets, pillows on demand.\n\nThe room was decent. It's not the Ritz Carlton by no means. My GF & I shared the single jr suite room. It had a decent size closet, dresser, & bathroom. The bathroom was cool, nothing special. The shower did have a nice size bathtub so you could take a relaxing bath. Our toilet clogged up but they sent someone right up and it was good for the rest of the week. The bed was pretty comfortable, pillows and blankets better than a cheap motel. The AC worked awesome and kept both of the rooms very cool. It was nice to have a mini kitchen with a fridge for our stuff and a sink. We also had cups and plates. I was pretty pleased with the room in general.\n\nOur friends shared the adjointed room next door. It had almost a full kitchen with oven and microwave, a dining table plus sofa sleeper. The balcony patio was cool but it faced the road instead of the pool. The full size fridge came in handy for supplies and food. Oh yeah, washer and dryer plus complimentary laundry soap! We all did some laundry!\n\nThe pool was NOT very clean. The hot tub had a whole crap load of leaves in there. I wasn't impressed with the pool but the 24 hours was nice. We didn't really take advantage of it though.\n\nThe exercise room was decent. It had a stationary bike, treadmill and stairmaster (I think). It also had a full body work out machine that you could do all the basic exercises with weights. They do stock towels there for you and your sweat which was nice.\n\nHonestly since I had a rental car, the distance from the strip was just fine. If I wanted to do Las Vegas on the strip with no rental car, I wouldn't stay here. My friends used the shuttle and you're not getting anywhere fast on that thing. In addition it takes a while to get from point A to point B. \n\nAll in all I would rate this place at around 3.5 stars. It's better than an average motel and it's pretty cheap and decent! I will say that I didn't really hear any neighbors or anything but I wasn't in my room from 7pm to 7am, lol. I was in Las Vegas for the Electronic Daisy Carnival!"
2,"Not worth it. Only upside is there weren't too many people there. For such a nice hotel, the food was off. They did have crabs but everything else was alright. Servers were attentive but like I said, weren't too many people. Maybe since it was a weeknight and after the holidays. I'd spend the extra few bucks and dine at Aria, The M, or Cosmo."
2,"I like the reasonably priced, reliable and tasty black bean burrito (the \""Wilmar\"") with its fresh avocado inside.  Too much noise and hubbub though to eat it there during the rush- better as take out."
1,"Service has always been great, don't care for the dry bread but it's the horrible water that stands out as trying to get the customer to order a \""drink\"". Out of the four of us at dinner we all agreed the water tasted like chlorine water from someone's pool. The server said it's \""filtered\"". NOT a chance! We asked him if we could get the water from bartender. He replied \""it's the same\"". He kept pushing ordering a $4 sparkling water or cocktail etc. We all agreed no thanks. I went up to the bar later and asked for a glass of water. What do you know? It was fine and definitely filtered. Food is alright but when the water tastes better at even In and Out or any other restaurant you know they aren't paying attention to detail. Plenty of other great Italian restaurants on Bell Rd."
3,"I have only been to MADCAP once, to see \""Until the Light Takes Us\"" - a documentary about KVLT Norwegian Black Metal. I am very excited to have a theater playing REAL independent films and cult classics nearby. I frequently visited Chandler Cinemas to see films put on by Midnight Movie Mamacita - Cannibal Holocaust, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Re-animator, Black Christmas.. etc. I was very disappointed to see that theater go. When I found out that she'd been relocated to continue the tradition at MADCAP, I rejoiced. I look forward to seeing many movies here in the future."
4,"This place is delicious! You can mix their tonkatsu with as many sesame seeds as you want. I ordered the Katsu donburi. They brought out a huge bowl of rice, egg and pork tonkatsu. It even comes with miso soup! The miso soup even has a rich taste. The bowl is very filling as well. They even check up on us on how the food was. I'm definitely coming back here!"
0,"Ummm...Lainie B. or Larnia B. needs to take this rating as constructive criticism and do something about it, instead of calling me names and posting it on Yelp. If you can't handle the criticism, hunny, learn to give good service. I guess Man vs. Food did a good job featuring the crawfish, but not the employees!"
0,"Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. \n\nI do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get."
1,I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill
3,"I am a frequent customer of this establishment and I appreciate the quality of their beer and the consistency of good service in the bar area. I have only dined in the main seating area twice, and one time it resulted in a beer bath for my wife and infant son but hey, que sera sera right? My overall experience with GB has been positive. Food is good quality but overpriced in my opinion. I tend to take advantage of their happy hour specials if possible. I have had a couple snafus regarding my order, one in particular where my dinner salad came after the entree, but they comped the salad and apologized, no big deal. My go to brew is the hefeweizen, you will not be disappointed with its banana-clovey smoothness. Cheers!"
2,"If you like guns this is your place. I didn't know if I would like guns or not and found out I don't. We went on a Monday morning which meant no lines no wait. I got the ladies package which included 10 rounds of a handgun and 10 rounds with a pink ak-47 and a free t-shirt.\n\nThey give you headphones and eye glasses. The instructor was nice, cautious, knowledgeable, and gave me a few minutes of instructions on how to shoot each. They also let you choose your target. I was defintely scared as crap upon hearing the guns go off and really didnt' want to finish. But I did and was proud of myself at the end. My husband loves this place, its really popular to visit."
0,They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.\n\n\nThe waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.\n\nI will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.
2,"Burger Bar is just ok. The veggie burger option isn't tasty. I'd much prefer a Boca Burger over Burger Bar's version. The menu describe the veggie burger as \"" This burger will flirt with your taste buds and delight your palate with its intriguing combination of whole grains, brown rice, onions, soy, cheese, mushroom, garlic and special spices.\"" Um, no. More like mushy rice mess that sends my taste buds packing. \n\nThe sweet potato fries are delicious. One of the people in our party ordered the kobe beef/foie gras burger (aka Rossini), which was just ok. I seriously doubt it was worth the $60 price tag, but it came with a free dessert. We chose the chocolate burger, which is a warm donut (as the bun) with chocolate ganache as the meat patty and a slice of jellied passionfruit as a cheese slice. This was awesome. I would come back JUST for the dessert burgers."
0,"I've been coming to the restaurant regularly for the past week. The food is delicious, definitely recommend Kao Mun Kai Tod. The food deserves a better review but it is the horrible customer service that made me give this restaurant a one star.\n\nI came in for lunch and it was very busy, so I decided to wave at the waiter and said \""excuse me\"". The man with attitude came up to me mocking my waving gesture and said \""I can see you and you don't have to do that\"". This is the first time in my life I've ever seen a waiter getting offended because a customer tried getting their attention by waving and saying excuse me. As a customer I must say I was truly offended, Mr. Attitude came to pick up the menus after we have ordered our food. As a concerned customer I reminded him that his job was a waiter and that's not the attitude he should have. \n\nAfter speaking to a lady who appears to be the manager, she told me something along the line that \""waving to a waiter is unacceptable in Britain and this is not how it works around here\"". I then apologized to her for losing my temper at their employee and came to a conclusion that customer service is non existence in this particular restaurant. It's a shame. Really."
0,"We were staying at the Luxor and figured we would try the buffet. Big mistake...the food was gross, there was not much of a variety, and the salad bar looked like the veggies had been there since the previous night. \n\nThe only good thing about the buffet was our server who was so nice and attentive."
3,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with liquor stores, but have always been pleased here.  The staff are always nice, helpful, and non-intrusive.\n\nI once went with my boyfriend, who expressed a desire for a certain beer that they didn't have.  The dude behind the counter immediately said that they would order it.  Lo and behold, the next time we went, there it was.  We proceeded to buy lots of it.  Everything after that is kind of a blur."
0,"Not sure why it's called a cantina. The bar had 8 different tequilas. I asked the Bartender why they didn't have the shelves stocked and her reply was they were cutting back on tequila?????\nI ordered a burger that was advertised as a 1/2 pound burger. I ordered it and to be cooked medium rare.\nWell, when the burger was delivered the patty of mystery meat appeared to have been 1/4 lb at best before cooking, surely not a 1/2 lb burger and it was cooked well done. This was our 2nd time dining and it will be our last. From the looks of the selection on the shelves and the fact that we were the only one's there for lunch they appear to be another doomed restaurant. excuse me Cantina"
3,"the arizona burger gets the extra star here- it's wonderfully spicy. other than that, it seems like big specialty burgers that are good but not great"
2,"SkinnyFats is located in an awkward, small office park on Dean Martin near Sunset with minimal parking and minimal space inside, so if you're planning on a weekday lunch be prepared for a bit of a crowd and nowhere to park. The restaurant is equally small but colorful with just a handful of two- and four-top tables, and maybe ten seats facing a high counter along the window. There are veggies and animals painted all over the walls, with fun metal corrugated ceiling tiles. It's a loud, lively space, and gets a bit hectic when it's crowded. The menu has a healthy and unhealthy side, both filled with quite a number of items for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On the healthy side you will see juices, snacks, gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches. On the unhealthy side, or happy side as they call it, you have choices of shakes, waffles, snacks, sandwiches, and more. There seems to be plenty of options for whatever you're looking for, and I'll certainly have to stop back in to try some more.\n\nSo as usual I came for one thing, and in this case it's their Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2lb angus burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg and SF sauce. What came out looked great, but was kind of like the Rollin' Smoke burger I ate a few weeks ago; too damn large to properly enjoy. There's something to say of the spectacle, but the oversized assembly makes for a slightly inedible burger. The moment I picked it up and gave it a squeeze I could tell the bun might be a bit dry. The patty was sticking out from the edges of the bun so I was able to sample it on its own; it was of good quality and cooked well. The bun was indeed a bit too dry, and on first bite a bit too thick as well, but the burger quickly got messy so I saw the need for something with a bit more substance. The egg had good flavor but got a bit lost in everything, there was tons of cheese that had good flavor, although some of it still wasn't melted by the time it got to my table. The lettuce was prominent and proportionally just enough, and the pickles were also good. I knew the avocado was there because a few slices fell out, but I couldn't taste it within the burger with all those other flavors mixed in. If this burger was simplified and you could properly sample some of the intended flavors it could be really great, but there is just far too much going on to enjoy this. Does any burger really need a fried egg, onion, pickles, avocado AND a sauce? I guess many people would argue that this is what a burger is all about, but for me it's a bit much. Oh and as for that sauce, I don't even know what it tasted like, and for me that's the problem.\n\nThe truffle fries on the other hand were really good; almost all of them were cooked well and they were very flavorful. I found myself eating them well after my giant burger was done. Again, I feel like I have to defend myself with my slight disappointment; a massive burger is a great thing, but when you add too many toppings they start to cancel each other out. Maybe the solution is choosing only one or two of their offered toppings, which could provide a slightly simplified and very flavorful burger. For $10.50 with fries this really isn't a bad deal, I just found it to be a few too many items piled together. Still, the menu looks great, and all the food looks to be of very good quality, so I'll surely be back to try other items soon."
3,"Thai is one of my favorite cuisines - it has a unique and delicate balance of spice with flavor. Siam Thai just nails it with its signature Pad Thai. It's one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had. I'd also recommend  the Iced Thai Tea, as it's is a great accompaniment to the meal. The Panang Curry is also good, though, not the best.\n\nThe restaurant isn't exactly in the most \""happening\"" places of Glendale, but the decor is tastefully done - distinctive elephant shaped chairs, for example, complete with Thai music. \n\nThe service was good and prompt., and can be even better if they have more waiters. \n\nIn summary, if you like Thai, you'll love Siam Thai!"
0,"I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around."
1,"Their service is comparable to the local hole in the wall, and my local Chinese place has better tasting food (MSG anyone?). I truly felt like I was in main land China since, none of their staff members spoke English properly (except for the hostess). \n\nOverall the food was mediocre, though the spare ribs were pretty good but the services and food were overly priced. It would have been nice to have a full bar instead of being told that we should go across the hall to Emeril's ..."
1,"Not that great, very busy and it seemed every store I entered was out of what I was looking for.  Parking is horrible as well.  I don't plan on ever going back to this place.  I gave it two stars instead of one since the misters are nice in the summer."
3,Nice place to hang out and grab some food and drink.  I like to sit at the bar.  My favorite is the hot chick chicken sandwich.  I love their skinny crispy fries.
3,The atmosphere and ambience here is unbelievable. Elegant and classy with a distinctive southwestern look and feel.I started off with French Onion soup. Great flavor and aroma.  I had the porterhouse. A good cut that was seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium rare. A nice side of mixed sauces accompanied the steak.The fries I ordered were the only weak point of the meal. I expected hand cut steak fries and got what seemed to be overdone frozen Ore-Ida shoestring fries. Oh the house bread was killer. Individually baked buttery brioche loaves with a touch of sea salt on to. I was stuffed and passed on dessert but the cappuccino was top notch. Servers friendly and on point from start to finish.
4,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!\n\nThis is the third time we've gone and have to say that from start to finish, everything is tasty fresh and the atmosphere is really great.  Hubby and I could probably eat here every weekend.  We took the kids last night (big sushi eaters) and this is their favorite place too.\n\nWe always start with the Edemame 3 ways - So good.  Its ot your run of the mill edemame.  One is lightly tossed in a southwest spice salt, one is in a soy type marinade and the 3rd is in a spicy aioli.  It lasted maybe 5 minutes.  We then asked to try the Crab Puffs - WOW.  They came right out of the fryer and were really hot but we were all burning ourselves to try and eat them because the taste was so good.\n\nSecond round consisted of their Bonzai sashimi's.  We ordered double orders of all three - Seared Tuna, Yellowtail. and Salmon.  They are all very different and the marinades plus the different salads they came with really compliment the sashimi.  The Seared Tuna is coated with ground pepper in a soy type sauce.  The salmon is paired with finely diced apples and nuts, and the yellowtail has a very thinly slided jalapeno plus another awesome sauce.  All 3 double orders were eaten so fast, not even our waiter Summer could believe it.\n\nFor rolls, we ordered the Southwest Ceviche, the Desert Rose (YUM), the Desperado (Yum with a little heat), the Vegas Roll (AWESOME) and the crowd pleaser the Country Fried Chicken Roll.  It seems a little wrong to be eating a non-sushi type roll in a sushi restaurant (we're a bit purist at times) but you can't help loving that roll -- served with a BBQ sauce you want to bath in...\n\nMartini's are great and my favorite is the Sheso Sexy (get it???) - it tastes like a cherry kiddie drink.  Hubby loves the Dirty Harry (Dirty Martini) which was really perfectly balanced.  \n\nI have no idea what the bad reviews were about - and if any of that did happen you should try this place again.  I have always found the waitstaff to be really really attentive - Summer has taken care of us 2 or 3 times and she's great.  They will take care of you will good food, good drink and good times.  I'm not a 5 star type person but this place really deserves it.  \n\nOne of the plaques on their wall had a great saying that I leave you with:  \""Man who steals wife's sushi gets no piece at home\""   Remember that, gentlemen!!"
4,"One of THEE best places to eat in Madison, for sure. It can be a bit loud inside, but who cares. The food and drinks are so delicious. The upstairs bar is very quaint and spacious. Support this bar, it is SO worth it!"
1,"The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again."
4,"Dr. Savitsky and her staff are simply amazing. Very stress free environment, made me feel like part of the family.\nI had 2 crowns and a filling in a single visit. \nMy former Dentist had trouble numbing me up, Dr. Savitsky had no problem.\n I'm glad the office staff is considerate enough of the patients that manage ou to get to our appointments on time. \nI highly recommend this office to everyone I know.\nI wish I could give more then five stars!"
1,"Wow. Now I remember why I never cared much for Butterfield's. We had a good experience about a month ago, motivating us to return. Today, our experience could best be described as stressful.\n\nWe checked in early on a Sunday, largely beating the rush. As a party of six, however, we still had a 25 minute wait. Not bad. A half hour came and went, so we checked to see how much longer it would be. They indicated we had already been seated. Quite a surprise to us as you can imagine. \n\nWe were promised we would be next. Another 25 minutes came and went. Another large party was seated. Then, finally, us. Without apology. \n\nService was adequate. The specialty pancakes were fine, but two omelets we ordered were quite disappointing. \n\nA simple genuine apology for the seating screw up would have gone a long way. Or at least then serve us something exceptional.  Treating customers so poorly, whether a result of complacency or arrogance, is how seemingly invincible restaurants like Butterfield's find a path to failure."
3,You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!
1,We came for dessert.  The kids liked their sundae and shake.  They were not very tasty to me...the chocolate shake had a strange cinnamon after taste.  My German chocolate cake just made me sad.  Blech.  The server was very nice.  But I won't be back.
0,Where is Eddie or Eddy????? I will not come here any longer if Eddie is not available. To the point a rude service. Technician never looked me in the eye and was turned away from me joking and yakking it up with her colleagues. \nThe place looked like a bomb went off. \nI have been getting decent to good service till now. But this will be the end if Eddy is not available.\nAlso: everyone of the technicians picks up or checks their personal phone.... While working on your feet or hands.
0,"It's sad that once I logged on to leave a review I see the 5 star review I left one year ago for this place. It used to be my favorite until Saturday night. We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is \""very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour\"" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, \""Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?\"" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh. What's really bad about it is we're locals so when the tourists aren't there who does she think Le Thai is serving?"
1,"I had lunch here Thursday. I have eaten here before and loved it but this time, not sure I would go back. The waitress came over to take our order and when I said I was going to order a salad but looked down at the menu she quickly said she had another table and would come back. Off she went. We had our water glasses refilled. The gal filled one glass over the top of one of our handbags, a Prada. She didn't seem to care and almost apologized as she casually went to get at towel but didn't hand us one. We cleaned up the water on the outside and inside of the handbag with our napkins. After searching for and flagging down the waitress to order our lunch, I ordered the mixed greens salad with turkey. The salad was ok but the turkey appeared to be packaged sliced lunch meat chopped into squares. It was awful. The bread on the salad was extremely tough and chewy. As we were eating, we watched, who I think was the manager, clean the lights over the bar as people sat there eating their lunch. The dust was flying everywhere and also landed on the bar. From our table we could see the dust because the bar was higher.  She didn't wipe the bar off but rather went around and began inspecting the clean glasses. One man was sitting there with his lunch and a glass of water. She cleaned the light next to him anyway. There also seemed to be something going on between two of the gals in the dining area. Not impressed this time around."
4,Stopped in here today for a quick cut. After reading many other yelp reviews (all 5 stars) I figured I would give it a try. Got exactly what I asked for and for a great price too! Will definitely be going here from now on.
1,"First time at a cicis, not impressed. We paid the extra $8 for their garlic parmasan and buffalo wings...they were not very good, for the quality, they should, have been included in the buffet.  Good place for kids to eat a slice but not much of a selection."
4,Best chicken in town love this place I eat here about twice a week definitely recommend it to all my friends =)
3,"World of Beer has a selection that goes on for days! We didn't get food this time, but will definitely return to try some - the pretzel they have looks amazing! We stopped in for some drinks on the 4th of July and were pleased with the service and atmosphere.  This is a great place on Mill Ave. for people watching and great drinks!"
2,"The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. The salsa tasted like spicy tomato soup, the tortillas were hard, but I had a veggie fajita and they brought out beef, I am vegan so had to ask for just veggies but when the veggies came out they were good lots of variety, broccoli, squash, zucchini, and mushrooms."
4,This place was soo much fun. The food was delicious. Bobby the singer was wonderful and made my girlfriends night. Definitely will come back
1,"The fried chicken and sides are pretty good, however the overall wait time subtracts from my star rating.  I've visited this location twice since it has opened and the wait time really isn't worth it.  My first visit resulted in about a 1.5 hour wait and the order was incorrect, so the final wait time was close to 2 hours.  My second visit on 08/19/12 was approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.  During the second visit on a Sunday there was only one register open and nearly 100 people in line.\n\nThis is a good place to grab dinner after winding down a long shopping trip, but it's not somewhere that you can run to and pick up a quick bite.  Since Popeye's is considered fast food and not Gordon Ramsey's steak in Las Vegas, I have to give it a low rating, because \""who would wait over an hour in line at a McDonalds or Burger King?\"".\n\nI'll give the place 6-8 months for the hype to calm down and then I'll return and update my review."
0,"I had a pretty good time at this place soon after it opened.  The music was really good.\n\nCut to a year later- I spent 6 months planning my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas.  We went all out.  I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table.  The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name.  This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird.  Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation.  I called the idiot I booked with and he finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry.  No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about.  I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas!  I trusted this place to take care of us, we got f**ked. \n\nNow I am planning my cousins big birthday weekend.  Do you think I will suggest Tryst?"
3,"I don't got to school at UNCC but discovered the gardens because I was looking for something outdoorsy, safe, and active to do while I was visiting the area for work and looking for some true beauty in the middle of stripmall-landia.  What a find and worth the effort to find and take the time to relax and enjoy the beauty of a simple walk on a hidden path in a busy campus!\n\nAlthough many plants are not in season (I visited in January, many plants were in hibernation), the botanical gardens, per my interpretation, are designed as series of walking paths that capture natures essence from various perspectives.  The effect is calming, relaxing, and purifying, regardless if you're a traveler searching out something different, or a student seeking solace, refuge, or even just a moment of calm in the midst of a hectic class schedule."
3,"Everything you need is here.\n\nWe stayed here on a stagette because the bride has seen \""The Hangover\"" way too many times. Actually, I never asked her why this hotel... but she insisted that we stay here. I am glad she did because it seriously has everything you want... It's smoking hot in August (duh) so being somewhere with a decent nightclub, a bunch of restaurants, shopping, a beautiful pool, a convenience store... seriously, if need be, I wouldn't have had to venture outside.\n\nWe had booked a room in the Forum Tower. When we arrived, they upgraded us to the Palace Tower. Woot woot. Much bigger room with two washrooms. Perfect for three girls. If we were on a higher floor, we would have had a view of the pool. I think I saw the top of Snackus Maximus. I wish we had a fridge for our use since ours was filled to the brim with mini-bar regulars. But we had ice... after getting vodka and mixers from the store in the lobby, we were able to imbibe in the room. \n\nWe spent a lot of time in the room since we spent a lot of time in the hotel. It was just so easy to pop upstairs to grab something or to drop off our shopping before coming back down to play the Big Buck Hunter slots. We wandered to Spago's in the Forum Shops before dancing the night away at Pure. \n\nUtter convenience."
4,Perfect for the locals to avoid the hectic crowd and pricing of other theaters at the casinos.  No need to park at  a casino and pass through it to find the theater.
1,"Sleep Poet Antique Mall is big, and they have a lot of different kind of things.  However, the great items and great bargains appear to be few and far between, which is a huge turn-off for me.  Overall, I give it about a 2.5.\n\nYou could spend probably hours here looking at all their wares.  They offer a wide selection of items, from jewelry, furniture, clothes, decorations, records, books, dishes, and other random kitchen items (and much, much more).  The place is filled with little \""booths,\"" which I am assuming is either an attempt to group types of items together or are all owned by one person/business.  It's fairly easy to navigate your way around the store from booth to booth.\n\nOn the weekends, this place is crazy.  People are packed in here, and parking becomes quite difficult.  It is also difficult to find reasonably-priced, good items here.  Because the store is so large, it's quite time-consuming to take the time to find a good bargain.  Most of the wares they offer seem overpriced, with many of them in serious disrepair.  Just because it's \""old\"" does not always mean it's an antique.  \n\nI would probably go check it out again, but definitely not on a weekend.  I am not a fan of large crowds, and this place can definitely get very crowded.  That being said, this a great place for people who long for a good bargain hunt.  If you don't mind a bit of a crowd, and you are the sort of person who loves to wade through things for an awesome bargain, this is probably the place for you.  I'm definitely sad that I am far too impatient for this type of place, because I've seen people walk away with some nice stuff."
2,"This place is all about convenience.\n\nIt is convenient to grab a drink while friends are waiting in line.\nIt is convenient to get a refill as you walk from hotel to hotel.\nTherefore (no suprise) it is conveniently over priced.\n\nI appreciate the craft beers - some of my favs on tap, Fat Tire, Mirror Pond, Moose Drool. And I do appreciate that you can people watch like CRAZY at this spot, but I wouldn't stay and hang out. I will however be grabbing a drink ever so often as I stroll by."
1,"To your left you'll see a rock that looks like a dinosaur and to your right you'll see a rock that looks like a person.  Sometimes you'll see some real animals, but not today...  \n\nReally? Is that all you've got.  Maybe we just didn't luck out, but our tour guide was horrible.  Not witty, not funny, not even that interesting.  He was clearly reading from a script because at one point he lost his place or got confused or something and ended up re-reciting the entire opening three minutes, word for word.  Most of the time he just but on a soundtrack, which clearly was way too short for the entire 90 minute tour since we listened to the Titanic song 4 times.  As a side note, you may not want to remind people of a huge boat accident when we're doing a boat tour... but that's just me.  \n\nDefinitely something for the older crowd, but even they seemed restless after about 45 minutes."
0,"Came in and asked for a table and of the 15 tables, 2 were occupied and maybe 7 had dirty dishes on them. I was told I'd have to wait or go to the bar.  Retarded right? Fine.  I go to the bar and wait 5 minutes to get attention.  Meanwhile i witnessed about 5 dishes getting cold in the window waiting to get picked up.  I looked around and there were more than enough employees but they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off. \n\nI order beef red curry with no basil or mint leaf. 15 min later I get beef red curry with basil all over the sumbitch.  I returned it with no apology...not even a smile.  In fact, I didn't catch a smile since I had walked in.  Service with a smile?  Nuh uh. Shitty service, no smile.\n\nNow for the food...eh.  Yeah.  Whatevs.  \n\nSo...my first time here:\nShitty service\nMessy dining room\nNo smiles (like they didn't want customers)\nAnd the food was just ok\n\nBad day at the office?  Naw man...they broke too many industry rules.  I'm out!  And i definitely ain't coming back."
4,"What can I say. I loved this store.  It was a little pricey but it's really a MUST to visit.   You can personalize a bag of M & M's for anything you want them to say.  Also, you have to see the 3D movie which is free on the top level.   It's only 10 to 15 min long but sooo worth it  whether you're a kid or an adult."
4,Just go walk down it. You'll see.
4,"Item are cleaned and ready as scheduled, they offer inexpensive but quality work, and decent hours of operations.\n\nNote, there is a drive through for those of you with children!"
2,"Yes, I'm a foodie. Yes, I was reared in the pastoral Driftless Zone, home to some of the best dairy in Dairyland. Yes, I am quite fond of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream (which, in Madison, is carried here and only here).  However, the customer service here runs the gamut from distracted to disinterested to downright rude. \n\nI stop in maybe twice a month.  Fromagination carries a plethora of hard-to-find artisanal and gourmet food items.  The charcuterie offerings are spare, which was a bit of a letdown, but they do boast a decent variety of beautifully displayed and properly packaged cheese (though it's not as extensive as I'd expect--despite Fromagination's artful arranging I'd venture a guess that Whole Foods' selection is nearly equivalent and less pricey). I just can't handle the counter staff.  I think it mainly stems from a time this winter where a gentleman was asking to taste a few cheeses-- he was putting together a cheese platter, he said, and wasn't quite sure where to start.  After he asked to taste a few cheeses, and was peering into the case, the woman behind the counter sighed loudly, put a hand on her hip, and said \""Are you actually going to buy some cheese, or are you just trying to get free samples?\"" The man was flabbergasted (as were all of us in the store) and stammered, \""Ma'am, I'm having a dinner party for some of my professors, and I really wanted to impress them with a nice cheese plate.  But I guess I'll take my business elsewhere.\"" Clearly embarrassed, he turned and walked out.  \n\nThat's the most extreme example I've witnessed (though on separate occasions I've heard people say \""I have money to spend here...\"" as they stood, stymied by the lack of attention) but it exemplifies the general vibe pretty well.  With the marked exception of one kind older man who is patient and helpful when I'm there, the cheesemongers at Fromagination seem aloof and haughty.  I often dread going in even if I need something that I can only get there, because I feel very pressured to purchase lest they think I'm merely sampling the wares.  Also, I generally have a good idea of what I want to buy-- but sometimes they'll steer me away from it! \""This is a very hard cheese.  Are you sure that's what you want?\"" Yes. I know that Vintage Van Gogh cheese basically crumbles to the touch.  I also know that its nutty, caramel flavor is exactly what I want.  Thanks!  \n\nI will keep going to Fromagination, especially because the shop takes great pains to promote local/regional cheese makers, but I hope they consider the constructive criticism and perhaps start having fun with the idea of selling cheese."
3,the food has great presentation but the decor is drabby and needs to be more lively with more style. the tuna poke was excellent as well as the cookie with ice cream. i would go back for more food to enjoy.
3,"Absolutely love this place!! We have been going here for about 4 years (since we moved to this side of town). The staff had always been very friendly and helpful. The owner in particular is very nice and remembers us every time we come in and actually tries to get to know us. The food is delicious, especially for the price. We bring all our friends and family who come to visit here. Only downside is that the location is a bit small and gets quite busy on the weekends but thankfully pick up orders are never a problem! Totally recommend this place!!"
1,Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  \n\nShort order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.  They were just warm. This place needs to do a better job!
4,"This food was seriously delicious. I hate to say it but i am seriously \""craving\"" one of their bowls right now. The flavors are well done and their products are fresh. If you want a healthy and delicious meal, you need to here. They have tons of gluten free options, vegetarian and vegan dishes for all of your dietary needs. Head on over!"
0,"I've had a variety of experiences with Green Cab, ranging from average to terrible. \n\nTonight, a Friday night, I called a cab at 9:50pm to take me from one end of downtown to the other. Yes, a decently busy time to call, but nothing out of the ordinary. Although I'm willing to wait 15-25 minutes on a Friday night, I'm not willing to wait 50 minutes. By that point, your energy is exhausted from the frustration of waiting. \n\nIn general, Green Cab kind of blows. Yes, they have eco-friendly cars and sweet ipads, but that's really not what I want in a cab service. I'd rather have a short wait time or a reliable estimate if it's a busy period. With Green Cab, there's really no telling when they'll arrive. \n\nI've also had trouble paying on several occasions. Some of the drivers enjoying pulling the old \""my machine is broken\"" when you try to pay with credit cards, while others claim not to have any change for your $20. You're a cab driver. Your only responsibility is to drive, accept credit cards, and be able to make change. If you're missing 2 of those 3, you're doin' it wrong. \n\nAlso, if you're waiting for Green Cab and want to see where your cab is, forget it. Rather than placing your call on a hold line, Green Cab routes calls to a busy signal, so you're SOL in terms of following up when it's busy. \n\nOther than that, Green Cab is awesome. \n\nAll in all, I'd stick with Union Cab. You *might* pay more, but it's worth it. Plus, the drivers are way cooler. One even had Cash Cab-style questions ready to ask me at 3am. But maybe you're not into Cash Cab. So then there's always Green Cab."
4,"Love, love, love this spot!  One of my favorite things about staying at Planet Hollywood is being so close to Earls.  This delicious sandwich spot is open 24 hours... How convenient!\n\nSanwiches- I've tried most sandwiches on the menu and they've all been amazing.  They're always hot, fresh, and delish.  My personal favorites are the chipotle chicken and veggie sandwich. \n\nWraps- They're fresh but nothing as tasty as the sandwiches.\n\nSalads- Small in size, but tasty. Try the Cobb.\n\nBaked Goods- ahhhh.... The cookies are moist and rich.  Although I'm usually a huge fan of chocolate chip cookies, the sugar cookie was my favorite in this case.  \n\nDon't let the long line discourage you!  They move pretty quickly, especially during the day."
2,"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant. Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment. \n\nThe food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28.  Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).\n\nFor my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help.  A mediterranean/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to. \n\nAnother suggestion, I saw that the owner felt  it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like \""I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.\""\n\nI'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.  I think once this place figures out exactly who they are, they can succeed."
3,"I SO want to give this place 5 stars.  Friendly, delicious and great prices.  \n\nBut...I just can't do 5 stars for a vegan restaurant where the employees hang out outside smoking.  Because now when I order buffalo hummus or yummy grape leave dolmas, I can't help but wonder if the employee just lit up on her break, and grabbed my tahini with nicotine-stained-smokey fingers.  Yuk.  Smoking + cooking?  It's a deal-breaker. Smoking + cooking at a vegan restaurant? Seems like an SNL skit."
0,"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!\n\nHygiene,  hygiene,  hygiene! \n\nI'm writing about the horrific hygiene at this place.   One of the servers was putting on her lipstick and lip liner at the hostess/check in station,  handles plates and silverware.  \n\nI'm walking to our table I see another lady sneeze into her hands with both hands cupped.  Didnt wash her hands, just started fixing her her eyeliner with her finger tips.   I told my wife, \""oh my gosh  hope this person isn't serving peple\"", and then she walks up to our table and introduces herself stating that she will be our waitress.   I was literally sick to my stomach. \n\nI asked to see the manager, and about 10 minutes of waiting told him the deplorable practices I observed, and left. I wish good old Gordon was there to throw a fit!!!\n\nStay away if you value your health!"
0,"Ok, I'm the kind of girl who grew up staying in motels, so I'm ok with your average Travelodge. This place is your BELOW average Travelodge... Reasons:\n\n1. Didn't ask if we were ok with a smoking room (yuck...hotels still allow this?)\n\n2. One bath towel, two guests... twice in the same week, with no apology\n\n3. Air conditioning sounds louder than a Harley Davidson\n\n4. Got back after a full day out (8+ hours) and the room wasn't cleaned\n\n5. Front desk didn't seem phased by this when I called to complain \n\nI will NOT be staying in a Travelodge again anytime soon. I highly recommend any other hotel than this one if you're planning on staying in Scottsdale."
0,"This place gets crazy packed and the lines are ridiculous! its out the door and when you finally get inside the door there is another line waiting! I had to wait almost 1- 1 1/2 hours just to eat here and it WAS ALL HYPE! because this is the first Golden Corral to open up down here so of course those enticing commercials we see time to time on TV makes people super excited for this one! But from my experience here this is what i have to say about this place.\n\n- Long line & ridiculous wait\n- Overhyped\n- Drinks ARE NOT included with your meal\n- Understaffed and they couldn't handle all the customers pouring in\n- Area was not clean & dirty tables were left around\n- Waited 30 minutes one time to just get to the grilled steaks\n- People would be eating in the lines BARBARICALLY or kids will be running around with food in their hands\n- People are RUDE, but hey when you're hungry you tend to get grumpy\n- Food is WAYYYYY too salty!!!\n- Desserts were tasteless and stale \n\nThe only good thing was their steaks, the chef cooked it to a perfect medium rare, but  after everything i had to go through to get the steaks. NO THANKS!"
3,"Free Wi-Fi, Unlimited Coffee Refills of surprisingly decent quality, a handful of individually bagged hot teas, and now with 3-4 varieties of iced tea plus iced coffee - sure I'm not going to pay what they charge for a sandwich I could make for 1/3 the price using better ingredients at home, but for beverages and simply killing time or getting some work done there aren't too many places I prefer."
4,"I went to Toyama with a few friends on Saturday night and had a great experience. The owner and his wife were very nice and she greeted us when we arrived at Toyama. \n\nThe sushi was great, very fresh and plenty of different choices to choose from. We were all very happy with our food and service. \n\nThey also had Toro available ... which has been hard to find.  My fiance is always asking for it when we go to sushi places and it's been rare that anyone has had it. \n\nToyama is great  for a smaller place to have dinner with friends."
0,Traveling from San Francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8am\nWe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone \nVery disappointing
0,"Verizon stores and their system of herding their customers must have been designed by some Machiavellian-type person who watches from afar, with hidden cameras placed in all locations, and watches what transpires inside the stores like some sort of \""Big Brother\"" experiment in human behavior.\n\nWhen I walk into a Verizon Wireless store because my unfortunately-named Verizon Glyde (all I can think of is a personal lubricant, how about you? maybe I have a dirty mind...) with a touch screen no longer wants to be touched... the \""greeter\"" scowls at me, tells me it's gonna be at least an hour and a half, and then adds my name to the bottom of the queue.  \n\nI instantly notice that it smells of excrement... and that, quite literally, the store is crawling with humans.  It's like a bus station.  There are sad-looking people on benches, huddled together for moral support, crying in the corner, and laying in a puddle on the floor.  I relegated myself to sit by a wobbly-looking display with outdated products, hoping I'd be left alone to wait out my sentence.\n\nI have rarely seen the likes of the despair that I saw in my two hours of waiting in the Verizon store.  I bore witness to two different women using Verizon phones, calling customer service in tears, bawling about how the reps at the store refused to help them. I should have taken this as a sign. I watched a person pick off a really large scab. I saw a really together-looking dude get to the point of a breakdown when a rep jumped another customer in front of him in the queue. I mean, there was almost a brawl. I saw three crickets, a spider and a roach... and this was all before my name was called.\n\nThe service rep could not, no, WOULD not, fix my phone.  He took one look at the Glyde and started to laugh. \""THIS is the worst phone Verizon ever produced.  I can't fix this thing.  I won't even be trying.  Sorry, girl.  You need to get yourself another phone.\""  Rep then proceeded to detail my options. A. Buy brand-new expensive phone. B. Buy pre-owned expensive phone. C. Be phoneless.  \""Surely you must have a clunky Zack Morris-style phone to donate to a damsel in distress!\"" I protested.  No dice.  \""Not even a loaner until my next paycheck?\"" Not a snowball's chance in hell.  \n\nIt's ever so obvious that I was never going to get my phone fixed, and no matter what was wrong with it, I was going to be told that I had no choice but to purchase an entire new phone.  I think it's more than a little messed-up to not offer your customers solutions and options instead of backing them into corners. I'm between paychecks, and couldn't justify paying the evil overlords of Verizon hundreds of dollars for another POS, so I am now incommunicado, and am totally bummed."
1,"I had the pork sliders.\nBased on that i cant recommend the place.\nIf you're staying at the Cosmopolitan, try one of the other restaurants.\nThe service was good however."
4,"Dr. Harter is an absolutely amazing and caring doctor.  He has been my OB since my daughter was born in 2009. I had an emergency c-section due to severe preeclampsia, after planning a VBAC. I was devastated by the turn of events, but Dr. Harter held my hand and told me he was very sorry but I was too sick to wait any longer, but I could definitely have a VBAC someday. Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014. I could not have asked for a better or more supportive OB. *Note*Due to his popularity, it can be hard to get in to see him, and wait times can be long because he's delivering babies...a lot! Those are small inconveniences to me, to get a good doctor!  :)"
4,"Had a great dinner at Elephant Bar last night! \n\nGot a coupon in the mail for 2 meals and an appetizer for $20! While they did limit the  selections you could get with the coupon, we were happy with the choices so it worked out fine.\n\nFood was delicious and the service was fantastic! Waitress was very attentive and polite.\n\nLocation was a plus too! Had a lovely walk around The District shops afterward. \n\nAll and all, a hands down 5 stars!"
0,If you are sent here due to a work related injury do more research. While the staff may seem friendly and helpful. Once 5 pm hits its time to go. Sorry if the work is incomplete we can start again tomorrow. I did not see the regular dentist so I can not speak about him. But in any event it us probably best to steer another direction
0,Horrible.  Went in looking for a gift salesgirl said buy anything pink and you get free socks.   Picked out a gift waited in a line that there was no organization to with people cutting in.  Got to the counter and the girl rings me up and I ask where are my socks and she shrugs and says oh we ran out awhile ago.  Got to love the communication or lack there of with this organization.  I won't be back.  Hello Lucy and Athleta can't wait to become a regular with you guys!!
1,"Food was average, waitress was the worst.\n\nWe had 4 people in our party. 3 of us had failrly good meals my son however ordered the Philly ckeese steak which was a soggy mess. We thought about sending it back but the waitress never came back to ask how everthing came out. When the waitress did come back she just went through the motions of being a server she truly didnt care and should find a new line of work. My son ordered water, she forgot.. \n\nI will not be back on our next visit to Vegas..."
1,"I dunno, I was drunk when I got there.  It's amateur night there every night! They have a mechanical bull.  You might find yourself looking up at the sky wondering if it was 8 seconds.  Trust me it wasnt."
0,"Used to love this place.  The summer drink menu is disappointing and the service last time was lacking.  We went there for happy hour, and found out that we could only use our chip (Buy 1, Get 1 tap beers/wine) before 6 p.m.   It would have been nice if someone would have told us that, esp. since we went there only for happy hour.  This used to be the place to go for us (as a young mod place) with drinks that were $8-12 and well worth it.  After our last trip there, I am not sure we will be back.  Two drinks and an appetizer and our bill was nearly $40.  We are happy to pay that if the service is good and the menu has good selections.  This place is going to go under if they don't fix something."
4,"Delhi Palace has won my heart for Indian food.  There is a great lunch buffet that is well worth a drop in from time to time.  I'm not sure if this location is associated with the Delhi Palace on University, but I have been to both and liked both.  Sometimes Indian food buffets can feel not so fresh, but both of these restaurants keep things fresh and heated.  \n\nThis restaurant has my stamp of approval as my favorite Indian food in the Phoenix area."
2,"The feeling of being inside a gigantic chandelier was truly a novel experience, however it wasn't worth the pretentiously pricey drinks. Weak drinks, average service. Boring"
2,"I'm mixed on this one.  We had a disaster for Brunch so we wanted to make up for it for dinner.  I was totally craving sushi and I did indeed get great sushi here.  It was enough to make this sushi snob want to come back for more...as take-out.\n\nThe ambiance leaves much to be desired for such a high priced place.  If I am paying $14 for a sushi roll and $25 for  a dinner plate I want date night worthy.  What I got was Denny's worthy.  It's cheap, it's boring, and there were kids crying at the table next to us the entire time.  I asked about switching up a roll and was told changing spicy salmon into spicy crab in a sushi roll would incur a $2 charge.  I said nevermind and went with the roll as is.  The waiter was attentive and just the right amount of presence, always a plus, and other than the decor and the weird upcharge I LOVED my food.  Edamame was perfectly steamed, the sushi was ohsogood.  My husband ordered the hibachi which was sooooo bland.  I don't think they used any salt or pepper in the cooking process.  There were three small pieces of shrimp, a tiny handful of veggies, loads of noodles and rice, and a good portion of steak(which was very tender, but unflavored) and chicken which was overcooked.\n\nAll in all the sushi is worth going back for, but I won't be trying their Hibachi nor will I be staying around.  Take-out is where it's at."
1,"I expected to love this place. We loved  Burger across the street and Steak at Paris, Very disappointing had lunch with my husband at the bar. New waiter on his first day probably would have been better on his own. The guy training him was offensive.  When I said I did not like their take on the corned beef sandwich in a bowl he said I shouldn't worry about looking pretty while I eat it just dig in there.  high priced as it is and after presenting our Harrahs card still did not get the $4 off a $20 so called corned beef sandwich. Why bother putting the two prices on the menu if they don't understand what it means.  Will not be going back."
1,"I tried this place because of the high reviews. It's a shame when you go somewhere with high expectations and you're let down. \n\nWe tried their one item carryout pizza special for $5.45, let me tell you, you get what you pay for. The pepperoni and cheese were so skimpy and non-existant. I ended up scraping the toppings onto TWO slices, the rest of the pizza/ scraped off dough were thrown out.\n\nFortunately, or so I thought I still had a BLT, the bacon consisted of little bits here and there. What happened to the fresh bacon? The long slices of bacon? Or plenty of bacon? They weren't in my sandwich, that's for sure.\n\nChecho fries, yeah we got an order. $2.99 for a little to go box doesn't seem worth it. When I was there I saw a basket being delivered to the table next to me, I thought that was more like it, so unless you're eating at the restaurant pass on the Checho fries.\n\nI probably won't go back."
4,It is our last day in Montreal and we were looking for one last lunch to close out our wonderful trip. We stumbled to Cafe Cherrier and were happy as soon as we stepped in. It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful.
0,"Never rent from this Avis. The Operations Manager is a sloppy blonde, with a really bad attitude. Absolutely appalling customer service. I'm not sure who decided she was a good fit for being in charge, but they should strongly consider a more personable candidate for this position. She obviously didn't want to be there, and had no interest in servicing customers. Go down the way to Enterprise. Don't waste your money at this Avis. If you must rent with Avis, cab to the one on Las Vegas Blvd, cause the lady who runs this one is seriously past her expiration date..."
4,My hubby n I dined in tonight. Got a pizza. It was delicious! The prices are good & the staff is friendly. Extra points for this location being so convenient to where live!
0,"I shop 100% organic for myself and about 70% for my household. Coming to this store was a MAJOR disappointment. I feel like the people who work/shop here are generally uneducated about clean eating. The one thing I found that I needed was a small bag of organic grapes to appease my 5 year old sister. When I went to check out (that was my only item) and they said $10 my jaw dropped. Then the cashier exclaimed, \""Well their organic what do you expect!\"" You mean to tell me that if I want fruits free of GMOs and chemicals, I should pay 4 times the general asking price? Mid summer? No thanks. Right before that, the (maybe 20 year old) uneducated butcher told me that their free range meat, the one option they had, was \""basically organic\"" because the cow are grass and grass \""probably\"" doesn't have any chemicals. Are you kidding me!? I wouldn't go here if I were a millionaire! Terrible service! Terrible selection. The 2 most important things to my family and I!"
3,"The bruschetta is tasty and a great starter.\n\nThe Oregano's Salad (hold the olives) is just bomb. Order the small and it's enough for 3 adults.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ chicken pizza (added pineapple) and it was tasty. The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh, and it's not greasy.\n\nThe servers are upbeat, fast, and knowledgeable.\n\nThe menu is kind of huge and you can skip over things easily, but do NOT miss the warm cookie pie for dessert.\n\nPS - if you are cold and sitting outside, ask for a blanket...they've got them!"
2,Typically buffet. Dried out food and over priced. Don't go without a discount of some kind. Go the Denny's for breakfast instead.
0,"The vibe of this place seems very sketchy, and the fact at all of the work on the walls has prices seems a bit off. The staff are unfriendly and rude and do not greet you after you walk in for a good ten minutes or so. That being said, I do not know about tattoo work here. Piercings, however, are a different story.\nDon't do it.\nThe woman who did them did not seem to know what she was doing, and did not even clamp the area before piercing, causing bleeding. And then she went on to make fun of my friend for this, for a good long time. Talk about unprofessional! She also refused to put in the type of jewelry requested, and only put in the type she first grabbed, even with an explanation about why this type of jewelry would be the worst for the piercing. \nI had heard good things about this place, but I see know that everyone was very mistaken. In the future, if I ever need another piercing or tattoo, be assured that I will not be going here. Or trusting the judgement of said friends."
4,"Hey, this place is really good. And they have sweet music. And it's cheap. And there might be some alcohol there. Go."
4,"Got a week?  That's about how long it would take to visit all the stores in this Mall.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed with happy shoppers.  They have every store that you could ever dream of, plus some that you never thought of.  I was weighted down with packages in no time and my feet were so tired by the time made it from Nordstroms to Dillards, I gave up and went back to my hotel!"
4,I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!
2,With such great reviews I have been trying! I have been there tree times now and I am not surprised! The prices are reasonable and you get decent food. But thats not what I expected. The chocolate and caramel trotewas bad! The cupcakes were ok but for 1usd you can't expect much. The buttercream wasnt impressive... But the filled croissants with blueberry or the one with cheese were not bad at all. It was not a real croissant but satisfying. Since it is in a really convenient location I will probably go back but without the expectations that I had before.
0,Went with a family group of 12 and no one had anything good to say about their meal.
0,"Very poor service.  I ordered several books online and requested all new.  They shipped me two of them used.  When I contacted them, they said they do that if no new ones are available - without even confirming with the customer.  When I said that I wanted new, as I requested, they said I would have to bring the book in and order it again.  I reminded them that I paid for shipping so I wouldn't have to go down to pick them up.  They did not care.  They pretty much said that I would have to do the leg work to correct THEIR mistake.  No concept at all of what good customer service is."
0,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! If I could give zero stars, I would. The people (who I won't even refer to as nail technicians), were performing a pedicure on my feet when they CUT the bottom of my foot and then called me a LIAR and yelled at me and told me that the cut had already been there, which it obviously hadn't (the cut which they did was bleeding and had erythema around the edges because it had just happened). If the cut would have already been present, I wouldn't have gone in for a pedicure in the first place and they would have noticed a cut during the first five minutes before they cut me. While the cut upset me, the accusatory demeanor of the staff was rude and totally uncalled for. I got up and left after being treated so horribly. With all of the nail salons in the Valley, go somewhere else. Such a horrible \""nail spa\"" with rude, condescending, accusatory staff."
1,"I've had it with this place. I've never used the car wash, I don't buy the overpriced junk food and useless trinkets they sell there, I only go there for gas....and only because it's located on the way home from work. \n\nOkay, the last three times I've been there, the pumps failed to give out a receipt. It may seem trivial to you....but it really bothers me when the machine specifically asks if you want a receipt, then fails to deliver one.\n\nBefore you can even get gas here, the pump makes you complete a questionnaire. Question 1: Are you a Vons something something member? No! Question 2: Would you like a car wash? No! Question 3: Would you like a receipt? Yes!!!!! Then after all that, you can finally pump your gas.\n\nI'm really tired of paying for gas outside, pumping gas outside, then going inside to wait in line behind a group of confused stoners counting out pennies and nickels to pay for their crumpled bags of Funyuns and 94oz Mountain Dews.\n\nI'm going someplace else from now on."
3,This place is absolutely a treat.... Great dessert section portions are perfect bite. I had wine paring with mine
0,"Back to poor service.  The food was ok, not worse than before but the experience was dreadful. A coupe seated after us got their good, bill, paid, and left before we were midway through our meal. Waiter was barely around.  Yes they have large groups but all that says to me is that the management is poor and they do not know how to schedule staff.\n\nService was so bad the waiter got $0 tip.  We will not be going back here for quite some time, once again.  Shame too because they are the only place I know of that has banoffie pie."
2,"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place back when it was Dodge Theater but I don't see it here so oh well. My husband and I went to see a Christmas concert here of The Piano Guys recently and that was the first time I've been here in a couple years. First off, I was shocked to see a line of people that extended down a full city block and then wrapped around and doubled back almost the whole way down the street. There were no dividers or ropes or any staff providing direction so everyone was confused as to where the line started and ended and I saw a ton of people \""taking cuts\"". It seems like they could come up with a better system for getting people in the door. Fortunately it moved pretty quickly so we still made it to our seats before the show started.\n\nMy biggest complaints about this place are that there are not enough restroom facilities and also that the drink prices are outrageous. I know, I know, you could say the same about almost any other concert venue in the valley but that is no excuse. As others have mentioned the seats are a little on the small side but not too uncomfortable. I do wish there was more leg room, mainly because once people are seated there is absolutely no room left for walking if you have a seat near the middle of a row. I will say that the acoustics are great and the lighting and effects at the shows I have seen were wonderful. I also like that it is small enough that even the seats in the back can still see but I do wish that they had not put seats on the bottom sides where the edges of the stage block your view. They do warn you when you buy the tickets that it is an obstructed view but really you can not see hardly anything. They should have just used that space for more bathrooms instead of seats that are basically worthless."
0,"I will always give any Albertson's one or two stars simply due to the fact that they refuse to put in self check-out lanes. One time the manager told me that his customers requested they get removed...really? The three's a crowd rule is dumb especially when you only have one lane open or maybe two and even then one of the lanes is 15 items or less. This is a backwoods store who is not willing to advance to the future and give customers a guaranteed fast way to buy their groceries. Nothing else here really stands out and they don't really make their own bakery items. The best thing I have found is the Instant Rice, for some reason this rice kicks butt over the big names of rice. I also get annoyed when the checkers leave their area and come outside the checker zone (standing in front of lane) while I'm pulling in with my cart. This just wastes time overall, it is like a toll collector leaving the booth when I want to pay my toll.\nAlso, I don't like Halloween stuff appearing in August."
3,"I gave them 4 stars only because they are so new. Probably would be 3 stars but the staff was trying very hard. I think they should STOP, review talk about the pros and cons and have a good training day. Staff were confused on where food went and what table numbers were. You can't have staff walking around looking for who ordered what.\nPOS the staff was using was phone size and they seemed to struggle with inputting the orders.\nNow the food, we had a table of 4 and all had something different. Cod bites were good, as were the chicken skewers. I had the Meatloaf which I would give an A, very tasty and the mashed potatoes were perfectly seasoned for my taste.\nAnother dish was the Chicken Noodles, not-so-good, had a very odd taste spices didn't seem to work.\n3rd dish was the Salmon surf. Pretty hard to screw up Salmon but it was over salted, sorry.\nLast dish was Fish Tacos. She had Cod tacos instead of Salmon and said she enjoyed it. She wished they offered Black beans with the tacos to make it more authentic, but enjoyed it.\nDesert we had the Bread pudding. It was very good, not the best in town, but very good.\n\nLocation, Location, Location is one of the best in the Valley. I'm not sure why other restaurants have not made it there as it's a wonderful, beautiful location on the Lake in \""The Lakes\"" community. Tons of space inside and on the outside patio, there's even a boat dock for the locals.\nEntertainment.\nThey had Live music on the Friday night we were there and they were good. They also have separate areas where you and your friends can play pool, throw darts, or play a little corn hole. Huge bar fully loaded makes it a place you could spend the evening.\nWho was there?\nSeemed like a nice mix of people young and old. Decor was very open, maybe even too much but I still liked it. View was amazing.\n\nI hope they take the suggestions of their critics good and bad as we'd really love to see this place succeed. With a little tweaking, this could be a place I visit often. We wish them the best of luck, we'll try again in a couple months to see how things progress."
2,"I always come here during lunch because they have good specials on the tofu soup! It's cheap, delicious & comes with a lot of food! And usually the service is quick- not too long of a wait.\n\nHowever, I ate here for dinner the other night and the wait was ridiculously long! It was just a party of 2 but we waited over an hour. What made me angry was the fact that there were seats open!! There were at least 4 tables open but they didn't fill those up. They made us wait an hour and they finally sat us- at the table that was open this entire time!!! \nWe did the all you can eat and it was only $16.99. Lots of food & it was good~ love their short ribs!!\nIt's good, cheap food but you just have to wait a looooong time!"
2,"For french food, it was a regular food.. not bad and nothing out of the ordinary."
2,"Always wanted to stay at the Palms and finally did for New Years. Was intrigued by the clubs and restaurants inside and figured, even though it was off the strip, it wouldn't be too hard to get around with cabs. \n\nHotel itself was fine. Room was nice. But I wasn't impressed with the clubs, and it wasn't worth staying there just for them. My group ended up going out to the Cosmopolitan, Planet Hollywood, The Venetian and Aria for our nights out anyway. \n\nWouldn't stay here again. On strip is much better if you're planning to bounce around various nightlife spots."
0,"The food here was TERRIBLE. Really, Really bad. We had ceviche. It tasted like ketchup with chunks. I had shrimp, which was very over cooked. My husband had a hamburger which he ordered medium, but was very well done. My friend had chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken was dry and over cooked. The place was empty. I can see how the patio would be nice on a pretty night, but it was too hot to sit outside so we were stuck inside, which is like any other chain restaurant in America. The beer was fine. The service was good. Would NEVER GO BACK."
3,"I really enjoy the decor and atmosphere here. Comfy couches, great coffee, lots of outlets for us computer-dwellers. I had the tomato basil quiche...it was good, but it was around 2 pm so it probably would have been really good this morning. \nI have never been here in the morning hours, so I don't know how hectic it gets or what the service is like when it's busy, but it's great for a midafternoon study spot."
4,I can't wait to get back to the Wynn.  The Wynn is truly one of the top hotels on the strip.  They employees do the little extra things that make you feel like you are the most important guest in the building.  Check-in was fast and easy.\n\nThe room was the best that I have had in Vegas!!  The decor was modern and the room was very clean.\n\nWe ate at the buffet for dinner and the food was the best we had on the trip - recommend that you eat there at least once on your stay.\n\nThe casino has something for everyone.  The minimum bets on the tables are reasonable to extravagant depending on your style of play.  The dealers make you feel comfortable regardless of your expertise.\n\nRelax and have fun at the Wynn!!
3,"I signed up on Yelp just to post about Lunchbreak. Even though their coffee and breakfast burrito are my favorite, I have never had an un-tasty meal from these guys. Definitely can't go wrong with the buffalo chicken wrap, italian meatball sub or chef salad. Very prompt deliveries!"
0,"Working at a fast food place is not a dream job, but it's not that complicated either. You are there to do your job correctly and get paid, the end. This is something that the employees there need to take note of. My boyfriend and I were super hungry our way home from the Fashion Show and Chinatown. Alas, there's a KFC! We ordered, got our food and left, only to find that his meal's side dishes were missing back at home. He was really ticked since the side dishes were what he was most looking forward to, and the KFC was really far and out of the way to have to drive back to get the order corrected.\n\nMy meal was fine, but I wouldn't risk going back there. The employee handling our food was too busy talking to an off duty employee to make sure she had everything right. It was a very typical food order for them and they managed to mess that up? Not coming back to this location."
1,"Was craving a frozen hot chocolate all week long prior to going to Vegas, so I walked down here after doing a bit of shopping at the Forum shops. Seeing as how I was ONLY gonna get a frozen hot chocolate, I went to the line outside and thought, oh, this is going to move fast cuz there's only 4 people in front of me. \n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\nWaiting\n\n20 min later, I finally get to the front of the line. SLOWEST MOVING LINE EVER! Why do they not have more people working here when the line moves at the speed of molasses. My grandma can do cartwheels faster. \n\nAnywhoo, after paying a ridiculous $10 and waiting over 20 min, i finally had my meh frozen hot chocolate. Wasn't as good as the first time I had it. I feel sorry for the people who were waiting behind me in the growing line."
0,It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.
1,"We just moved to MTL and he had never had a smoked meat! We were a bit lost and hungry and stumbled upon this Dunns location. The roomies had just has a great Dunns experience back home. So I decided this would be a great place to intro TJ to the smoked meat sandwich. I was wrong. We split the traditional medium smoked meat platter (sandwich, fries, coleslaw, and a pickle). Positives - enough food for two, the fries were good and plentiful, pickle was tasty. Negatives - a bit on the pricey side (~$15 for what is supposed to feed one person),  smoked meat was meh (dry, salty, overly processed). Overall it was ok but I'll have a hard time convince him to try smoked meat again."
0,"I have to agree with all the other bad reviews. \n\n1.)Rooms are super old, but maybe you need to request certain towers. Did check for bed bugs because me and my daughter were itchy. But didn't see any.\n2.)They double charged and now is taking me 3 calls to get refund so I think I'll have to dispute with my bank.\n3.)Check in needs serious help in what's called customer service :/ they told me to come back to check in when as soon as I left they were checking in other guest. So I stood and watched for 10min and every single person was being checked in so I sent my husband and bingo we were in. \n4.) Empty pool was a bit weird to me.\nRegardless of it being winter you do have resort fees!\n5.)all I can say is you get what you pay for.\nIn my case I'm paying double so I end up paying what would of been a decent place."
0,"Terrible customer service. I called Walgreen's customer service 4 times, and never received a call from management as promised. Here is the email I sent them, which I have not received a reply to either!\n\nThis is the Walgreen's located at 2000 S Mill Ave  Tempe, AZ\n\n\""I have called, and spoke with your customer service several times, but have never received a call back as I was promised. The phone number associated with these calls is 480.967.XXXX. The exact date and time should be in the notes from those calls. I am xxxx xxxx, a 59 year old Walgreen's customer of 30 years. I ride a small two wheel electric scooter. It is smaller than a shopping cart. It is not practical to lock this scooter, and the expensive batteries cannot be secured. This scooter is like a two wheeled skateboard with handle bars. I have ridden it to Walgreen's, and brought it in the store with me to pick up prescriptions on many occasions. The last time I picked up a prescription I was told by a man, I assume is a manager, that I can't bring my scooter in the store anymore. This is ridiculous as it is small, makes no noise, makes no mess, takes up very little room, and is my only means of transportation right now. No one has ever complained about it, and when I mentioned not being allowed to bring it in to the pharmacist, he could not understand why, and commented that people bring bikes in the store. I bring this scooter into the grocery, hardware store, fast food stores, and everywhere I go with no problems. I explained this on the phone to your representative, and was told I would be contacted. I was never contacted even after calling back several times, and was told the complaint was being escalated. . This is terrible customer service! I regret that I am contacting my Dr., and having my prescriptions transferred to CVS. CVS has no problem with me bringing my scooter in the store, and  also allow my dog in the store, if I walk there with my dog. I am very disappointed with Walgreen's apparent lack of concern. I will also leave reviews on line wherever possible to let other people know of this incident. \"""
4,"I don't really do the lounge scene back home due to one really bad experience a few years ago at Enclave. I wouldn't go as far as to call Enclave much of a lounge, but they all kind of seem the same to me. Until I met Bond. It was a \""one-thing-led to-another\"" relationship with Bond. *Blush!*\n\nI visited Bond about 3 times over the course of one week and even decided to stay at his place on my last night! Well, by his place, I really mean the Cosmopolitan. And it was with my husband for our final night in Vegas, so I guess it was kind of a threesome. Yeeah... about Bond.\n\nThe music is pumping, but not obnoxious. The DJ was great. The decor is excellent. The seats are comfy. The scene is full of variety, but not like a douche circus. I drinks? Don Johnson joined me a few times. The staff? Friendly and fabulous. I donned my glitzy best and can't wait to visit again on my next trip through town."
3,"I love H&M, they are affordable and have some unique styles. I am the type that loves embellishments; give me zippers, buttons, clasps, pins, and patches on my clothes. The fact that they are using organic cotton and recycled fibers intrigue me. Their dress clothes are stiff and abrasive against the skin, at first, but after a few washes they won't irritate. They are good for work. Especially if you are looking for cheap, stylish, and you won't be heartbroken if they get messed up. \n\nH&M's casual wear is more my style. Their t-shirts and jackets appeal to my excessive need for bedazzlement.\n\nTry everything on, because they don't seem to have any standard size. I was swimming in a medium button up, but tried another style only to have it fit perfectly. This happened with jackets, under shirts, and pants. It cannot be a fluke."
3,Prior to NYC having any Whole Foods location I was OBSESSED with any location I happened upon. We have had WF for over a decade now in NYC but I still visit other locations with interest. This is one of the nicest I have been to probably in part because it is quite new. (having opened last September one of the employees told me) The outdoor seating area on the 2nd floor is nice. \n\nClearly we are not in NYC as one of the deals in the prepared foods area was 4 for $4 where you could get 4 of the salads (healthy selections designations) for $4. The soup selection was pretty good the only thing I would say is the hot/cold prepared foods on the buffet were kind of so so.\n\nLots of available parking downstairs.
1,"I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches). We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries. Food arrived and mine tasted fine. My boyfriend said his philly was very dry and the bread was clearly burnt. He couldn't wait to leave. I can't say my burger was bad because it wasn't. I liked the egg bun too. Fries were not warm though and that was a bummer.\n\nWe didn't get dessert, just the check. We left for about $30. Sorry TapHouse but we won't be back. Nothing special here"
3,"fun little course. great practice spot. cheap too. if you dont mind the noise from the planes, you will enjoy it here"
0,"Oh Avoid this place @ ALL Costs. They will double bill your insurance, run tests that they do not bother to #1 inform you they're running & #2 you cannot get test results even on tests they run. They are very unprofessional & treat you as if you are a hassle to them. You will get billed for $53.00 for going in on Sunday which they consider to be a weekend visit. My son wound up going to Southern Hills Hospital & what a blessing it was to meet Dr. Sondrup & his staff. Dr. Hayes & Dr. Daulat have no business in the medical field. They spent all of 7 minutes with my son on 4 different visits {not the 5 they are billing for}. Honestly, they should be ashamed of themselves & may God have mercy on their souls."
3,Very good meal -- a la carte dinner. And service above and beyond. Must go back for the buffet.
4,"I love this place. When my family first moved to Arizona, my sister and I went here all the time to get shaved ice. They have a huge variety of flavors and they always make it right.\nWater and Ice is owned by lovely people who are always kind and helpful, and great to talk to. Their store has a huge selection of candy, snacks, drinks, frozen treats, etc. Everything is always fresh. Their prices are fair and it always feels good to help out a family rather than go shopping next door at albertson's.\nWater and Ice is a great place to go for a sundae or shaved ice on those hot, Arizona days!"
0,"A 1 1/2 Stars from me! Dreadful! I spent the longest year of my life the fifteen minutes I spent looking for help in there! I wanted to know where the TV department was so I could look for HDTV's. No one knew where the TV department was! Finally, by use of my OWN EARS AND EYES I found it, saw high prices and left, thank God! Good service is \""How may I help you?\"" heard from many salespeople. I heard none at all, had the feeling it was because I was a white man in a store with Latino and Black salespeople. Unacceptable! Dreadful store!"
2,"I woke up early one morning and stumbled into this cupcake place...opting to skip eating breakfast at McDonalds' inside the food court, I somehow stumbled into this small place located next to the Monte Carlo Pub.  I decided to try something different for breakfast, and give their cupcake a try.   I ordered the \""Oh, My Gosh\"" cupcake, which the girl suggested as one of their most popular cupcakes.  After grabbing a cup of coffee at Starbucks, I sat down and began to dissect my cupcake.   The vanilla cupcake was filled with a chocolate ganache, topped with chocolate and vanilla buttercream.   The cupcake was moist, but the cream was a tad bit dense and way too sweet.  I would have enjoyed it more with a beer, but the sweet cupcake didn't go so well with my caramel macchiato; way too much sugar to start the day!  The cream frosting was just too thick and heavy for my liking, and too sweet.  The cupcake was $3.75 plus tax, which came out to be $4.08...honestly since when do they start charging tax on cupcakes!?  \n\n For the price of the cupcake, I did not think it was worth $4.  I would have been better off going to Jean Phillipe or Payard and getting a sweet dessert or a pastry.   Other cupcake places like Sprinkles make better cupcakes than here, but so far I have not found too many cupcake shops on the strip in Vegas.   I guess if you have a cupcake craving these cupcakes might satisfy your appetite, but don't expect these cupcakes to be breathtaking delicious.  The cupcakes seem to be okay, they definitely have room for improvement, such as making the cupcake a tad less sweet.  I will probably go back to try a different cupcake, hopefully the next cupcake will turn out better!"
1,"I ordered a refill using their automated phone in option. The pharmacy at this location is severely lacking. I went in on Wednesday to pick up an Rx, they said they were having issues billing my secondary insurance, so after about 20 minutes I told them I would call my insurance and come back the next day. I called my insurance the next morning and was told there was nothing wrong on either of their ends- all authorizations had cleared on the expensive medication. Thursday, I went in to pick up the medicine, and they still had issues billing my insurance. 20 minutes later, they find out that they weren't able to bill my insurance correctly because they were trying to bill them for an incomplete prescription (they only had 7 pills rather than the 30 to fill the script). I was never told they didn't have enough medication to fill the script. \n\nThey gave me the 7 pills they had previously filled for me along with an IOU for the rest of the medication and I paid my copay.. I can't imagine that it's company policy to handwrite an IOU on a receipt for $500 worth on medication.\n\nOn a brighter note the staff was polite, although one of them seemed really annoyed at my persistence but I suppose I'd get a little frustrated too."
3,"This is a new fav happy hour place for us, we've already been here twice this week. It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool. Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive. \n\nCan't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain. I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar. My fiance loved his burrito.\n\nThere is also a nice little patio."
1,When you first walk in it looks like you're about to have a great experience. However I was highly disappointed. First of all they UNSANITIZED tools on me. I was charged for a glitter that I didn't even want AND my gel nail polish chipped the next morning!!! I was not happy to pay $60 for a gel mani and a regular pedicure that didn't even last 24 hours. The one positive thing I can say is that they were extremely friendly.
3,"I just ate the most expensive but the best burger ever in my life. $60 burger sounds crazy but it is totally worth it. You can taste each layer of ingredient of the burger. Foie gras, truffle, kobe beef are the best combination for burger. Fried zucchini and sweet potato fries are really good. My wife had Blackjack burger and it's very good.  Highly recommended."
1,"I had some pretty high expectations for this buffet and i was disappointed. For the price 30 per person on a weekday and considering this buffets' location i expect better. The food was just OK. Some of the highlights I had were the already pealed shrimp, prime rib and some of the pasta's. Some of the low lights, the Chinese food, the sushi and the desserts. Chinese food was crap, the sushi was sub par although there was a large selection. The dessert stations looked nice but the food itself wasn't good. And now for the BIGGEST low light. The crab legs. I had some high expectations for them, including love when i saw that they were already cracked open and all you needed was your fork so that you could just remove the meat and eat. The problem....they were frozen solid. I took two legs and let them rest a few mins figuring they would thaw out and be ok...they were too far gone frozen. Honestly just crappy. I was very disappointed with the whole thing especially for the place and the price."
3,It's a very difficult task to stand out along the crowded waterfront. The few times I've been have been great but not quite great enough to take time away from its neighbors.   The concept is there and I will continue to patronize it in search of a fifth star and some more fingerling potatoes.
1,"The first time I tried Pro Nails, I had a pretty good experience. \n\nWhen I returned on April 7th, the place was bustling, and there were a lot more nail technicians working at Pro Nails. \n\nThe gal that did my mani/pedi was very nice. However, the quality just wasn't there. \n\nMy fingernails are different lengths, and my pedicure was very mediocre. \n\nAll in all, this was a typical \""chop shop\"" experience. \n\nWhen will I learn?"
0,"Updated 8/3/2013.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I wrote the updated review below wherein I was contacted by the manager of Mastro's Ocean Club. He said he would either take our three entrees off our tab or send us a gift certificate (for the price of the three entrees). I asked him which would be easier for him and he said the gift certificate. I got the gift certificate last week...it was for $100...not even close to covering the cost of our entrees. My lobster, for example was $70...that would mean the other two entrees totaled would have had to have been $30 and we all know that the scallops and the bone-in ribeye would be more than $30 each.\n\nI am really upset. I wish I would have told the manager to have the price of the entrees removed from our bill even though it would have taken him longer to do it. Believe me, we won't be using the gift certificate anytime soon, as we are very disappointed in this whole matter. And if the manager is reading this and wondering why I didn't call him...it's like this. You didn't comp us for the price of our entrees like you said you would, and if you can't abide by your word, why should I bother calling? I'm sure you'll just have some flimsy excuse why you did what you did.\n\nI'm thoroughly disgusted with Mastro's Ocean Club...no longer a fan.\n\n*****\nThe other day after I posted my review on Mastro's Ocean Club, I was contacted by their parent corporation asking me to complete a survey and note my remarks. Yesterday, the manager of Ocean Club called me to discuss my remarks. He was very pleasant and we discussed at some length the issues I had described. He provided a very nice resolution to the whole ordeal which I thought was very nice. Needless to say, I'll be giving Ocean Club another chance and look forward to making the acquaintance of the manager.\n\nOne other positive note: after enjoying the Blufeld Reisling on my visit to the restaurant, I have been able to find the wine in the Valley. After a discussion with AJ's, they explained to me the differences in the Reidl stemware created for various wines and I now have four beautiful pieces of stemware to compliment my Blufeld. Next time I will remember to note the name of my waiter, so I can give him the praise he so richly deserves for recommending this wine."
2,"Got a chance to check out Texaz grill finally. Wifey has been beggin me to go here forever and I finally caved. Not sure why, I friggin love chicken fried steak. I perused the menu, but already knew I was going for the go-to dish. we also started with an order of the fried okra. Wifey got the special, which was chicken and dumplings. Little man ordered a cheeseburger. The okra was awesome! tender, perfectly seasoned and just the way fried okra should be. My chicken fried steak was HUGE, like the size of my face. Now bigger isn't always better. The steak was just okay. Somehow with all the gravy, it ws pretty bland. The steak part tasted more like liver and the breading was a bit doughy. I wasn't blown away by my meal but it doesn't matter, it was still a good experience. the service was great, prices cheap and we didn't have to drive very far. Will I go back? probably not, but definitely glad we finally checked it out."
0,"I am stuck in Las Vegas! What's up Spirit Airlines!?? \n\nNot only was my experience one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but I also will be stuck with no where to go until tomorrow morning (over 14 hours) at no fault of my own. \n\nI was scheduled on a flight from San Diego to Las Vegas today, that was delayed. (I understand that happens) but I asked the gate agent if there would be problems with my next flight. He literally told me \""no, but make sure you run\"" (meaning to my next gate) \nWell lo and behold, I arrive, and my connecting flight was gone.  \nThey offer a flight tomorrow, no hotel, no help with getting a flight sooner from another airline, nothing. \nAnd that's \""the best she can do\"" - Ms. Avalos, in Las Vegas. \n\nWhen they are the ones that put me on the flight in the first place... Knowing my connecting flight would depart before we landed. \n\nI'm in shock that you can leave someone without anything when it is your mistake. To make it worse, there is no one else for me to speak to?! Who do I contact to resolve this situation? \n\n-one seriously disappointed customer."
1,"There was a long wait. Not sure why because there was one customer being helped and about four guys sitting around.\n\nAfter waiting for about an hour, I was told I couldn't get the tattoo I wanted on my ear because they were too small. Then when I asked if that tattoo could be done on my hand, I was told my hands were too small. \n\nAll I wanted was a Hello Kitty bow, size-wise, smaller than a quarter.\n\nBut whatever. I was ready to spend some money and the artist just shrugged and said \""oh well\""."
1,"Normally I'm impressed with Apple Store customer service. This location sucks. Every interaction I have with the staff here is rude. The girl \""helping\"" me with an exchange was asking me how to do it. Good thing I was there to help. 2 stars only because they are efficient. That's all."

0,"Been here before food is ok not the best sushi rolls in town for sure . This time I sat at the bar And sushi chefs were totally out of touch and I practically had to yell at them to get my rolls, but the retarded thing is me and my friend were the only guys at the freaking bar."
3,"We went in one night for dinner.  We got the large pizza and wings special with four sodas.  The staff were kind.  In fact (I believe the owner) said, \""you know it would be cheaper for you to get a pitcher of soda versus four individuals.\""  I thought that was great they told us that.  The pizza came out with the wings I would say 15-20 minutes.  We were asked if we needed anything.  The pizza was hot and had good flavor.  The chicken wings though were AMAZING.  Some of the best we've had in a long time.  Would like to see more of a variety of specials....We've been back twice since our first visit."
3,"They're in NDG now! \nImagine the glee when we learned that TA was bringing its pies to Monkland Ave / Girouard!  Villa Maria is the closest Metro stop\n\nSo far the pies we've had (as take-out) are:\n\nSteak Bacon Cheese. Verdict = Delicious\n\nButter Chicken. Verdict = Oh, Yummy!\n\nSpinach, mushroom, tomato & ricotta. Verdict = Vegetarian pies, although tasty and possibly healthy are not the thing of which legends are made. \n\nNed Kelly. Verdict = OMG OMG OMG!\nWhile you can easily imagine the first three pies flavour profile you're going to have to try the Ned Kelly. It's a steak pie, with fried egg and cheese and BBQ sauce all in one magical eye-popping pie! Serve any of these pies (except for the vile veggie one) alongside some mushy peas, mashed potatoes and and a cold one and you're golden.\n\nThey've got big pies to take home and they have little pies that you can eat while you're taking your big pie home. They've really thought of everything."
3,"8 times out of 10, I love this place! Occasionally they'll mess up an order but are good about getting it fixed. Also the service is slow sometimes, but other than that.. everything is tasty! It's also a really cool place to sit outside & enjoy the view!"
3,"We tried to find this place last time we were in town but failed.  So glad we tried again.  Got there early, got a great seat outside.  They were awesome with our son and made sure we knew about the off menu kids items.  Our server (Haley?) was great with him as well and very attentive.  The food was solid and the beer selection as well.  We will definitely be back."
3,"Dude... Food trucks, I love them so.  I can't even express the joy at the realization that Food Truck Friday exists... So many quality \""restaurants\"" to experience in a small space... You can pick a smattering from a number of places and create your own little slice of heaven... I am still a little partial to the fish tacos from the Roaming Fork, but there's a nice rotation of vittles from many of the popular trucks in the area... They even have a couple dessert options as well, which is right up my alley... There's only a few tables with benches connected, so bringing your own chair would not be a bad idea... Make sure to get there early if it's a nice night out because parking is a bear..."
1,"The service could be better.  Much better.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked for our drink, which was at the same time we ordered our food.  The food was good.  Not excellent, but definitely good.  I don't think I would go back again just for the mere reason that there are other places to try.  I wasn't extremely impressed."
1,"Decided to take the family out to a nice brunch, so we decided to go here. We heard good reviews so we decided to give it a try. The breakdown: Lakeview was great. The service was lagging. Constantly had to remind our server to refill waters. (Even when his section was empty). Appetizers took 30min for salmon tartare and French onion soup. By the time we got our main course we were full on bread and patience. First time here = bad experience. Food overall was ok. There's no definite wow factor."
0,"I will not be using this company again.  After confirming with the person who answers the phone and schedules the appointments, Jan, that my fee would include the same services as last year's weed control, the service man, Alex, did not complete my lawn application properly.  Because I have health needs, I cannot do the follow up spray with the hose a few days after the application.  In the past, the service has always included the watering as well with no issues.  Apparently the spray wasn't completed at all.  This resulted in more weeds.  I called as soon as I noticed new weeds popping up and Jan assured me that the service man would be by that day to spray again.  I waited and did not hear anything so I called again the next day.  Jan told me there had been an emergency (bees) and he would actually be by the following day instead to spray.  At that point, I assumed it had been done.\n\nOne week later, I notice more weeds and called Jan again.  She told me that Alex had been there and sprayed and she would call him again and follow up.  She called me back shortly after to tell me that she had misinformed me-  he had come by but there were not enough weeds to spray and it was my fault that I had not sprayed the water after the initial service.  She then proceeded to attempt to sell me pest control services and charge me a re-application fee ($40) to come out and spray.  When I told her I could not do the spray myself, she was sarcastic and rude and wanted to know why.  I should not have to disclose my medical information to a pest control company.  I confirmed on the phone before I scheduled the application to avoid that conversation.  I told Jan I would not be paying and asked to speak to her manager.  She said she would have him call me back.  \n\nAn hour later, I received a call from Alex who said because of the miscommunication he would take care of coming and doing a follow-up spray at no cost.  However, he was unable to come for a few more days and the weeds wouldn't die for 7-10 days.  \n\nIt is now a week later and my yard is littered with weeds.  I have also now received a complaint from my HOA.  I will now have to hire an additional service-NOT Apco to fix what they should have addressed from the beginning."
0,"A while ago I had a bad experience w/ Pita Jungle at Arrowhead and after that experience I decided to lay off of Pita Jungle for a while until I discovered the downtown location. I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!"
2,"I've been to Aldi stores before, back when I used to live in IL, so I was familiar w/ the layout.  If you've never been, it's like a miniature Sam's Club, but with generic-brand products and no membership fees.  \n\nIf you need a cart, you may pick one up at the side of the store by depositing a quarter, which you may then retrieve by returning the cart when you're done w/ it.  There usually is just enough room for two small-sized people walking side-by-side pushing carts one-way, so just keep this in mind as you go through the store and its mazes.  Just because most, if not all of the brands here are generic, it doesn't mean that Aldi doesn't sell quality stuff!  I was pleasantly surprised to find ORGANIC turkeys sold here the day before Thanksgiving.  Too bad all of them were about 12 pounds or larger, or else we'd have bought one to try, and I'd have one more thing to review here...\n\nThe reason I wanted to post something about my Aldi visit was to say that chocolate lovers must, if you haven't already, try a few of the European chocolates sold here!  You may find them among one of the first crates to your left as you enter the store and proceed forward.  Two brands we tried were Choceur [dark choc, milk choc, and milk choc w/ almonds (those w/ a hazelnut allergy would best stay away from the almond bar-- it contains hazelnut paste)] and Moser Roth (chili dark choc).  While the Choceur milk chocolate and almond bar was delicious (not too sweet!), I did feel the room spin as soon as I had a bite (I'm able to eat toasted hazelnuts w/out problems, but hazelnut spreads and chocolate-covered hazelnuts do cause allergy symptoms).  I'm savoring a few pieces of the dark chocolate variety as I type this... Mmm, and it's so melt-in-your-mouth creamy-dreamy!  If you're a bit daring when it comes to mixing chocolate and peppers, then you may like Moser Roth's Chili bar.  I didn't find it as spicy as my baby sis did, but then again, she doesn't really like spicy dishes (she orders a \""1\"" when at a Thai restaurant that serves dishes ranging a mild 1 to an inferno 5), but the flavors harkened to the times when I tried Mexican hot cocoa and churros made w/ Ibarra chocolate....\n\nMy older sister's MIL LOVES the brownie mixes here!  I can't review it, as it contains corn products; However, the aromas that wafted throughout the house while it baked sure smelled delightful!  (The beautiful cracked surface of the brownies also teased me until I finally had to turn away before I gave in.  LOL)"
3,"Went here after a day of drinking and gambling on our last night in Vegas.  There were three of us and we each had the loco moco and the Filipino breakfast which consisted of tocino. garlic rice and three eggs.  I was full, but it tasted so good that I kept on eating.  Wished they served the oxtail soup before 11pm cause I was too drunk and full to come back later."
3,"I saw this divalicious show this weekend, I have seen drag shows before, but I knew them so the experience was different.\n\n We arrive at the theater and was surprised to see how cozy and comfortable the venue was. Once the show started, the set was incredible.\n\n\n Frank Marino's Divas Las Vegas was fantastic. I saw the likes of Tina Turner, Liza Minnelli, Brittney Spears, (who I thought for a second they were trying to pass a woman off as a man in drag, That is how amazing he was) Celine Deon, (who was also amazing) Diana Ross, Whitney Huston, Tina Turner, Cher, Lady Gaga, Dolly Parton, Madonna, and Bette Midler. Those I remember. I love, love, loved it. The dancers were awesome.\n\n Frank Marino had so many fantastic costume changes and was so very funny. He did Joan Rivers as well. All the costumes were amazing! I loved them. This is one not to be missed. I enjoyed it completely. Truly a drag show to see! The end scene with the man change was incredible. See it!!"
3,"On our recent trip to Vegas I researched different restaurants to try - turns out that Dos Caminos AND Isla have closed. We knew we'd be in the Cosmo for the Secret Pizza (that's another review) and I wanted to try China Poblano after reading the menu on the Cosmo website. What I DIDN'T do is check the Yelp! reviews, and I'm glad I didn't. What we experienced was so far different from most reviews that I've just read!\nOK look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. And the \""salt air margarita\"" (I just HAD to try one) was worth every cent!  I have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. \nThe wait staff were friendly and efficient. The manager, I\u00f1igo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo. It came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. Adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharr\u00f3n topping. I had a fish taco which was fantastic, and K'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). \nThe drinks were what really got me excited. After the \""salt air margarita\"" I had another specialty called a \""Mexican gin and tonic.\"" It's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and I don't know what else, but it worked. For dessert I had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  I wish I had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home!\nAnyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. We loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. We'll be back!"
1,"Called about a fuel leak on my cts. The service advisor didn't want to look up my information to tell me if my car had warranty coverage, and didn't want to even listen to my problem. He just kept cutting me off mid sentence saying \""get it into me\"" and gave me the impression he didn't want to be on the phone. He also told me they would not have a replacement car for me to use while they serviced my cts. After I got off the phone I opted to take the cts to Findlay Cadillac instead even though its much further from my house and I had a great experience there. See my review for them if your Caddi needs service."
1,"Ignore the glitz and glamor...this place is a waste of time.  The wait to get in is forever long.  We stood in line at 8 and didn't get to the door until 945.  Once you get in, there are 3 levels of disappointment to choose from and to get to each one, you have to walk up and down several flights of stairs.    \n\nThe bottom floor...I didn't stay on this floor long, because people were just standing around.  I didn't come to a club to stand around and people watch, so on to the next one.\n\nThe main floor was popping.  If you can't dance and want to get lucky this is the place to be.  I could barely walk to the dance floor without people brushing their sweat up against me.  When I finally got to the floor, the bouncers were telling people to move and walk the other way bc the floor was too packed.  \""That's fine,\"" I thought...\""There's always the 3rd room. \""\n\nThe top floor had chairs and tables everywhere.  The room was smaller than my hotel room.  What's the point of having an area where you can barely move and to get out, you have to walk around in a circle?! \n\nAt this point I was done with Marquee.  I just wanted to get out, but it's not going to be that easy.  I felt like I had to go through a maze of 6-7 flights of stairs, to get out of this house of horror.  For anyone that is heavily intoxicated, I will pray for you.  \n\nSo why the extra star you may ask?  Well the bathroom line was real quick and I did get in the club for free.  However, I'm sure the line was short because people would rather pee on themselves before walking out in the cold and getting lost in the maze that is Marquee. \n\nI felt like Goldilocks and the three bears.  Except that I kept on hoping for the \""just right\"" moment, but it never came and I would have rather been chased out by a bear."
3,"Always a good time, especially with a group. The staff is generally professional, although our last waitress missed my gf's request of water in addition to her drink multiple times.  The comedians can be hit or miss, but if someone out the crowd says something stupid they get ripped up which is always a plus. Not for the faint of heart squares. Loosen up man."
4,"Lux is great. Set up with all the features than many-an-establishment might use to send off a douchey hipster vibe, Lux is as inviting as any other coffee shop I've visited. The staff is always friendly, the coffee is excellent, and, as an avid people watcher, it has a great atmosphere.\n\nSeating can get restrictive but, generally, they've utilized their space well so I can't fault them for their popularity. The only knock would be that the music is sometimes turned up a bit loud -- but if that's the worst it has going for it, then I guess it truly is....\""as good as it gets [five stars]\"""
0,"This was by far the WORST strip club that I have ever been to! The place is huge to begin with so you have a tough time seeing the stage shows if you are seated in one of the tables along the back wall. It was completely packed as well. The dancers didn't have much personality and were over the top fake. \n\nFirst off, my wife and I purchased a couples package. They advertised that they catered to couples and when I called to schedule the limo, the girl on the phone suggested getting the prepaid package. We got there and were treated like scum because we prepaid. After reading some of the other reviews this now makes sense because they didn't have my credit card to charge a bunch of stuff to. We were taken to a crappy table and stuffed in where it was hard for the dancers to come over to us and tough to get out.\n\nWe were supposed to get $140 in drinks once we got there as part of the package. The waitress was horrible and came by maybe once every hour. We ended up getting 3 beers each the entire time we were there. Those were some really expensive beers I guess. \n\nThe dancers were really cold to us until my wife would go to the bathroom. Then they would come and bug me for a dance. Only one girl was nice to her the entire time we were there. That is the only good part of our entire time at this place. Otherwise, we actually had to approach several girls ourselves and ask them for dances. In my opinion this place is NOT couples friendly at all. \n\nWe got the limo to pick us up and take us there but once you get there you have to find your own way back. There are taxis out front but definitely plan on paying to get back to the strip at the end of the night. \n\nMy opinion is that if you are a 21 year old college kid and want to see some boobs and don't mind being packed into a place that resembles a rave club, this is your venue. If you have any maturity level at all and want to be treated with any decency then you might as well just go to any of the big Vegas shows. They are all topless and the alcohol is cheaper. \n\nWe tried The Palomino Club the next night and had a much better time. We were treated with respect, the venue is fully nude with alcohol, the women were more attractive and much nicer to us, we were never without a drink and they gave us a ride back to our hotel at the end of the night. Bottom line review from me: The Sapphire is a total waste of money!!!!!"
1,"I call this place Ghetto Mart. It smells like rancid grease and salmonella. But there have a been a few times (a few and only a few) where I needed laundry soap, or syrup or something. I would never buy produce here for any reason. Prices are expensive too. \n\nTempe is in desperate need of a grocery store. (Fresh and Easy, are you listening!) Ghetto Mart, I mean Rollins Market, is not the answer. You're better off making the trip a few miles south to a real grocery store."
1,"We were there this weekend for breakfast, and ended up having brunch due to the long line.  It was $24.99 for brunch.  The wait was long but the food was ok.  I like from a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6, compared to the Wynn which I give a 9.  A lot of their food lacked flavor.  The line was long and the dessert bar SUCKED!  I love dessert, and it is a 3 compared to the Wynn which i give a 10.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Taste wise, I did not care for it.  Our waitress was great, she was very busy, but she tried to keep up with our needs especially the mimosa refills, which I guess was the only good thing about the buffet because it was included and non stop refills.  I would have given this place a 3 star except for the situation that happened while we were waiting for a table.  Originally we had 4 people for the buffet, and a few of our friends joined us and it turned into 9.  Which after waiting for an hour and a half in line, we didn't want to wait for a larger table.  There was a large group in front of us maybe about 20 before we got there and they waited for a while for a table.  So we decided that we were going to split into 2 groups since we weren't going to leave the restaurant at the same time anyways.  So we told our waitress that we wanted to go from 9 people into 2 groups of 4 and 5.  Well, when we told her that she got mad, but we weren't even next in line for a table.  We were maybe about 10 people behind being next.  So we did ask if we can get seated near each other if possible but when we told her, Marta the hostess got all mad at us and started giving us dirty looks.  We were then seated and a few minutes later my friends that met us up there were seated as well, they were seated on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another table that was vacant the whole entire time they were there even before they were seated.  So Marta could have seated us together but she didn't and while we were eating the whole time she kept giving us dirty looks.  We later realized that if it was a party of 8 people or more the gratuity charge is 18%.  So we were given bad service with dirty looks because our hostess wasn't going to get the 18% gratuity charge.  I have been to Rio and the Wynn's buffet, and never at any of the other two buffets had we had bad service due to a gratuity charge.  Like I said you get what you pay for.  And another thing that I almost forgot to mention if you are looking for the omelet station, look at the dessert bar, because it's not near where the savory food is, but if you are looking for the crepe bar, it is next to where the savory food are and oh don't get banana's for your crepe, because they are brown and mushy."
2,"My mom and I were in Vegas and she was telling me all about this new show she was watching about a pawn shop. Well, look who made the #1 child spot in her book...next day I took her to the real shop!\n\nMy mom was so excited to see the store that she watches on tv. She said it looked just like the store, but none of the main people were there. They have a section for fans to buy the show merchandise. \n\nAs far as a pawn shop goes (I think this was my first ever), it was a good size (although others say small) and narrow with lots of stuff. They have a lot of cases with jewelry, random things lining the walls, and it looked like things were in pretty good condition. \n\nWe went on a Sunday when they opened so there wasn't a line to get in. However, it doesn't take too many people inside to make it feel very snug."
2,"Nice store... probably the largest Hallmark store I have ever walked into.  I'm used to the ones in the malls that are super tiny and have enough room for you to squeeze by people frantically looking for the card that \""says it all\"" for the occasion.\n\nOriginally I came here to get a box and bow for a present, but I ended up getting a gift bag instead.  The lady working gave me a ton of suggestions.  I don't know why I was dead-set on a box... I guess I need to be more creative in my gift giving practices.\n\nI couldn't really spend too much time here since I was in a rush, but I did enjoy what I saw and the selection."
1,"I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE Cafe Boa! I have been coming here for 5 years. They usually have excellent menu options, fabulous service and healthy alternatives. So I figured that it would be a great place to take my out of town friends for a nice dinner. However, my visit over the weekend was less than good. Not great, good! The server was really slow. It took at least 15 minutes to get our cocktails and it wasn't like they were super busy or anything. It was a Sunday night!  There wasn't much in the way for vegetarian options on their current menu. Most items contained beef or pork of some sort. They were out of the wedge salad. Two of us ordered the fettucini and it was WAY too oily. Neither of us wanted to finish the dish. I think a bit of a sauce would have greatly improved this dish. One of us ordered the penne, which would have been good, had it not been so incredibly spicy. Our mouths are still burning! And our other friend ordered the fried chicken. It was probably the best option any of us had ordered, although from across the table I could see that I was probably left in the fryer just a tad too long. Our appetizers were probably the best things we all ordered. Had we just left it at that, our experience may have been better. It's probably going to be a while til I return, hopefully then they will have the issues worked out."
3,"I love this store. It is so disorganized, at first glance, with everything stacked. Huge piles of... stuff! But ask the owner, he seem to know every single item in the store. And what price tag he've put on it.\n\nSaw quite some rarities, including an Atari 2600 with 7-8 games (\u00a369 incl. 2 games). Personally I fetced a couple of GameBoy original games.\n\nVinyl, dvds, video games, misc electronic equipment. It got everything - except space to actually move in the tiny store. Genuine."
0,"Spazzing bartender started a shouting match with some friends of mine. If you like the smell of sewage over cigarette smoke, then this place is for you."
2,"Service is just okay--they are rude short with you. No parking. On a brick road that will have your car shaking the whole time. You will get your car swiped if you aren't careful. The cheese blend is good. The sauce is sweet: not slightly sweet, but sweet. There is a lot of appeal to Fioris because of the sauce. I guess I prefer something savory in my sauce and find the aggravation to make it less worthwhile than Mineo's in Mt. Lebanon"
1,This place is in my neighborhood and I decided to support a local business instead of going to a chain like Little Caesar's or something. The pizza was mediocre and the price was high. Perfect. The veggies on my pizza were basically raw and the sauce did not taste good.
1,"I know everyone raves about this place and maybe it was just our server but I did not have a good experience here. We waited about 7 minutes for our server to show up. No greeting and no smile. We ordered drinks and she brought then in a couple minutes - that was fine - but my wife wasn't ready to order. \""Just give me another minute,\"" says my wife. Well the sever took about 6 minutes to get back with us. Meanwhile the server for the neighboring tables had been back and forth four times.  Anyway we ordered and it was busy so we were patient. But meanwhile while waiting for our food another couple were seated near us being served by the other waitress. They got drinks, ordered and got their food 10 minutes before we did."
4,The food was all top notch one of the best steaks I have ever had. The stories of old Vegas were great from the show girls that work there.
0,"If I could give this a zero I would. When we walked in, there was a sign for \""$10 bucket of beers\"". Then we ordered two buckets of coors light. When we got our check they were $20 each!  They screwed the people around us too. I absolutely will not be coming back here. Don't waste your money of him on these scammers."
2,"I had purchased the 20 dollars of food for 10 buck deal, they no longer honor the coupon, so need to communicate with Yelp to get a refund.,..  Good news is that yelp has already e mailed me about this, so keeping my fingers crossed that this is no hassle.  The restaurant in the o'aces bar is still open, and they still offer some of the same stuff such as the mad max burger.   I had the Kalifornication sandwich, was pretty good, but can get that anywhere.  I will just pick a place that has no secondhand smoke and loud drunks"
4,"If you find yourself in need of eyeglasses...this is the place to go.  My prescription requires a very high correction. Visited all the local vendors, Sears, Pearl Vision, Eye Glass world, Sams, Walmart. Someone mentioned Costco to me....they blew all the other vendors out of the water. They have a great selection of frames, many options are included in the price. Didn't try to up-sell to something I couldn't afford.....When you need new fames/lens this is your one stop shop"
1,"Such better options in Vegas! Let me just tell you that.  Decided to try Ago since we found a certificate on Restaurant.com right before our trip.  Very disappointed to get there and find out they won't accept them - make sure you get them off the site then.  The saving grace was we had the most FANTASTIC waiter.  He seriously gave us the best service and offered us some great deals instead.  Unfortunately the food was just meh. And the biggest disappointment? I asked for a side of Italian Sausage with my pasta and he said they don't have Italian sausage there. WHA?? What Italian restaurant doesn't have Italian sausage? Just another place in Vegas that is over priced, smaller portions that don't taste all that great. Find yourself somewhere else.  Oh and try to time it right -- we went right when Rehab was closed for the day and we found ourselves with a bunch of loud, drunk, hungry college kids. It's supposed to be a nicer restaurant and that just killed the mood."
1,"Stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night and as a top tier member, I was still given a low floor that faced that (now learned) noisy side right toward the street. I was up all night with loud noises going on at least until 2am. Very hard to sleep. Room overall was decent but the noise will keep me from coming back here in the future unfortunately."
2,"The appetizers were very good. I enjoyed the much raved about \""Griddled Corn Cakes\"" The queso was also unique and delicious.\n\nThe butter lettuce wedge salad was so delicious. They even chopped it for me to make it easier to eat.\n\nThe pork tenderloin was so tender and moist. I\""m not a huge fan of this dish in general, but they made me a fan.\n\nThey keep things interesting by having specials daily.\n\nThe servers seemed very novice. They did not remember drink orders, I found it unusual they would walk away then come right back and ask again what we said.\n\nWent on a Monday Night at 730pm. It was definitely still active at that time. I imagine weekends must be crazy.\n\nThe food and atmosphere was excellent, I was a little disappointed in the service. Otherwise would have given 4 stars."
3,"Corey is the man!!!!!!\n\nIt was first time in Snots-dale or some even call it Snobs-dale, AZ for the SF Giants spring training and my girlfriends and I really had an Amazing time at Majerle's Sports Grill.....\n\nWe walked in based on the fact that we were hungry, the music and vibe of the place was what we wanted to start the night with. I especially loved the fact that this spot had about 25 huge Samsung flat screens on every wall ( a real sports grill better have a tv on every wall)!!!!! \n\nThe food, the service, and especially the manager/DJ ( Corey) really made it that much more of a hot spot throughout the night for my gf's and I that we could NOT seem to leave. We celebrated  Stephanie G's 29th b-day like a bunch of classy GIRLS GONE WILD that night! \n\nI can't wait to visit the staff and dance the night away while watching the BEST hip hop and r&b videos on all those awesome TV's!!! \n\nUntil next year Majerle's =)"
3,"The lentil soup is the star of this restaurant.  I wish they sold it by the gallon.\n\nYou could say Fattoush is kind of a hole in the wall, which I appreciate in an ethnic restaurant.  The decor is eclectic and seems to embody the spirit of the family owners.  If you expect fancy you may be disappointed, but if you expect a delicious meal at a fair price you'll be headed back for more.\n\nTonight I had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich (seasoned and served in a pita with tomatoes, pickles, and sauce) which, served with soup or salad at $6.95, was a steal.  And the tiny cup of Turkish coffee was just right.\n\nThe service is good and definitely very friendly. \n\nFattoush fits right in on that magical stretch of 19th Ave. between Indian School and Camelback, among so many great diverse food spots."
2,"Pretty good supermarket in terms of selection. Otherwise I thought it was a bit overpriced and was disappointed in the apparent freshness and selection of the items in the bakery section. Small wine selection, but the wines in stock included a few decent picks."
0,Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed
1,"Normally, I would give this place 3 or 4 stars but there were some issues last time I was there.\n\nI was with a group watching the election results (at a British Pub, of course). Service was incredibly slow. Not the server's fault, I think he was the only one. He was nice but I never actually got to order food. The first three beers I wanted were not available. What kind of British Pub runs out of Boddington? I guess we were lucky they had Guinness.\n\nIt could be a very cool neighborhood bar, but with places like The Lost Leaf, The Roosevelt, etc., they need to step it up if they want to make it."
2,Low expectations which are usually exceeded.
4,"Looking for something fun to do with either a group of friends, date night or team building? Check this place out.\n\nI have never taken a cooking class before, so I was super pumped to try out Alyssa's Kitchen for the first time last night for Mediterranean Cuisine night.\n\nFour people to a station. Pick wisely... you have to cook with these people for the next couple hours. They give you everything you need. Ingredients, pots & pans, kitchen gadgets & tools... even an apron. The only thing you need to bring in (I mean that you can bring in): wine or beer. The classes are BYOB.\n\nChef Alyssa walks you through each dish and all the steps. They use a camera to put her on a big screen. She also walks around to answer any questions and help. I had a battle with my artichokes. Chef Alyssa came to my rescue to show me up close how to fight them... er, clean them.\n\nWe made three dishes last night: Stewed Artichokes, Stuffed Grape Leaves and Olive Oil cake. We were going to sear some fish too, but the fish and pans were not getting along. She improvised and showed us how to season them properly... then popped them in the oven.\n\nThis class is well worth the money. They range from $45-$60. You get to cook, eat the yummy food and get a little book to take home that has all the recipes in it. Check the schedule! There are all kinds of different classes available.. all levels. Some of the upcoming include a knife class and a Superbowl spread one. Hello spicy pulled chicken sliders. Yum.\n\nSuper convenient location too... right inside Atherton Market on South Blvd. I will definitely be back."
4,"Although both JPP's in Vegas are huge, Aria edges out the one at Bellagio for selection and service.  There were also at least twice the amount of employees at this location so the line moved a lot faster.  I was able to buy some truffles and other chocolate treats to bring back home!  Quick tip: be sure to refrigerate your chocolate ASAP otherwise it'll melt in the Vegas sun!  We were lucky to have an extra mini fridge in our room so it wasn't a problem but our cousins who came along were devastated when theirs melted before they had a chance to bring them back to their hotel.  I am also noticing the reviews for the food at JPP so I'll have to add that to my list of must-eats next time I'm in Vegas."
1,"I happened to be in the University area recently around lunch time, so I quickly checked my Yelp App to see what dining options were nearby.  I found this place and decided to check it out.  When I pulled up in the parking lot, I had a bit of a dilemma as there was a Middle Eastern place right next door... but I decided to check out the Caribbean Hut since I have great Middle Eastern food in my neighborhood but no Caribbean/Jamaican places.  \n\nSo, I walked in and found that this place is one of those spots where you go up and place your order at the counter.  I quickly scanned the menu board and decided to go with jerk chicken. I asked and the girl behind the counter & she said it was served with beans & rice.  Ok - sounds good so far.  I wasn't sure about portion sizes, but I decided to go with the smaller portion size.  \n\nWhen my food came out, I was disappointed to see three little tiny pieces of chicken (which were mostly bone), rice  with only a couple of sparse beans mixed into the rice, and about half the plate was made up of some sort of slaw (WTH- she didn't tell me slaw came on the plate! I hate slaw, yuck!)  It did have 2 slices of plantains, which were tasty. \n\nWhen I dug into it, things didn't really get any better.  The jerk chicken was not very delicious - I was quite disappointed in both the subdued flavor and the terrible cut of \""meat\""...it was like 3 little chicken wings that hardly had any meat whatsoever on it.  Definitely not what I was expecting. \n\n I was expecting to dig  into a plate of wonderful calypso rice with  beans & a flavorful jerk chicken with plenty of spicy flavor. But this was just sad.  Based on the other reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but the experience was so disappointing that I probably won't be back."
4,"I was introduced to Mitchell's by a friend of mine and have been a big fan ever since! \n\nThe staff is always very welcoming and everyone at the bar always look like they're having a great time.\n\nTheir garlic parmesan wings are usually a go to for myself and friends, along with a Titos vodka of course. I look forward to many more happy hours to come!"
2,"Comfortably Decent\nBy no means the greatest bar in Madison, but I'd say it's quite a bit better than the handful of other bars within 1-2 blocks of it.\nThe decor is alright, but I'm easily mesmerized by a fish tank. The outdoor patio is large, but therefore quite popular. Menu is okay, but heavy on burgers. My tilapia sandwich was quite satisfactory, though. And I'm always a sucker for waffle fries."
3,"I have been going to Altered Ego for a while now and absolutely love it! I recently moved to CA and still go visit them when I'm in town!\n\nLet me first start by saying that I did have one HORRIBLE experience here when I made an appointment for a partial highlight and cut with Kasondra on a whim. My normal gal did not have any available appointments so I decided to test Kasondra out-BAD IDEA. I came in and took the time to explain in detail the type of color and look I wanted. She was very sweet during the process, however when she was finished there was absolutely no difference at all!!! I am naturally a brunette and have always liked to have natural-looking golden blonde highlights. Kasondra gave me no blonde color and my highlights looked brassy and unnatural. On top of that I had asked for a trim of my layers and it literally looked like someone had taken a butcher knife to my hair. It was completely uneven! I went into work the next day and my boss felt so bad for me she allowed me to take 3 hours off to go get my hair fixed!\n\nEnter Tawni-the owner of the salon. I called in a panic needing to get my hair fixed as I was leaving town on vacation. The salon offered to put me with Kasondra again but, needless to say, I was not excited about that option. Tawni was AMAZING! She completely fixed Kasondra's botched job on my hair and made my highlights and color look phenomenal! Tawni was also so interactive and engaging the whole time I was in her chair. Her assistant Sonni even gave the most wonderful scalp massage! Since then I will only see Tawni and trust her with my hair! One thing I will say is since she is the owner of the salon and very busy you are often there for a long time with other stylists washing your hair and blowdrying/styling you.\n\nI gave this review 4 stars because the salon is so quaint, the staff is lovely, and Tawni is awesome! I will never go back to Kasondra again, but Tawni's service recovery turned a horrible situation into a positive one."
0,"Sadly, I will have to take this location off my option list.  I will stick with the Sahara or Fashion Show location.  So convenient to my work place but after three days in less then a week of stopping by for some treats only to be greeted with a closed venue I am going to have to give up.  I'm just not down for making another wasted trip."
1,Meh... I thought it was very ok... And the girls working there were rude and seemed very bothered by us. I wouldn't go back
0,"Possibly one of the worst sushi restaurant's I've ever been to. A small group of friends and I went in and asked to sit at the bar. Well, actually we put our names on a piece of paper. No greeting from the employees, just a silent, wait your turn kind of atmosphere. We knew we probably wouldn't sit together (the restaurant is VERY small and they only utilize half the space), but we figured maybe a spot would open up. We sat down to wait and a party of three walked in. They were seated almost immediately. We tried to ask the waiters what had happened, but they put their hands up repeatedly and continued as they were. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited our turn.\n\n20 minutes later two parties got up from their seats leaving six bar seats open in a row. We were so happy! We promptly stood up knowing that we'd be seated next. The owners then seated a party of two that had come in after us in the spots that should have gone to us. We asked to speak to the manager who explained to us that they don't seat \""large parties\"" at the bar. We reminded her that we were totally okay with being separated, but she stuck to her ridiculous rule of not seating us.\n\nSo here we are, 25 minutes later with no communication letting us know that we were waiting to sit at a table. We asked them to seat us in groups of 2 or individually and the owner continued to explain that we were not welcome at the bar due to our party's size despite that we would all be paying individually. At this point she became hateful and manipulative. She crossed our name off of the top of the hand written list and added our names underneath all of the parties that came in after us. We were so upset that we up and left. We received no customer service (or even interaction) and were treated like an annoyance. If you want to give your money to an entirely rude and spiteful establishment for the sake of a gimmick, go right ahead but I will never be returning."
0,The only star is for the one competent employee and the equipment.  Even if your bed is ready it will still take at least 30 min for anyone to clean it and even worse for the spray tan. I have emailed the company directly 3 times instead of leaving a bad review and finally heard back the last time. They gave me credit to use for upgrades but I have the highest package and could not use it towards products. Kind of pointless annoyed and about over this whole company! Don't sign up if you haven't yet! By the time you get into a bed you are just left annoyed and not relaxed at all.
2,"I came here for dinner last week and found The Spot to be an okay place. The ambiance is cozy, and the service was spectacular. The food, however, was nothing special. The Spot Burger had a lot of good stuff on it, and the burger was cooked well, but the bun seemed like a regular store bought bun and the sauce on the burger made it soggy. If the bun had instead been a nice roll, I think it would have been awesome. The prices for the food are very reasonable, but the wine and cocktails are a little pricey. I'd come back and give it another try, but I don't think I'll end up being a regular here."
4,"CLOSED!!!!\n\nIt is close to work, so I went back had a hot ham and cheese it was quite good and the service was much better.  Tried to go back again last week and it's closed.  No sign, emptied out."
3,"So after a week in Phoenix, I had cupcaked myself out (yeah , I didn't know it could happen either).  In any case, I was still craving some dessert so I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday afternoon.  There were several people camped out on the patio, using the free wi-fi.  I grabbed a small cup of chocolate and was in heaven.  It was so rich and delicious.  I didn't think the portions to price ratio was all that bad, although I can't eat much ice cream in one sitting.  If I lived in Phoenix this place would become a staple in my life."
3,"I love that you can make your own samples here. It makes the experience so much easier and makes for a quicker decision!\n\nThey also have a great assortment of flavors and toppings. You can either go healthy and fruity, or decadent!\n\nAnd really cute spoons!"
0,"I was excited to try this new place in my neighborhood, but the overall experience was really disappointing. Though the wait staff was friendly, they were definitely scattered. The whole table had ordered coffee, but we had to ask for milk and sugar. And then again we had to ask for the spoons. The food was even more of a disappointment. I had the bagel lox with eggs, which I was really excited about. The bagel itself was not toasted and was of poor quality. It wasn't even a Montreal style bagel! It tasted pasty. The cream cheese did not taste like cream cheese at all and was off putting. The salmon however was good. My friends had bacon with their meals, which I tried, and it was atrocious. It was plasticky to the point to which it was hard to eat. It didn't even taste like bacon. The hash browns tasted okay, but some of my friends potatoes were cold. One of my friends ordered banana crepes, but they forgot to include the bananas.  Also it took the wait staff at least half an hour to clear our plates off the table. The few good things about this pace were the coffee and friendly staff. All these problems may be due to the fact that this place is new, but these issues are pretty unforgivable. If they weren't ready to open, they shouldn't have opened. It also seemed as though though they deliberately skimped put on the quality and the food. This place definitely does not live up to the high standards of other breakfast places in the area such as Prohibition and Cafe Orange."
1,"This has been a great place to eat in Chandler.  Last nite for my BD I WANTED TO EAT AT Carrabbas again.  We have been away for a couple of years and recently moved back to Phoenix.  We went to the one on west mcdowell.  My husband told our server it was my birthday and asked if they had a birthday cake and she replied \""happy birthday I\"" ll see what we can do\"" and flashed her best coquettish smile.   Then came the food.....salad was skimpy and one or two bites of romaine the ret iceberg, slightly wilted and we each had two, yes two croutons,  then what used to be amazing hot bread was only slightly warm, and tasteless.  I wanted to return the salad but could never see our server.  Then my meal. Sirloin Marsala, runny sauce more browned than should be and mostly oily taste very little of wonderful Marsala.  Husbands chicken Bryan was way overlooked and dry the feta on top was the best part ...then garlic mashed...like soup!  We finally got server and asked for pasta instead of potato soup and asked for manager to talk to about rest of meal.  While waiting, her comes server and put a small card in front of me with three desserts and said which one would you like and I picked tiramisu ....here she comes eith candles lit \""happy birthday\"".  Thus was the best part of the meal, but not a tiramisu,  mostly whipped cream and lady fingers,  she brings chech and she charged us for the \""dessert with candles\"". My husband questioned her and she snidely said we don't do birthdays!,,,  so I said take this off the ticket you led us to believe this was for my birthday....and she said oh no you misunderstood so I said get me your manager and she threw down the check and walked away,  manager finally came over and we explained about the dessert and he removed it...ans said he would talk to the kitchen about the potatoes...??  Then here comes the server and she tossed our credit card on the table and stormed off.....so my tip for her was written on tip line...\""check you attitude\"" girlie!  \n\nReally sorry as I had good memories of food here....maybe the Chandler location hasn't gone down like this location but don't think i will find out...."
1,"Only in Vegas could you make reservations at a place that threatens to charge you $50 per person if you don't show up to be seated at a plastic folding table.\n\nThe service was fine. A little slow but they tend to drag their feet a bit when they're charging you a whole lot for not much substance, it's makes you feel like you're getting more out of the experience I guess.\n\nI asked the waiter if they had any vegan options and watched him struggle through the menu before saying he'd have to ask the chef, which I don't think he ever did because we never got an answer.\n\nEveryone in our party said they liked their meal but no one liked it enough to finish everything on their plate which says something.\n\nTheir prices are fairly astronomical for what you get and I believe that they try to cover up what is basic food with a fancier name. Roasted Corn Soup = one of the cartons of soup from Trader Joe's, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos = raw tuna chunks with a side of commercial grade tortilla chips, Cornmeal Crusted Chili Relleno = big jalapeno popper, Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak = Chili's summer special.\n\nI'm sure there are good aspects of this place, we just didn't see them. \n\nI guess everything in Vegas is a gamble."
2,"It was Saturday and the girls had gone out to day drink. They met a host that said he could get us all in for free to 1OAK (5 guys/5 girls). So that is where we went.\n\nWe got there around 10:30 just as we were asked to. The line? to get into the club looked absolutely ridiculous. There was no order here. Thankfully, we met up with our hook (who was also helping out 30 other people). We made our own separate line that snaked through the \""mega line\"". \n\nAs our line got closer to the door, all the guys from all the groups were stopped, so all of the girls from our groups could go in. It seemed extremely unorganized compared to just about every other club in Vegas, especially the top tier clubs. The guys had to wait for about 5 extra minutes. I thought for a little bit that we were going to get swindled, but luckily we got inside. For free. The big line had barely moved.\n\nOnce inside, our girls were given 2 free drink tickets and they in turn gave one of their tickets to the guys. However, we were denied at the bar from using the tickets that were for females only apparently. So we gave the tickets back to the girls who got the drinks for us... I couldn't tell if we were outsmarting them or if they were dumber than a sack of rocks. Once I started paying for drinks, the bartenders were on point and I never waited more than 3 minutes to get a drink. I cant say the same for places like Marquee.\n\nThe layout of the club is basically an average size dance floor and a couple bar areas. There is no outside, no craps table, no places to really take a break from dancing.\n\nMeanwhile, they never close off the dance floor, they just let people pile in there like a bunch of sardines. They compound this issue by having ASSHOLE bouncers guard the bottle service tables that lie on the inside of the dancefloor. When I say guard, I mean no holding back. I was literally shoved in the back by a bouncer with a giant stupid Mohawk 3 or 4 times, forcing other people to spill their drinks on me as we collided. This guy was seriously on another level when it comes to bouncers. He was pushing another guy much larger than himself, and he would have gotten his shit rocked if that guy had lost his cool. I may have left a bootprint myself if that had happened.\n\nThe music was top 40 dance remixes with house drops. It was predictable, but still fun out on the dance floor. They also opened up a 2nd, smaller room that was playing hip-hop. The dance floor was much less packed.\n\nOverall this place was a good fun time, but had the potential of being an absolutely horrible night. I can only see myself going again if I can get in for free again.\n\nHope this was helpful."

4,"My husband made reservations at this restaurant for my birthday dinner. We had reservations at 6:30 and had the restaurant to ourselves for a good 45 minutes before any other guests arrived. We had a window table with a fantastic view of the strip from the Stratosphere all the way down to Mandalay Bay, as this restaurant is on the 56th floor of the ivory tower in the Palms Hotel/Casino.\n\nWe arrived and our waiter Salvano greeted us and took our drink orders. We ordered off of the tasting course menu. This menu consist of 7 courses. You have a choice of 3 options for each course including one vegetarian option. So the variations are numerous. My husband and I decided to get different entrees for each course to maximize our experience to taste as much of the menu as possible.\n\nThe first course was a complimentary sampling from the chef. It was pheasant with filo dough wrap, with a strawberry puree, and a cauliflower puree soup. It was a nice surprise to start the evening from the chef.\n\n1st course: Russian Golden Ostera caviar and Truffle caviar.($20 supplement)\n\n2nd course: Ribeye Carpaccio and Maine Lobster and herb salad\n\n3rd course: Sauteed foie gras and Chilled terrine of foie gras\n\n4th course: King crab leg croustillant and Tempura calamari\n\n5th course: Sauteed Dove Sole and Red Snapper\n\n6th course: Aged beef ribeye and Spring rabbit\n\nChef palate cleanser consist of meringue coating around grapefruit puree and poppyseed sauce.\n\n7th course. Gran Marinier souffle and Chocolate souffle.\n\nOverall the dishes were decent size. The variety and flavors in each course made it so unique and delicious. With the foie gras the waiter recommended a glass of Sauternes wine, which was a pairing. The service was impeccable, even when it got busy the wait staff worked as a team to keep up the incredible service. Every waiter was knowledgeable and described in detail each dish as they served it. The view is priceless especially as dusk turned to night and you could see a clear view of the strip lighting up. Awesome!!. Walked out feeling as if we had spent the day at the spa. Totally relaxed and satisfied. Definitely recommend Alize for a very special occasion."
0,The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
3,"I stayed at the Flamingo, and figured that coming here would be a awesome place to get some grub. It may be a little touristy, but who cares.. you aren't from there! I got to Tropical Margarita GUAVA flavor and it was really good. Just a good balance of alcohol, tequila, and guava ! Blended of course! I was feeling a little ill so I ordered the tortilla soup which was pretty okay. My friends ordered the seafood mac and cheese and it had \""perfectly melted cheese both white and yellow cheese with the crisp\"" It was so good they talked about it all weekend. \nIt was also fun to see someone come out of a volcano and slide into a giant pitcher! \nSince it was touristy, prices were not cheap. $10 margaritas, and 20+ for mac and cheese! go figure :)"
0,"-THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED due to a fire-Was disappointed to find a boarded up front entry here today, website says it is closed \""indefinitely\"", but there are several other locations in Montreal."
3,"I am sure it gets better... And when it does, I will let you know. UNTIL THEN this place was Fantastic. \n\nAwesome service, Portuguese speaking staff, food was fantastic and a classy environment. We got there just as they were closing . With a few tables left they seated us and never rushed us. Food assortment of meat was excellent and cooked to your desire. salad bar was fresh and well stocked. \n\nA fantastic dinner in Vegas, thank you !"
2,"I mostly came here for Poke Express. Poke Express is amazing. But as for Island Sushi and Grill...\n\nIt's okay I guess? I got a kalbi and tonkatsu lunch combo, but compared to Island Specialties downtown, there just wasn't very much for the same price.\n\nThere's 3 small pieces of kalbi and one medium piece of tonkatsu, plus Mac or tossed salad for $9 something. Overall decent and what I expected, but could have been more.\n\nAt least service is friendly and they are fast.\n\n3.5 stars"
3,"My first Cirque du Soleil experience, and LOVED IT. \n\nI was never drawn to the idea of spending large amounts of money just to see people do tricks in the area and dance around, but after seeing this awesome show I'm now hooked on Cirque du Soleil shows!  I want to see more!!!\n\nWhat made this show good was that it had a central storyline.  I've seen only one other Cirque du Soleil show, the Love by the Beatles show at the Mirage, which didn't really seem to have much of a plot to it, more like random music videos.  I don't want to spoil the story so I won't say too much...but there was a narrator in the beginning of the show who said a few words to set up the storyline, and after that there were no words spoken in English the entire show.  It's pretty cool how you can still understand the central plot when no words are spoken!  That just speaks to the complexity and greatness of the show (and I guess that's why tickets are so pricy).\n\nThe stage is awesome (it moves!) so they played on that factor a lot for their crazy stunts.  Sometimes they would be doing ridiculous tricks and I would look closer and realize that they're not harnessed to ropes!  WHAT?!\n\nThe theme was also cool, with tribal-like crazy costumes for everyone including the ushers.  Love that everyone stuck to the theme so much!\n\nBottom line: Definitely wowed!"
1,"I love trying out a new sushi place. I wished it was a bit better for me.\n\nArmed with an Amazon deal I purchased for $20 for $40 worth of food, we arrived for dinner on a Saturday night. Not very busy...\n\nOur server and sushi chef was friendly and helpful. As we looked at the menus handed to us and the monitor they had set up with pictures showing a slideshow of their sushi selections, we asked about their rolls. Our server knew some, yet still turned to ask most of what we asked to the sushi chef. I guess the new menu was new to them, too...?? \n\nWe ordered the Shufflin Roll recommended by our server and the James Special. Both were tasty, yet just had a lot going on. Couple different kinds of sauces, different fishes, sometimes a dish has too many things going on. I saw something called Taco Wasabi on their specials board, so I requested one. It was pretty much tako (octopus) chopped in a small bowl with wasabi mixed in. Do not recommend ordering that.\n\nWhen I presented my phone to use my Amazon deal, another employee came to settle our check so we can pay what's leftover after our voucher. I saw our check (what we would've paid) and saw that it added up to about $32. I'm not saying they were obligated to tell us, but all I was thinking was \""Wouldn't that have been nice that they could've told us we still had $8 to use???\"" Or at least tell us what our balance was at. I'm not one to care if we go over a certain amount, especially using a voucher, because I knew we already got a deal. Anyone else understand where I'm coming from?? LOL\n\nI hate giving less than 3 stars, seeing that others did enjoy this place. Maybe I'll try again and write an update..."
2,"Blah Blah,\nInstead of a long review I will say this,\n\nIt's expensive as balls, its crowded, and very obviously a novelty experience more akin to a roller coaster ride than a gun enthusiast location.\n\nEmployees walk around with sidearms and extra ammo (why?!?!), and seem to hate life/ and or treat you like an idiot because you've never fired a machine gun so you must be and idiot.  You don't load the gun, you receive little instruction on how to operate the gun other than the requisite \""squeeze, don't pull\"" and \""feet shoulder width.\""  So when talked to like a novice, I dont take instruction well.  Pull the trigger till the gun goes click, its more fun that way. \n\nHaving been in the military and having fired many guns before, I thought it was all a bit too patronizing.  \n\nBottom line:  You pay a lot ($50) to fire one gun down range at an approximate distance of 25 ft.  The experience will last under 1 minute.\nFor what you pay the service/location/and range should be better.  Its novelty though, and IF YOU ARE UNACCUSTOMED TO SHOOTING, than you may relish in the thrill and simplicity of it all. Where else are you going to shoot a Thompson or a MP-40, full auto, with no prior training? Ppl from the UK and Australia seemed to love it."
4,Their veggie burger is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly !
4,"So I finally got to do the zip line at night and it was soo pretty! I love the lights of Fremont St and the zip line just added to the experience. \n\nIt is CLOSED right now because they are expanding it and I cannot wait to zip line the entire street of Fremont! Not sure when it opens, but hopefully by this summer :)"
2,"Only 8 calories an ounce for yummy creamy indulgence that won't have the buttons popping off your shirt! They have flavors that rotate and for the full fat full flavor seekers they serve Thrifty ice cream as well. I personally feel their small is big enough. Open late, friendly too. Ask for a sample as some flavors are great and others to me are just so so."
1,"Decided to try this place based on the positive yelp reviews.  All in all the trip was a disappointment.  \n\nOur food was mediocre at best; my wife's dish was smothered in peppercorn to the point where she was crunching through the whole thing, completely inedible.  We ordered the skewers of lamb that came unseasoned and very sinewy...  lastly the pan fried buns were like McDonald's hamburgers inside of a bun so much grease that the crispy buns were completely soggy and the grease just poured out onto the plate.\n\nLastly the staff was very unresponsive.  They were sitting in the kitchen in plain sight yet my drink was constantly empty and I couldn't seem to get them interested in coming over.\n\nThe only upside was that there Mongolian beef was quite good and the menu offered quite a bit of selection but it will not be enough to warrant a return visit."
0,"I set up an appointment on WAHOO because my finger nail Got torn back and pulled out, after waiting and arriving they refused service. He said \"" I  dont remove nails, go to the hospital.\"" What's the point of an urgent care if they refuse Non emergency treatments. Since I had to choose a rating they get one star instead of 0"
3,"I had the buta-burger as it was all the flavors that i love...the burger was surprising good! i didnt expect it to be as bomb as it was....i was like 2nd in line and they were crazy fast too, which is always appreciated...my only gripe is that its kinda expensive..other than that, awesome!"
1,"As I noted, if I returned I would update.  Here is that update.  Honestly, the only reason I went back was because I was invited for a birthday celebration - so I basically went for the people and not the restaurant.\n\nAfter my initial review, I was asked to email the company.  After hesitating a couple weeks I finally sent an email to see what they had to say.  To this day I have not received a reply.\n\nThis visit occurred on an \""All You Can Eat Wings\"" Tuesday.  I made the decision to go with the wing special.  The wings are so-so and the flavors are boring. To me it just seems overpriced, especially since they don't include fries anymore - but instead allow you to munch on a sad nacho bar which is never restocked. All of the food just seems pricey at QSL in general.\n\nKnowing that this location and the Concord location are owned by the same company I expected a lot more out of them.  Even though the service and food in Concord is so-so.\n\nThe previous businesses in that location, for some reason, have just failed to succeed.  Hopefully they continue to make it.  \n\nI don't feel the need to return.  You can make your own decisions.\n\nThis is just an honest from-the-heart review (update) from a paying customer."
1,"This place could use more help and workers to really clean the place up and bus tables.  There was only one bus boy and two waiters for such a big place.  The food was barely ok, portion was small as well, not worth the price.  We will not come back there.  It is ridiculous for such a big name as Sam Woo restaurant chain."
1,"Remember the old Wendy's commercial with the old lady asking \""where's the beef?\""\nWell, ditto that...\nWe split the green chili beef chimi and although it tasted pretty good, there were literally three small pieces of beef with virtually no green chilis.\nAs Klohe Kardashian said at her sister's wedding, I give it six f'in months...unless they add some meat to those meals..."
3,Two thumbs up! I am not a big sandwich person but I have to say this place serves really good sandwiches and salads. The bread is fresh and just tastes great. Service is efficient even though it is always packed and there's always a line. Would definitely go back next time I have a craving for the Full Montagu.
0,"The one in Yuma, AZ was better. I had honey BBQ wings for appetizer, which were OK at best. For dinner had black and bleu burger. Didnt read menu close enuff, I guess. For $9 I got a \""slider\"" with bleu cheese dressing squirted on it. The bun was tastey...more of a dinner roll, actually. The burger was disgusting....like it was baked or microwaved or somthing. Service was friendly but slow. Took them 5 minutes to make a gin/tonic while at 40% capacity. The only thing that will drag me back into one of these restaurants is a mandatory work function. A shame since I really wanted to like this place."
3,"I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley."
0,"Bad service! I have been here a few times and it seems like the staff never knows what's going on. I have a Ladies VIP card which no one ever knows what it's for. One time when I came in the door they gave me a red ticket to use for my complimentary drink and the next time I asked if I needed the ticket they said no. \n\nI have been here maybe 4 times and they messed up my bill EVERY time. Even if it was just an appetizer and one drink. Not sure why I kept going back. The last time I went the first THREE beers I tried to order at the bar they were out of. Service is slow. Food tastes good, but nothing spectacular. I actually love the club music they play but it's a weird mixed-up place."
0,"This company does not return calls and does not pick up the dumpster when you order it picked up!  My client called the company to have a dumpster delivered and requested a pick up 3 days later, it was confirmed and yet never picked up.  As their agent who's attempting to get the property on the market I called on my clients behalf 3 times in one day requesting a call back, giving the property address, my phone number and the day (three days prior) when it was supposed to be picked up.\n\nThey never called me back.  They never called my client and looks like I'll be driving out there again tomorrow to see if they did their job.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable company to deliver a dumpster and pick it up- DO NOT CALL Team Clean and Haul- they do not deliver what they say.\n\nT"
2,"What's the difference between Walt Disney and Bing Crosby? ..\n\n..\n\nBing sings and Walt dinsae .\n\nBOOM BOOM!!\n\nThis Disney shop always looks so inviting, they play music out the door and have moving window displays. When I plucked up the courage to take my 20-year-old self in, I wasn't overly excited, however. They have a great selection of toys and plastic things, the smell of plastic is overwhelming, especially in the pencil case corner. I thought I would go and look for a new pencil case - I used to have a Cinderella one that popped out everywhere if you pressed a specific button, I was so cool. However they didn't seem to stock them anymore...they didn't seem to stock anything exciting like that. \n\nMy memories of the Disney Store were exciting, things flying everywhere and talking toys going off on every aisle, but this time the store was quiet, nothing flying around and no excitement. I was disappointed, but put it down to the fact that I was 20, so I took my ex-boyfriend neice with me, and she felt the same! She didn't enjoy it (despite demanding a hannah montana schoolbag) and said she had been in more exciting ones."
3,"Why did I wait so long to try Dickey's?  \n\nMy husband and I visited Dickey's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The smoked meats on the menu are pretty straight forward, pulled pork, beef brisket, sausage, ham, turkey and chicken - all hickory smoked in their onsite pits. Now, I know I'm in North Carolina where pulled pork is king, but I can't pass up brisket. I ordered a 1 meat plate with beef brisket. The plate comes with 2 sides and I chose the baked potato casserole and the fried onion tanglers.  Boy, did I choose right!  You get a hefty portion of meat with a soft roll with pickles and onions. You can also choose from a variety of sauces at the sauce bar.  My husband also got the brisket but got the jalapeno beans and fried okra.  He said he really liked his plate too.  The brisket was tender with a nice smokey flavor. I chose the original bbq sauce and it was the perfect accompaniment.  And to top it all off, everyone gets free soft-serve vanilla ice cream!  It's self serve and it was a great ending to a really great lunch!\n\nThe service was super, super nice and attentive. I've been plotting our next visit. We will definitely be back!  The bakers (stuffed baked potatoes) will be next on my list!"
3,"I love coming to this store to buy cheap kitchen utensils that I use for cooking.....sure grip, teflon utensils are my weapons of choice in the kitchen.  They have them here for decent prices.  \n\nSometimes I buy stuff I use once because it's cool.....like an electric Deli Slicer.....that got used maybe 5 times and is sitting in a box in one of our kitchen cabinets.  Whatever, it's still a fun place to shop.\n\nWill I return?  You bet."
2,The restaurant is cozy and somewhat dark with a separate bar area and dining area. Service was quick and attentive. They have some different beers to experiment with and even let you sample some you're not familiar with before you commit. \n\n\nFood was OK but not great. I had half a turkey sandwich and salad. My turkey sandwich was a bit dry and bland and the salad was forgettable. As bars go and as bar food goes you could do much worse.
4,"Great price for the breakfast deal $4.99 chicken steak & eggs, friendly staff good food and price. Music is little loud. But it is a bar, what can you say right ??"
2,"Came here just for a quick bite to eat. This I Love Burgers is located in the Palazzo Shops, just a few steps away from our hotel elevator at the Palazzo. As soon as we stepped in, the hostess seated us right away but it took the server longer that it should to come over and acknowledge us. I almost got up to leave when she came. While she was pleasant and we didn't wait to long to get our food, wait service wasn't a priority with her since she purposely hid behind the pillars to gab with staff.\n\nWhy I say she did this on purpose?? I was wondering where she was a good five minutes. Mr. B needed a drink refill. I saw her then step out from behind a white pillar at the back of the restaurant  I was about to catch her attention when she jumped back behind the white pillar and kept talking to her co worker. lol...jeez!   I guess her conversation was more important.  The Angus burger sliders and  Mac and Cheese Nom Noms were good. Portion wise just right and prices were your tourist trap prices. I expected that. Just didn't expect inattentive service. So our dining experience for this visit was A-Okay."
2,"It pains me to have to pin this one down, since it's equally easy for me to imagine someone having a 5-star as a 1-star experience at Rain. So here's a menu of ratings depending on who you are and what you're looking for:\n\n5*, if you're in the mood for liquid dancing at LV's best rave, headlined by roughly monthly appearances by larger-than-life Perfecto ringleader Paul Oakenfold.\n\n4*, if you're here on a summer Sunday afternoon for the Cinevegas awards ceremony to hear Trevor Groth, Dennis Hopper and other rockstars of the independent film movement talk about cinema on the edge.\n\n3*, if you're staying at the Palms, played blackjack way later into the night than you said you would, and just couldn't be bothered to jump in a cab to Tao or XS, so you've convinced yourself that the flame throwers and acrobatics are what you really need in a club.\n\n2*, if you trekked out from the strip w/o making sure your door situation was handled and you now find yourself waiting in line on the floor of the not-entirely-classy Palms casino.\n\n1*, if you're partisan to the plush, homey, living-room ultra-lounge coddling that popped up in NYC's meatpacking district a decade ago (http://www.yelp.com/biz/apt-new-york), in LV courtesy of Steve Wynn and Victor Drai (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tryst-las-vegas), and just recently in LA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-house-los-angeles-4). Rain is more like an industrial warehouse, save the 1984 book-burning goth hipsterness of the one on La Cienega that Lenny Nero crawls into in Kathryn Bigelow's chef d'oeuvre Strange Days."
4,This place is bomb!!! Love kimchi fried rice + 4 skewers!! HEAVEN!
4,"This is the best breakfast spot on the strip!  The potions are HUGE. I'm a big eater and my wife and I could share the chicken and waffles. Biscuits and gravy is good too.  We had a large party, but the service great.  We know that large parties can be difficult to please.  Scott ( young red head guy) was EXCELLENT! He even checked on us the next day even though we weren't sitting in his section.  If you come to Vegas you have to eat here!"
1,Cupcakes were decent but nothing I'd go out of my way for. Cake part was more on the dry side and the icing was crazy sweet. I may return but it will only be to try the macaroons.
1,"I must say I was rather disappointed when I called to try and do a tasting for my daughter's party that was needing a cake for at least 50 people. The lady on the phone said that they did not do tastings for cakes that were for 50 people and that they were booked for six weeks out anyway. \n\nMy husband and I used them for our weeding nine years ago and were quite please with the quality of the cake and with the service, but it seems like they no longer care, nor would they have received our business nine years ago since our wedding only was for 50 people. Needless to say, we ended up having to go with another cake place that didn't care if we were serving eight people or 1,000. Customer service is a must now a days! Two stars is for what I remember of their yummy cakes."
4,This place is by far the best Chinese take out place that I gave eaten in. I lived in NY and been to California several times and this place is just as good or better!! You get a lot if food for little money!! They are quick with their deliveries or pick up order as well!! Keep up the good job guys!!!
4,"Love this place! They are always very fast, even during the dinner rush. I highly recommend the Singapore noodles! Yuummm! :)"
4,"I went in to John Mario's a bit skeptical - you never know what you're going to get with any given hair salon. This was the first time I'd had my hair cut in Vegas, so I went completely off of online reviews (like this one). \n\nI requested a fairly challenging hair cut from my barber, Bill. I pulled up a photo of the style I liked on my phone and showed it to him. After studying it and talking it through with me, Bill went straight to work. Watching him work with the clippers was absolutely mesmerizing - you can tell the guy is a pro. I watched in awe as he shaped my raggedy mop into a style nearly identical to the photo I had showed him just 20 minutes earlier. The end result FAR exceeded my expectations! \n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend John Mario's - especially Bill. He's as talented with a pair of scissors and clippers as I've seen, and he can absolutely create the exact look you want."
4,"I am not sure why it took me so long to review Roy's since I have been celebrating special occasions at the restaurant for the past five years. I have yet to have a disappointing experience. The service is consistently strong, staff is always knowledgable and friendly, and the food is amazing.  I usually get the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi and it never disappoints.  I love the sushi here as well. I recently celebrated my birthday here and it was such a wonderful experience. Everyone was very pleased with their food and the service. They even offer an alternative menu for the vegeterians among us if you let them know in advance. I will definitely be returning!"
3,"While not as spacious as Palazzo/Venetian, they do have nice rooms which comparable to Cosmo and the others. It may be the same size or even bigger. \n\nThe difference between Signature and the others is there's a stove and microwave which means you can reheat some leftovers or cook some snacks. It comes in handy.\n\nThe only negative about Signature is it's off strip. I mean, really off strip. The only way to get on strip is to take a long walk through a tunnel which leads to MGM. It's not that bad but MGM is on one end of the strip and when you want to hit up Encore, it's definitely taxi time. Also, there is no casino in here.\n\nThe parking is a little wonky too. You need to be a guest to park here and there's no self-parking, it's all valet.\n\nBesides those little details, it's a nice place to stay. Quiet, but nice."
1,"Unfortunately no one ever asked us how our food was... If they had asked- who knows- maybe they would have made an attempt to be sure we were satisfied! Bizarre rules w/ the menu. For example, \""could I have a side of veggies instead of rice or mashed potato?\"" Response- \""it will cost $6 extra.\"" We did it anyway and were much happier with the grilled zucchini, peppers & mushrooms at an extra $6. I wonder though... Why were there only olives, onions & peppers available in the veggie quesadilla I asked about? Bottom line- I took 2 bites of the tasteless margarita pizza I ordered when the veggie quesadilla sounded too boring, and no one asked if it tasted okay!! Our server also didn't ask if I wanted to take my leftovers with me (is that allowed here? Not sure_ either way though)... I would have let her know I was unhappy. Poor service. Meh food."
1,"My team and I were trolling the strip looking for a place to eat. We decided that a burger would be simple and ideal. We found this French themed burger place inside of the Paris hotel and thought it should be good.\n When we walked up to the doors, we were greeted by a couple of hostesses that were way too ugly to have such a shitty, snooty attitude. They barely acknowledged us and just pointed inside to the bar and said \""seat yourselves\""\n We were too hungry to care so we sat down at the bar and the bartender just seemed tired, overworked and didnt really care about the people. To him, we were just another party crew passing through Las Vegas.\n He handed us all dirty, sticky greasy menus and disappeared for 10 minutes.\nWe finally gave him our drink orders and he was snappy with his response and seemed so annoyed by us, the people who tip. \n When I ordered my Guinness, he just poured it in the pint, one pour and let it sit and settle by itself. Any self respecting bartender would NEVER pour a pint of Guinness so poorly. If I were a manager or the establishments owner, I would give him his walking papers just for his lack of respect to Guinness and the art of the \""Perfect Pour.\"" I let that slide in hopes that the food would be great.\n  \nI ordered the Blue Cheese burger and when it finally came out, I sank my teeth into it and, while it was a tasty burger, it was without a doubt the greasiest thing I have eaten in very long time. \n It had disrupted my stomach that I could not even eat it anymore. It was heavier by the grease and not by the meat. Huge bun designed to fill you up and distract you from the fact that youre eating a greasy pile of beef in a huge doughy bun.\n  I perhaps wouldnt have been so disappointed by this if the $15 burger at least came with french fries, but I left with a stomach ache and never a desire to return.\n\nI would never recommend this place. If you want to eat a burger. Do NOT go here.\nThere is a Fatburger right down the strip and is worth the extra time/distance walking."
2,"two words, convenient (if you are on the center of the strip) and expensive (since you are on the center of the strip). yuk gae jang is my preference for after drinking. they make it decent here. the service is good, the server was pretty attentive. everything is extra like a second serving of rice. open 24 hrs."
2,"I really want to love this place so badly. I moved into the Cheery Lynn Historic neighborhood about three years ago and have watched several places fail. I've hoped somebody would buy this cute little place and make it into something great. \n\nSo, my husband, son and I went yesterday with high hopes and hungry bellies. We've been looking forward to trying it since we got a menu on the door the other day.\n\nI hope as they move into their new space, they update the decor and get rid of some of the previous owners' decor. Such a big part of going out to eat, is the ambiance. The building is so cute and there's so much potential for it, but what the original Two Hippies owner did was just plain awful.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I am unfortunately sad to report that it was just not that good. My first \""beef\"" is the beef. I originally posted that I had thought they used frozen patties, but received the nicest reply stating that they do get their meat locally and it is never frozen. Perhaps we just came on a bad day. I ordered the Loco Moco and I had to cut my hamburger patty with a knife and fork. I was also excited to try the homemade macaroni salad, but again... not so good. It was more of a mayonnaise-macaroni soup. Way to runny for my taste. But that's just me. My husband got a burger and it was okay. The best thing we got was my son's hot dog. It was just a plain hot dog with ketchup but it was pretty tasty. I'm thinking that when I go back (and I definitely will so I can give them another chance and I can support my neighborhood joint), I'm going to get one of those hot dogs. They have all sorts of exciting options for hot dogs including homemade chili (my favorite).\n\nThey do have really delicious strawberry lemonade and tropical iced tea. \n\nI feel bad writing anything bad because I'd really like to see the new owners succeed. They were exceptionally friendly and welcoming. They responded to my original post and were very, VERY sweet so I know once they work out all of their kinks, they will do well."
3,"Normally the boy does not enjoy museums, but he had a lot of fun in this one.\n\nLots of historic sex toys and insane sex toys. Video clips, films, demonstrations. Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\n\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive."
1,The service of our waitress was very rude and not professional.  Sat for 20min never came back to take our order. Food didn't taste good. It was too salty.
4,"Okay, before I can even say anything about the sandwiches here.. You MUST know that their potato salad is EXACTLY what I call a potato salad!! It's that kind with a hint of vinegar. It's a wonderful contrast to the sweet potato chunks (just the way I like it).\n\nSo, the name is cute and catchy. Me and my friends were hungry. And being hungry makes it all-the-more daring to try something new on a demanding stomach. I like hot sandwiches to of course warm my lonely belly. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich. OMG my mouth just watered. Honestly it was worth trying. The Sandwiches here are filling and full of flavor. I'm pretty sure there's a sandwich for everyone."
4,"Fresh Sushi, Fresh Sushimi rolls, best Udon soup you can get in Madison ( and this is a buffet) Frog legs, Tamuri mushrooms, shrimp, and the Sunday seafood buffet is Unbelievable, even for the $20 per person price tag, it's well worth it. Fresh Wasabi too, plus Ice cream scooped out for you , not soft serve."
3,"I went to Bayleaf  with a foodie Indian friend who thinks its the best in the city. At our table three got the buffet, I got Chicken Lawabdhar, my sister got Butter Almond Chicken. We ordered samosas as appetizer. With the buffet you get freshly made masala dosai. The buffet consisted of several main dishes, veg and non-veg, two soups and a lot more for $6. the chicken dishes were delicious, as were the dosai and samosa,  the rice was perfect...by far our new favorite. One thing we really liked was the food was not greasy, just fresh and delicious! It is also much more affordable- and they deliver."
2,"Great ambience.  Sat out on back patio.  Felt the waitress was a bit snooty.  I think the concept of the food is great, but not so great in execution.  The guacamole everyone raved about \""made tabelside\"" was made over in a corner and brought over to the table already made.  I would have liked to watch them make it.  Was just about one large scoop and that was it.  Left us wanting more, but flacor wasn't really there.  Underseasoned and overpriced at $12.00.  And the chips were undercooked so crunchy onthe outside, but tought toward the middle.  The chicken skewers with mole sauce was dry and mole was just ok.  The sweet potatoe/french fries were just like any other restaurants, but loved the sauces.  Tacos (ckicken) were just ok.  \nThe much acclaimed pumpkin bread pudding was excellent, but only about a 3 inch square.  Just a teaser size.\n\nI think if you don't mind spending the money, can get by the snooty waitress, and want to try something different, go for it.  Everyone in the area said to try Los Olivos right around the corner for really good Mexican food."
4,"Delicious food - eloquent, classy atmosphere and impeccable service. It's pricey but I don't mind paying for good food. There are also happy hour specials if you sit at the bar before 7."
4,"Vieux-Port Steakhouse is one of my favorite places.  I eat there whenever I'm in Montreal, sometimes more than once.  It's a beautiful restaurant, and in warm weather their outdoor terrasse makes for one of the loveliest dining experiences you can have.  Perfect for a date or a special night out with friends.  Great food, service and ambience - perfect."
4,"If you are near downtown Las Vegas (or have a car to drive there) you must try these donuts.  The Lemon is filled with the same tart lemon as a lemon bar.  The Peach is filled with peach cream and topped with crumble.  Can't wait to try the chocolate.  Take these to friends, family or co-workers.  One note - the entrance is on Carson not Sixth."
4,"My husband and I own a timeshare and decided to trade it in for staying at the Grand Chateau. I had read reviews that there was construction going on, but when we went, they were working on the inside of the rooms so we never had any noise issues.\n\nThe location is great! It's located on the southern side of the Strip right by the Miracle Shops/Planet Holleywood. They have a shuttle service that'll get you about mid-strip and drop you off at the Fashion Mall which would often times spare our feet.\n\nThe rooms were lovely. Granite counter tops, copper sinks, jacuzzi tub, duel shower heads, flat screen tv, I seriously couldnt complain. The wifi was really shoddy, but I was able to get online and make reservations while we stayed there.\n\nThey dont have a casino and are 100% smoke free which is awesome because I cant STAND the smell of cigs and it's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and lay your head down to peace and quiet.\n\nThey have a small convenient store with overpriced items, but sometimes when you dont want to make the walk, it's nice to have one there. We didnt check out the pool as it was Feb when we went and much too cold so I cant comment on that. Service was always excellent and we'd DEFINITELY stay here again!"
2,I come here a lot. Like that they have cheap matinees and offer a variety at snack bar. Like that they have the automated ticket machines.
4,I love Aloha Animal Hospital!  They have been so friendly and accommodating!  Every time I go in I feel very comfortable to talk to Dr Zimmerman about any questions or concerns I have and she is always very thorough in explaining and answering any questions.  They are so sweet to my pups and always leave a chocolate for us humans! Love love love them!
4,"Be warned: Their sweet potato fries will haunt your dreams. They're so delicious and perfect and will call your name whenever you smell a french fry. \n\nActually... I think it's safe to say that everything on their menu will haunt you in your dreams. I've never had anything not delicious and craveable. Throw a dart at the menu and I will guarantee that it is delicious. Don't even think about splitting something with a friend because you will destroy your friendship. \n\nThe service is always on point, their bartenders are hilarious, and the ambiance is amazingly energetic.\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. Please move it to the Bay area. But until then, I will have to fly to Phoenix just to get my fix."
4,"Healthy, Tasty, Fast, Cheap, what's not to love.  Awesome for mall food for sure!"
2,"Probably the most basic of all the Station properties with the Oyster Bar being the best reason to come here. The steak restaurant is a pretty decent deal for lunch too. Cheap rooms, gambling, buffet, drinks etc. \n\nI dislike the fluorescent lighting in the poker room. It makes me feel like I am in a high school biology class. I do like the sports bettors parking spots which gives action junkies a close place to park to put in their bets.\n\nThis isn't a bad place if you're on a budget and have a vehicle but I would still opt for Fremont St if I were here on an el cheapo trip to LV."
4,I happened upon this restaurant by accident. I stopped in for a tempura shrimp roll & ended up getting the ALL U CAN EAT. You can't beat this deal. The fish is so FRESH and the VARIETY was more than I ever expected. You have to go. The staff is friendly & very attentive. I personally sit @ the Sushi Bar as opposed to a table. Your Sushi Master is right there @ your service & they make the greatest suggestions. The one price covers everything except your beverage & it truly ALL U CAN EAT.\n\nIf you want great sushi and more for your money......YAMA SUSHI is the place to sit back & enjoy the menu.
4,"We had the pleasure of staying her for three nights in September and it just might be my new favorite place to stay in Vegas.\n\nWe normally stay on the strip, in fact our trip in April had been for a week at the Palazzo. This time we had my boyfriend's parents with us, visiting from England. They were not interested in gambling, so we thought that it would be nice to stay somewhere quieter and Tahiti Village fit the bill.\n\nWe had adjoining rooms that were absolutely massive. Our room was the bigger of the two, but they each had a kitchen area and living room. Our room had a Jacuzzi tub and a shower that converted to a steam room. So cool. The kitchens have a full size fridge and stove and had any appliance or utensil that you might need to cook dinner. The rooms were beautifully appointed and clean. \n\nThe pool is hands down the best in Vegas. It's a huge complex and we never had to worry about not being able to find a lounge chair during peak times. The  pool was full, but never felt crowded, because it was so big. I loved the lazy river. It's relaxing with just the right amount of waterfalls. Tahiti Village does not charge for tube rentals either. The pool bar had strong, cheap drinks. \n\nI really can't find a single negative about this resort. I can't wait to stay here again. Next time we are going to buy steaks and take advantage of the huge BBQ area. \n\nAfter three nights in Tahiti Village, I felt like I had spent a week in Hawaii!"
4,"I recently went here for my first time and was blown away. I absolutely loved their Green Tea smoothie. The staff was exceptional, and after hearing that it was my first time, the lady gave me a $1 off coupon and explained their punch card system to me. I will def. be returning here."
2,"OK for a Starbucks. It's very busy, which makes it noisy and the staff hurried. The furniture, especially the armchairs, are comfortable and a decent place ti sit and read."
2,"The mainstay driving my 2-star rating is the fact that they had NO water in any of their vending machines or at the food counter. In Arizona, you must, must serve water. They had old brewed tea and Power aid drinks, but fundamentally, I can't believe they didn't have water.\n\nBatting Cages- Good\nGolf Driving Range- Good\nBumper Boats- Water was not clean and looked gross\nMini-golf- Okay\nGo Carts- Seats were really torn up and a lot of the cars didn't work\n\nThis place is operating on a thread. Minimal staff and they drained every fountain in the park to save on money. I can't totally blame them for that."
2,+_+_+_+_+ Logan's is many kangaroo hops ahead of that Australian place +_+_+_+_\n\n      Met friends for a movie and dinner. \n      The steak I and my wife had were $11.99 \n      I wasn't expecting much for this price.\n\nI'm shocked ....... the meal was outstanding.\nThe steak was tender .... tasty .... and juicy.\nFor my two sides ...... I chose a Caesar salad and fries.\nThe fries were very good.\nNext time ..... I would take a pass on the Caesar salad ...... taste wise it lacked zest and was flat.
2,"I have dined here a handful of time. The service is good, no complaints there. But the food hasn't blown me away yet. My boyfriend and I are lovers of the Bruschetta but everything else we have tried just didn't quiet cut it. The Tuna Melt is OK but lacks originality. The drinks however usually don't disappoint although on our last visit the Sangria was terrible. I am not sure if the bartender made it wrong but it was way too sweet and not nearly enough wine was in it. I had to send it back and go with a Mojito that was OK. \nI will say that I do love the concept and the setting of the establishment. It has a good vibe and great for Happy Hour!"
4,"Sadly I moved and don't go here but, this gym is great. Good price and lots of equipment. But, its small and never too crowded. Open 24 hrs so you can work out whenever."
4,"Bam!  That's how excited I am to write this review.  I've had Cafe Du Jour bookmarked \""To Try\"" for over a year, and I'm angry I haven't come sooner.  We had one of our best dinners in the 'burgh the past two years.  \n\nIt was sold to me as a French Bistro - but it's really not.  None of the items are classic French comfort food, such as a coq au vin, duck confit, pate, or other type of items.  I think it falls in the New American cuisine.  Correction, it is delicious New American cuisine.  Soy-glazed meatballs ($10), pork, apple butter and brie crostini ($10), fennel rubbed pork chop with crispy kale($24), chicken breast stuffed with feta and spinach ($24), are some of the items that I can recall.\n\nThere isn't a website, and the menu you can find on allmenus seems to be a lunch menu, and outdated.  I wouldn't let that deter you at all - you just have to trust your fellow Yelpers who rave about this place.  I do disagree on the $$ designation.  Two people with 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 desert, and a cork fee was $86 (and $100 adding tip).\n\nNow, it is small, or at least while the patio is closed.  8 tables or so, and only 4 staff it seemed.  One host/waiter/runner, one chef, one sous chef, and an extra hand.  The pace between our courses was a bit longer than usual, but it didn't really bother me like it usually does.  The staff is working hard, and you can see it, and the food is so good I didn't really care.  And as mentioned elsewhere, BYOB with $2/stem.\n\nThis restaurant needs to be the next place you go."
2,"Okay, if you're looking for a genuine Chicago Vienna Beef Red Hot or a NY Sabrett street cart dog; then you might not  understand Hot Dog Stop. HDS does sever Sabrett's but this is more of a gourmet hot dog place. \n\nThe portions are very generous to say the least and very tasty. The folks who run the place are from France and have put their own spin on things. So if you're fixed on what a hot dog should be, then go to Luke's, or Al's or even A & W; but if you want 'something completely different, to borrow a phrase, then by all means try HDS.   \n\nEnjoy!"
2,"Took dad here after golf one day thinking it would be something a little divey and would be good in sweaty golf clothes. I think we were both surprised to see how trendy it was. The menu was great, and I really liked being able to design your own sliders... it gives you a chance to try a few different things. I had the beef with bacon, swiss, lettuce, and jalapeno aioli and it was very tasty. I agree with other reviews though, that it was overcooked. The buffalo, I had how they recommended and it was un-frikin-beleivable. There was some sort of sweet chutney on it that made the burger. I'd go back for that alone. Dad ordered the onion rings and I tried a few, they were delicious as well. Not greasy, not soggy, just right. The wait staff did seem like a bunch of rookies, our waiter even turned the baseball game on 20 minutes after we asked him to and then stated \""oh yeah I just remembered, you want to watch the game, right?\"" The food also took a while to get out to us, like 20-25 minutes long, for 3 sliders and onion rings I thought that was pretty crazy. The waitress dropped a cup of aioli next to me and scared the crap out of some people when she said OH NO! loud enough to be heard outside. We also noticed the big Delux sign across the street where they are opening up, so Stax better get it together or Delux will run them out of town. \n\n+1 for the great food +1 for a good mix of music -2 for lousy/slow service that started in the kitchen."
2,"I enjoyed this cute new spot at the district.  Service was great and outdoor seating was perfect with a view of the musician and lights in the district courtyard.  The strawberry beer was delicious.  My favorite appetizer was the sausages in the puff pastry, so yummy!  We also had the pretzel bite, fries and wings which were okay but the puff pastry was by far my fav.  Nice spot for happy hour and to enjoy a nice vegas fall night out in a relaxed atmosphere."
2,"BLUF: You get what you pay for.  Excessive Chip Repair = Excessive Orange Peel\n\nTook my car here to get a paint job.  I had no significant body damage other than minor chips in the paint.  I did have significant oxidation to the hood and the roof.  I was painting the car the same factory stock color.\n\nThe positive: The cars paint job is a vast improvement to what was on the car prior to the paint job.  \n\nThe negative: Massive Orange Peel all over the car!  The excessive chip repair I paid for only covered most chips according to the informative panel on the wall of the shop which they were happy to show me after I showed them the remaining \""excessive\"" chips.  In fact, I'm convinced that the excessive chip repair is done by fixing the big chips, and the smaller chips are fixed by spraying on the paint on thick which causes for excessive orange peel which help to hide the chips.  Since I didn't pay for the \""deluxe package\"", I'm stuck with the orange peel paint job.  They took off the emblems and didn't put them back on.  I asked the manager if they kept them, he said they were in the glove box.  I should have checked it before I left, but I didn't.  I came home, checked and of course they were nowhere to be found.  Contacted the manager multiple times and they have yet to locate them.  They also pained over my plastic air dam at the front of the car, which was black, but now matches the car color.  \n\nI understand that when I go to Maaco I can't expect the greatest quality.   But I feel like they didn't care about me or my car to do a thorough job to where I would feel I got my money's worth.  These guys need to know that it's the attention to detail that really impresses people enough to recommend their business to others.  Unfortunately, I cannot.  The car's badges are going to cost almost $200 to replace if they don't find them.  If they find them or replace them, I'll up my rating to 3 stars.\n\nUpdate:  They found them.  I had to show up so that they would take me seriously.  So I'm upping it to 3 stars."
2,"Honestly, I've had better turon. \n\nTuron.. what is that? It's a fat looking ripe banana that is wrapped in .. wrapper like a pig in a blanket. It is deep fried and then covered with caramelized sugar. There is also jackfruit inside of this crunchy concoction. I recommend eating Turon, but maybe buying it from another place."
