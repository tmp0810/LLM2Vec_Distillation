2,"Couple of things. #1: This is NOT a kid-friendly museum. LOTS of murder photos.\n#2: If walking here from Fremont St., be aware of your surroundings. It was 11am and there were all sorts of shady characters about. Shady for Las Vegas, too!\n\nThis museum is m.e.t.i.c.u.l.o.u.s. and BIG\n\nWe expected to spend an 1.5-2 hours in the museum, but that's how much time we spent on ONE floor (the museum is comprised of 3 floors).\n\nThe displays are beautifully done-- nicely designed and high quality (graphic designers notice these things).... but there just seemed to be a lack of STUFF. Artifacts. Oh there was a ton of information, sometimes presented in odd ways in what seemed to be an attempt to \""fill space.\""\n\nWe were all mobbed out after two and a half hours and skimmed through the last half of it.\n\nI love museums and sniff them out wherever I go, but this place could use a little editing. :)"
1,"It's a standard Super 8 two star. Clean enough, nothing fancy, and some funny smells here and there. Sirens outside throughout the night. The night clerk said a few things that didn't make sense and were confusing. The thin door to the next room let me hear the dude coughing all night. These are all pretty standard for this type of hotel, but all together I'd probably consider staying somewhere else if I had to stay another night."
1,"This place specializes in reheated pizza.\n\nThey have a sign now that says all pizza they serve has been made within the last two hours.  But, I ate their one evening, and sat there for 2 hours.  During that entire time, they only remade one of the 6 half-pizzas that were sitting out.\n\nIf you ask what is fresh, they always tell you that everything is fresh.  My next question is what do they have that doesn't need to be reheated in a microwave or toaster oven.  They usually suggest something, but then tell me that it needs another \""5 minutes\"" before it is ready.  \n\nThe place is a joke.  If you want real NY style pizza, you are in the wrong town.  I'm giving them a second star only because I know of no other NY style pizza places in town."
4,"Very nice staff! It would be not only for the best chocolate to enjoy the shopping experience there.\n\nGodiva chocolate in my opinion is the best chocolate, but also one of the most expensive."
1,"I don't know where to start. Walking into this Putters it seems like your regular mid to low class almost but not quite a Dive Bar (this can be good/fun if done right but this location doesn't exactly hit the mark).\n\nWhen you walk in everything seems normal and pleasant. About 8 locals sitting at the bar trying their hardest to forget about life for awhile. The Bartender is quick to great you with a smile and I took a seat. It was at that time I noticed a live lobster tank set up as a game. Put your money in and go fish, if you catch one they will cook it for you. I'm no PETA freak and I love seafood but I couldn't talk myself into gambling with having a non seafood restaurant cook a live Lobster for me.\n\nWhen my Fianc\u00e9 and her friend arrived they started gambling. They lost a good $50 and had two drinks a piece. Not a single comped drink for either of them. Only one of them had a winning game on the poker machines; A whole ten cents.\n\nOur food, well I ordered their version of the Supreme pizza it didn't impress my inner Pizza Parlor snob. Way too many olives, not enough cheese, and my pizza was served 15 mins after my Fianc\u00e9es Greek pizza. She didn't like hers at all but when she put a slice of her pie on mine she said it was pretty good and wished she had followed my lead. Her friend desperately wanted dessert but there was nothing in stock.  \n\nHer friend was ordering the fancy Cosmo/fruity drinks and the bartender kept having to send the cook next store to buy milk, fruit etc to make the drinks. Sitting there I googled the store and found this was the location that was on Mystery Diners. Now if we could just get Robert from Restaurant Impossible there they might just get a chance to succeed.\n\nI'm never afraid to try somewhere new but I won't be back."
2,"First experience, I wasn't particularly impressed. It's okay, plain and simple. It can be a bit greasy at times. I always get the pizza when I go there, I have no problem with it. It's not the best nor the worst I've ever had. \n\nThe customer service is usually pretty quick, never had to wait more than a few minutes if there's a line."
4,"I've been here twice in the last year, and am happy to say that both times were incredible. The last time was on my birthday, when my wife set up a very nice dinner for two and we had the Chef's Tasting with the wine pairing. Like others who have reviewed Legume, we found our service to be excellent, and enjoyed the presentation of each course.\n\nThe food here is absolutely flavorful and delicious. It's the kind of place that can almost make you consider licking your plate when nobody's watching you. (Not that I did that, but I wanted to... luckily there was bread to help me take full advantage of the sauces...) Every item was perfectly cooked and delicious - from our fish course, through the lamb carpaccio, to the dessert finale, all of the proteins and garnishes were complimentary to each other and well prepared.\n\nThe only minor \""flaw\"" was that they feel the need to maximize their space by putting a table for two right next to the doors to the kitchen - now, Legume is not the concept restaurant where you sit in full view of the kitchen, so this seems like a little bit of an afterthought. The problem for us was that in an otherwise quiet, slightly dark and romantic space, we were seated in a bright and somewhat loud section. I would have rather waited for another table in the main part of the restaurant; it would have paired better with the overall culinary experience. That being said, the food was so good here that I am not docking any stars for this...\n\nWill definitely return."
2,"This is a 3.5 stars, rounded down to a 3. It's solid, down home brunch food that's done well. We came here over Father's Day Sunday, so it was very busy. Being that it was just my husband and myself, we didn't have to wait very long to get seated at all. I have a feeling that it's always pretty busy- the kind of food they serve appeals very much to the suburban crowd of North Phoenix.  \n\nI'm not sure where they used to be, but this is their new location. It's really nice, done in the style of modern lodge I guess. Lots of wood, but a bit sleeker. They have a full bar, so we were able to have beer and mimosas with our lunch, which I certainly appreciated! \n\nThe menu is solid, good and filling. Most anything you'd find at a Denny's you'd find here. I built my own omelette- an egg white omelette with peppers, spinach and chorizo. This was a winner- I've never had the option to add chorizo, and the spices in it made the omelette truly outstanding. They also have these giant, fluffy home made biscuits that are pretty awesome. It always comes with big dipping bowls of creamy gravy to dip into. It's a bit runnier than I'm used to with gravy, but it still tasted pretty wonderful. \n\nNot something you should go out of your way to check out, but if you're in the area do stop by. You probably won't be disappointed, as long as you don't set your expectations too high."
1,"All flash, no substance. That goes for the service as well as food.  You can say the waitstaff was trained to hear, not listen.  Our waiter failed to mention that the vegetarian dishes listed w/the tasting menu can be ordered a la carte until we asked whether they have side dishes.  When I pointed to the warm corn terrine, he instead brought the foie gras.  Big difference.  When we alerted the staff, they just said, 'well, i can take it back or you can eat it.'  Which the rest of the party did. And was charged. The corn terrine never appeared.  Did I mention that I told him specifically that I'm pregnant and couldn't have certain foods (to my sadness), such as foie gras, soft cheeses, rare meat. A full conversation.  But apparently, he isn't paid to listen.  Because   my medium filet (again, no rare meat) was presented still mooing. After it was sent back, it came back still kicking around.  AT that point, I just ate the end piece and was done with it.  Look, if that particular kitchen usually goes the rarer side, you need to tell the diner, and she/he will order appropriately.  Onto dessert; what a dissapointment.  Half the dessert menu requires that you order it 25 minutes prior.  This included the souffle.  Which was gelatinous.  The entire table had a taste and wouldn't eat the remaining.  \n\nI eat out.  A lot. And I've been to some of the best restaurants in the world, and not all of them expensive (that falafel joint in Marais (Paris)!) but Alize should really just give up already.  The 'we're so tech-forward' iPad wine menu (lame) and the view (lovely) can't save this place.  This is one of those places where insecure men take their ignorant dates with thoughts on impressing them with an expensive French menu and view.  There are so many great French restaurants in Vegas; if you want to impress, go to Joel Robuchon, Bouchon, Guy Savoy. Don't even bother with this place. And btw, half the people at dinner had a case of dinner regret the next day on their flights back home, if you know what I mean.."
0,The name says everything. The sashimi portion are small and expensive. Not a fan of all u can eat sushi bars. Service for get it. Pass on this bomb.
0,"My wife and I were sent on a famous \""Starbucks Run\"" last Saturday for the family. We remembered the new location, and were super excited to be able to check it out. However, when we got there we were less than pleased. As mentioned, this Starbucks definitely is not as fast as others, but we felt that was excusable, because it is a brand new location; they probably have some kinks to work out. But what was not excusable was the MESS (also mentioned in another review, barista area was filthy, covered in spills. It didn't seem like anyone was worried about cleaning up either.) and the HORRIBLE customer service. Curtis was making our drinks, and he clearly can not handle a stressful situation, which probably means he shouldn't be working at Starbucks; but that's beyond the point. We ordered just 5 drinks (no crazy orders, either) and the location at this time was not to busy (7PM on a Saturday); every employee looked confused and were clearly lacking communication skills with each other. As the drinks came up (slowly) I started grabbing them to get them out of the way, and as I grabbed a drink, Curtis shouted rudely, \""YOUR WELCOME.\"" with a roll of the eyes. I then went up for the last drink, and asked if we could get a drink carrier; instead of making any eye contact, Curtis sighed, and shouted \""NOW WE NEED A DRINK CARRIER, CAN SOMEONE GET IT.\"" a manager shouts back that they are out, so he turns to us and shrugs his shoulders while saying \"" We're out.\"" Thankfully a manager offered us a box, because clearly Curtis wasn't concerned. Getting frustrated, we thanked the manager and made a comment referencing Curtis' lack on interest in helping us, and his response (in front of the manager) was \"" SORRY FOR OUR BUSYNESS. THANKS, BYE.\"" Not only am I appalled that an employee would ever treat a customer like this; I am completely shocked that an manager would not address the issue, and apologize for her employees lack of social skills. This Starbucks needs managers that know how to manage and keep their employees under control. So far, I am completely turned off from this location. And it seems as if I am not the only one; as we were leaving another customer made a comment to us asking, \""What was up with that? That guy must forget that he is there to make drinks, be polite and smile, huh?\"" We all agreed we will stick to the Starbucks in Barnes and Noble."
2,"First time eating at an In & Out Burger.  I've heard people rave about them, and after trying them, don't really know why.  They have 3 things on their menu, burger, fries, drink.  I walked in, looked at the menu, and thought I must have missed something.  I was just there to grab a quick burger, so I placed my order, then waited over 10 minutes for it to be made.  The drive-thru line stretched throughout the parking lot, so they were busy, but it took longer than I was expecting (for what was really just a burger and fries).  It wasn't bad, but wasn't anything special either.  Really, the lack of menu options is what surprised me the most..."
4,Definitely worth a visit!  I had the salted butter and nutella combo...wow it was good. I had never had butter ice-cream before and now I will seek it out.
2,"The first thing I noticed when I walked in is that the building is very well designed. So for architecture I give Z Tejas a strong grade. \n\nI'll be honest, I wasn't that excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. The Richardson's/Rokerji/Dick's Hideaway people do Southwest food about as well as it can be done and all are within an easy walk of Z. Neighborhood bar? I'll take any number of places including the Garage across the street. I'm just not sure where Z Tejas fits. \n\nThe food is exactly what you would expect, pretty good, not great. If you have friends in town from rural Washington/Nebraska/Minnesota, this will be exotic and outside their comfort zone from a flavor standpoint. Arizona people might think a little... Meh. I do like that they section out their menu to show the vegetarian listings, always a positive to make things easier on the diners. \n\nThe southwest slaw (I think that's what it's called) was one of the worst things I've ever had. It tastes like somebody took cole slaw and added all the black pepper they could find. I like pepper so I can only assume this was a mistake or designed for a consumer that has almost no sense of taste."
4,Don't let the neighborhood or outside scare you. The place is Great! Amazing unique Mexican cuisine.
4,I had one of the top 5 meals I ever had at Bouchon. Everything I tried was excellent. I even tried things I would never think of ordering (I went with a group so we shared a few starters) and even they amazing. Geat food. Try the pork belly for starters.
3,Get the tacos! They are awesoooome!
2,"We had the wristbands to go to several buffets, but staying in the Palazzo we got a little lazy the second day and went here instead of walking further down. The food here is pretty much the same as other buffets but the service was super slow.\n\nMy husband I ate breakfast here twice and both times the refills never came. We watched our waitress talking to another table about fashion. I stopped a different waitress and she said I had to wait for our waitress. okay. \n\nFinally, she came back for refills about the time we were leaving. I don't think I'd go back here just based on the slow refills, call me picky, but those buffets are not cheap. If you don't opt in for the wrist band, which pays for itself in basically two meals, then show your Harrah's card and get a discount. \n\nThey were cool enough the morning our wristbands were expired to give us lunch at breakfast pricing because it was about five minutes after they stopped serving it."
3,"Got in for free while registered for the posing audition, so no complain.\nI posed today!\n\nPS: Get a brazilian wax if you plan to pose nude. See my list where I get it done in Northern California."
3,Better thank Subway by a mile. However it's just a sandwich. A good sandwich though. If you are in the mood for a cold cut sandwich you can't go wrong here. The bread is fresh and the quality of the meets and cheeses are better than most other sandwich shops. When I'm in the mood for a sandwich POS is usually my 1st choice.
4,"hands down right now...  My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  The room is fabulous.  Very sleek.  If you sit at the counter, you can view the chefs at work in the kitchen.  \n\nI have been twice.  The first time i had the short summer tasting menu - but it was a tad rushed because i had a flight to catch. \n\nThe second time, I went with 6 of my friends and we all had the longer tasting menu - i think it was called L'Exploration or something.  and we did a wine pairing.  the somelier can pick and choose a wine pairing based on your price point.  it was amazing.  Every dish was tasty.   \n\nIts been a while but my highlights were langoustine carpaccio, stuffed quail, and his extreme buttery mashed potatoes that come in a mini creuset.  There are so many more...  I highly recommend a tasting menu!  :D"
1,"Rather disappointed in this place actually. Food was good, not amazing , but good. But portion size , topped with poor service made it a place we'll skip when picking a quick dinner out. I don't get their menu. Food and sides don't go together really, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. When we were ordering, it seemed as if we were bothering her, which was slightly awkward. Overall, not a good experience. Cool name, but not relative to the food at all. I'd say skip this place."
4,Tried a few of the manicurists here before I settled with Cecilia. Meticulous quality!
2,"My newly wedded wife and I were really looking forward to enjoying a great meal at Craftsteak.  We are both fans of Tom Colicho on Top Chef and it was going to be a treat.  However, we were quite a bit disappointed.\n\nThe restaurant itself was very nice and had a great ambiance.  I loved the decoration and the way the restaurant was laid out.  It had a very open floor plan but was very quiet.  The tables and chairs were awesome!  \n\nWe had the fall tasting menu for $75/person which consisted of the hanger steak, the wagyu steak, and the scallops.  The presentation of the dishes were in very nice looking skillets and the steaks and the scallops looked absolutely delicious.  However, when we started tasting it, I have to admit that the best dish was not the wagyu steak but the hanger steak.  The wagyu steak was cold and chewy.  I had expected a \""melt in your mouth\"" sensation but didn't get any of that.\n\nAll the other dishes were great.  The appetizers were very good and the desserts were very good as well.  However, their signature steak dish really disappointed me.\n\nThe main reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars was really the service.  When we were first seated, we got great service.  Our water was never empty and our server was very attentive.  About 1 hour into our dinner, 2 large groups came and sat down in the tables next to ours.  From that point on, I could not get anybody's attention and had to consistently ask for water or service.  That was very disappointing for such a top rated restaurant.  Incidentally, I felt that I got better service at the Burger Bar at Mandalay bay."
2,"Finally decided to go here, after seeing the Flamingo sitting in the same spot for YEARS.\n\nThis is your typical chinese place. It's not flashy, like PF Changs, which is a good thing in my eyes.\n\nThe decor is what you would expect. Nothing flashy. Giant fish in a fish tank, that wanted to eat me.\n\nThe food is where it gets a little sketchy. We started off with the PuPu Platter, which was tasty. Eggroll, Honey Crispy Chicken, steak skewers, and fried shrimp were all delicious. My house special chicken ( a breast with white/dark meat deep fried and served with a sweet-garlic sauce) was tasty, but rather greasy. Made for great leftovers! \n\nSarah has the calamari, and that was a huge mistake. They kept on the filament  that exists on the calamari, and that made it incredibly chewy and hard. Blegh. Terrible.\n\nService was great. But really, I've had much better, Abacus Inn is miles above Flamingo."
2,"-Slow service (I think they were catering to phone calls first, there was only 3 people in the establishment and it took 40 mi\n-Super busyyyyyy (inside & phone calls)\n-Lots of indoor seating\n-Awesome wings\n-Pizza is a-ok. I've had a lot better.. super doughy & super greasy - be prepared with napkins\n-Customer service is whatever, definitely nothing special.\n-Lots of parking\n-They seem to have a lot of regulars since it got busy after we got our food... seemed like a hole-in-the-wall, family, local kinda spot.\n\nWe were in town getting my car fixed and was craving pizza. I probably won't be back here since I'm not from the area, but it satisfied the pizza craving."
4,"My little perforated, syrup-filled heart is full every time I come here!\n\nIt has great food and it's not too expensive. Mondays they have \""Magic Monday,\"" where you can get the breakfast magic waffle (bacon, cheese, egg on top) for $4 (maybe $5? I forget). \n\nThis place also might have my favorite breakfast potatoes in the whole city. Yeah, I said it. They are just like I want them to be: crispy on the outside and pillow-y soft on the inside, just like a french fry. This gal's no fan of soggy home fries. \n\nAnother fave is the P-wedge: a pita grilled like a waffle, slathered in cream cheese and topped with arugula, grilled tomatoes and capicola (I think you can choose other meats though, but why would you want to?!).\n\nJust go, it's delicious. Give them your money."
1,"I never write bad reviews but I feel I owe it to other potential customers to warn them about the terrible food. The first indication that the food would not be up to par is when they serve steak with 5 different sauces. I true filet does not need any condiments. They then served us COLD fries, we sent them back to be reserved, still luke warm. We also ordered the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms (which are my favorite) and they were chunky pieces of rubber! I don't know how you mess up mushrooms but they managed to do it. To sum it up the food is not a five star experience. We dropped $200 on dinner were I would have been happier with McDonalds. \n\nWith that said...yes the food was terrible but I must admit the service was impeccable! Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about food and wines, polite, and accommodating."
2,My sister was visiting so i decided to take her to Loopy Lornas for a change away from the cafe bars and we opted for the afternoon tea as nothing else on the menu really stood out. The afternoon tea was very nice but very expensive at \u00a314.95 per person and that was for standard tea \u00a316.95 for speciality tea. The service wasn't great they forgot to give us plates for the food and I seemed to have to repeat about 3 times to the waitress what our order was and tehn with that they brought my niece two hot chocolates rather than one! I have to agree with previous reviews that the cakes i have tasted in the past have seemed to be quite dry although the cupcakes are lovely and all the little sweet treats we had in the afternoon tea were nice.\n\nI have to also agree that when ever i'm in there does seem to be alot of tables with young children but i think the reason for that is that it is the largest cafe/tearoom in Bruntsfield/ Morningside and they do gear there menus to little kids that other cafes don't.
4,"I always go at least twice when I visit my folks in LV.  I stick to the pancakes (duh), but the omlettes aren't too bad either.  The dutch baby (which my mom always orders) does take 20 minutes, so if someone else orders it, you might be in for a bit of a wait."
1,"Came here awhile back and haven't gotten around to writing a review till now. I was NOT a fan. Moment i walked in I stood there for awhile feeling like an idiot cause no one greeted me or showed me where to sit. My boyfriend and I eventually just picked a spot and waited for a server to flag down. Eventually an older gentleman with an accent came up to us and gave us menus. I ordered a pitcher of white sangria. It wasn't bad but it wasn't very good either. To be honest, the food was completely un-memorable that I forgot everything we had ordered. I just remember being excited for the bacon wrapped dates because I love them over at Firefly. Well it was not like Firefly's dates. They were soggy and incredibly salty. The server also never came back again and when he eventually did come around to give us our check, it looked like he was in the middle of eating something. I quickly paid and got the hell out of there. I haven't been back since and I probably never will. If they fixed their customer service and cleaned up their dishes a bit, they could probably do well. I guess I'll never know."
3,"From the moment we walked in to the moment we left we all were satisfied. My son and I had the New York strips which were cooked perfect and very delicious. My wife had the salmon and it was unbelievable. My daughter said the chicken sandwich she had was the best she had ever had.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive without being interruptive and in your face. To top off the evening, the dessert was to die for.\n\nIf I had to find something wrong it was that when we arrived, the background music was too loud but as more and more people came in it leveled off.\n\nAll in all it was a great dining experience."
1,"One of the few places that delivers to my area. Average food, good sized portions, fast delivery. They do, however, scrimp on the vegetables in a combo meat/veggie dish, although I guess that's better than scrimping on the meat lol. \n\nLemon chicken: LOTS of chicken, decent lemon sauce\nShrimp fried rice: 4 big shrimp, mostly rice and a few veggies\n\n\nWill try again if I'm in the need for delivery."
4,"I'm giving this five stars for a few different reasons.   We did the turtle feeding experience and were very impressed. We were shown through the facility in the back area and it was very well kept.  Our guide was efficient in explaining the way everything worked and showing us the pumps, tanks, etc. We were able to talk with the aquarists about the different sea life and feeding habits. Watched them feed the sharks as well. Very informative experience. Everyone was super nice.  We even got three free pictures of ourselves feeding the turtles.   As for the aquarium it's self it was very neat. It is small and kind of expensive so look for coupons."
4,If god was to open the heavens and deliver us a fast food joint right  in the heart of the city then this place is it .. let me reiterate if your on yelp and your looking for a place to fill your gullet with the best tasting fast food ever then this place it is .. again 1 more time STOP SEARCHING AND EAT HERE.
4,"Like others have said, great staff here. Mary is normally at the front counter with a big smile on at lunch time. Keep people this nice working here and ill keep coming back. You can get decent fast food anywhere, but great service is another story. Great job guys!"
1,"This past December, my fianc\u00e9e and I stayed at Langdon Hall on the \""Gourmet Getaway\"" package. This included two nights' stay, two country breakfasts, two dinners (three-course and tasting menu), and a half-bottle of wine and cheese. Our main point of comparison for our experience was Manoir Hovey, another Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux estate where we enjoyed a comparable package last December.\n\nI'll begin with the best part of our stay: the service. Hospitality at Langdon Hall is second to none, and the staff were extremely accommodating from the moment we arrived. We were very impressed with the courtesy and warmth with which we were treated.\n\nThe estate itself is also a highlight of any trip to Langdon Hall. We spent hours exploring the grounds, which even at the beginning of winter were quite beautiful and well maintained. Unfortunately, they were working on an expansion while we were there, and the giant hole by the parking lot and accompanying smell of sewage didn't exactly enhance the atmosphere.\n\nAccommodations were somewhat mediocre, and I suspect this was my fault for selecting a room in the cloisters. The cloisters are the newer part of the estate, and the tradeoff for modern amenities is the quaint charm of the main house. Beyond this, the room had a bizarre layout (the fireplace was tucked away in the corner) and felt somehow sterile.\n\nOur three-course dinner the first night was acceptable, but failed to exceed expectations. My venison was perfectly cooked, but was unfortunately offset by the inedibly bitter braised winter greens. My fianc\u00e9e loved the foie gras and veal, but was disappointed with her dessert. (We noticed, curiously, that all of the dessert options were sorbets.)\n\nThe tasting menu the second night was excellent overall, highlighted by an outstanding truffle soup. We opted to do the wine pairings, and wished that we had simply bought a bottle. It was heavy on Canadian wines, and we weren't very impressed with any of them. For the $190 that we spent pairings, we expected much more. I wasn't particularly surprised, though, as the \""cheese plate\"" that waited for us when we arrived included about an ounce of cheese, and the half-bottle of wine was a cheap Canadian Riesling.\n\nOverall, I would rate our experience 2.5 stars. I'm somewhat value-minded, though, and was disappointed in the return we got from a nearly $2,000 stay. Langdon Hall seems to be designed for wealthy guests who don't mind spending a fortune to enhance their experience. For the rest of us, there are far better options elsewhere."
3,"Three words, Thai Yoga Massage. Wonderful experience. Staff was friendly and courteous and the locale itself is just lovely.  Four stars not five is because I was expecting a different sort of  Thai yoga massage. =p Nevertheless it was a fantastic experience."
0,"The service in this place is like freakin molasses, for real. \n\nWe were given a buzzer when we asked for a table for two, which was fine, it was a saturday night and we figured it was pretty packed. Waited around for about 10 minutes then got buzzed and seated. The place was totally NOT packed. There were probably 5 open tables and no one being seated. A few of the tables still had a bunch of trash on and i didn't see anyone going to clean it. \n\nOnce we were seated we took a look at the menu. We decided to just stick with water for our drinks since we were getting a sundae. We opted for the Jackpot Sundae at 14 bucks because it was a combo of chocolate (which my boyfriend likes) and strawberry (which I like). \n\nWaited waited waited. It literally took them 15 to 20 minutes to come to us and they never even took our drink orders yet. We were seriously on the verge of leaving. There was a table of 3 next to us that came in 10 minutes after we did and we could tell they were waiting too. We decided that if they took their orders first, we were just going to up and leave.Tthey didn't, so they got us to stay for a while longer, but they did take their order RIGHT AFTER ours. \n\nWe were never asked if we needed anything or how we were doing, the waitress never even refilled our waters. \n\nWe waited about 20 more minutes for the sundae. It was freakin' ridiculous! I have a feeling they must be like this all the time. We noticed 4 cups of french fries in the kitchen that was just sitting there for 10 minutes, I hope they don't just give that to people when it gets ordered. \n\nThe sundae finally came. Half melted. Of course, they brought out everyone else's order at the same time. Are they really that lazy? They just had to wait to finish everyone's order from different tables to bring it out at the same time instead of making a few trips? The sundae's were seriously dripping because they must've been sitting and melting for a while. \n\nThe only thing they managed to bring in a very speedy manner was the check, of course. She pretty much gave that to us right after she handed over the sundae. So annoying. I should've ordered a soda or something just so she'd have to take it back and change it. \n\nThe sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service. It sucks that they have such an awesome location and awesome theme, but the service just ruins it all. They should really be more selective with their staff, I honestly don't know what they were thinking. \n\nI am NOT coming back."
1,"This is a very busy place on Friday nights and they don't seem to be capable of making the proper adjustments to adequately serve large numbers of customers.\n\nThe service was generally slow and inattentive, though it did improve once they became aware of us.\n\nThere is also an unrealistic expectation that patrons will automatically know to seat themselves upon arrival.\n\nI have nothing good to say about their food.  Their carne asada burrito was bland, watery, and unappetizing.  \n\nTheir chile relleno made me gag.  It was by far the worst.  The chile itself was hard and difficult to chew and I had to spit out the seeds.  The taste was disgusting.  I pushed it aside immediately after choking down the first bite.  \n\nThe chicken enchiladas were extremely dry and tasteless.  \n\nI literally left half a plate full of food uneaten.  Our waitress kept asking if I needed a box, to which I repeatedly declined.\n\nTheir only saving grace is the chips and drinks.  My margarita was fine.  No complaints.\n\nIn sum, if you want to punish yourself and have a miserable experience, eat at this restaurant."
0,"Well, I randomly came across this Noodle shop as I was wondering around into the Caesar's Palace, which is like a rat maze that is designed to never let you out. I was told that Caesar's Palace has one of the big cocktail drinks that everyone seemed to be carrying around in the street and there I got stuck in search of the damn drink. I started to get hungry and came across a bright white restaurant with ridiculous gold fish tanks. I was told that they hand roll their noodles and make their dumplings, so I convinced our party to stop by for lunch. Oof. Big mistake! We ordered the Beijing noodles, seafood noodle soup, Shanghai dumplings, and kungpao shrimp. All of them were complete misses. I am not sure if it was just us, but we completely failed on all our dishes. It might have been just a coincidence, but I think not. I think this place just sucks. It is overpriced for such a noodle shop and I have been lured in by the damn fish tanks. Damn it! And for those reviewers who gave 5 stars, what the hell did you eat? And what have you eaten all your life? Dog food?"
2,"I want to give 2.5 stars but that's not an option so just imagine I did.  2.5 stars, here we go....\n\nWe went for a walk last night around our neighborhood and this place caught my eye because of the sign that said \""Well Wednesday\"" all well drinks $3!  Ok, in we went.  It was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  Whiskey and Coke for him and Whiskey Sour for me.  They came out quick, were decent sized but my Sour lacked a cherry which is a minor detail but I secretly really wanted one.\n\nWe decided to share the Fish and Chips cause we weren't super hungry, it was ok.  The fries were better than the fish I thought.  We got talked into dessert and chose the Bread and Butter pudding.  This is where 2 of the 2.5 stars come from.  It was AMAZING, warm with raisins some kind of heavenly sauce and whipped cream.  Yum.  One more drink was ordered and we got our bill.\n\nThey charged $2 extra for an extra plate because we shared the meal.  This makes me mad because they didn't state this beforehand.  If I didn't make it obvious we were sharing and just ate off the one plate would you have added the $2?  As my Dad would say because of that it's an OTOTO.  One time, one time only kind of place!"
1,"My wife and I were excited to try this place as the menu looked good and they offered an $80 groupon which helps \""offset\"" the tourist pricing of these types of places (we are Las Vegas residents).  The staff was nice and attentive, and if based solely on them this would be a solid 4 star review.  The food, however was very average at best and  very expensive for what it was.  We started with a $16 chop salad that was VERY SMALL and very average, especially for the price.  It never ceases to amaze me how some high end places skimp on stuff like this that costs them mere pennies (iceberg lettuce and a few other cheap ingredients) and would definitely add more value to an expensive meal without much more expense on their part.  The bread was very crappy and either stale or lightly toasted, not sure which one.  Any italian place, especially high end ones should really focus on having quality bread as this is an italian staple.  The entrees came out, my chicken picatta was OK flavorwise, but it was NOT a chicken breast (first time I have had that happen anywhere) but rather a thigh.  About 5 bites of chicken and that was it.  My wife's lobster ravioli was a much larger portion and was pretty good overall, the one bright spot in the meal (although still a $36 entree).  Three glasses of lower end wine and we were already well over $100 for a relatively small quantity of average food.  Honestly, the Olive Garden is much better than this place.  I know not to expect too much from places that are meant to squeeze tourists, but there are many, many better places to go on the Vegas strip that give you much more value when they charge these high prices."
0,"This was our 2nd time there. 1st time was not very good (burgers were overcooked and flatbread was dry like cardboard), but thought we would give them another try. This time was horrible. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes to get food to our table. Both the sliders and charr burger, ordered medium, we well done and too dry to eat. They offered to make new burgers, but since it took 30 minutes to get our food, there was not enough time to wait for them to make new food.\n\nThe table next to us also had overcooked burgers and were also upset.\n\nToo bad, we live close, but would rather make the drive to Delux."
0,"Picked this based on the two reviews. Its been 45 minutes since we saw our server. No appetizers yet. There are two servers and six tables. We have watched two orders go back to the chef, worried about our food. Food came, recommend burgers or sandwiches."
4,"I love this place!  I have been coming here for  18 months or more and is still one of my favoriate places for lunch.  The food is fresh and cooked to perfection.  I have tried all three chicken options but like the grilled the best.  My little girl loves the mac and cheese and french fries.  Service is always top notch.  Portion size is just right and for the price, a great value. Keep up the great work!"
3,"I'm rating Uncle Sam's on their cheesesteaks alone. Sadly, I'm one of those girls who loves her greasy, heart stopping food. Four stars for the cheesesteaks, hands down. \n\nTheir prices are extremely decent for the monstrosity of a sandwich they give you. Go for the cheesesteak with mushrooms, cheese, and pepperoncinis. Make it extra peppers. So good.  \n\nI've only taken out, never eaten in, but the place is always packed at night. I've had wings once or twice, and I have definitely had better. Stick with the cheesesteaks and you'll be alright."
1,"We were there around 10:30 on a Friday night, looking for some post-concert dinner. The bar part looked more hopping. The dining part was decidedly not. The food was at least cheap, thanks to their half price munchies menu after 10pm.  \n\nI tried the individual pizza. The cheese was rubbery, the toppings scant, and the crust resembled more of a quesadilla than a pizza. The sweet potato fries was the highlight of my meal."
0,"Decor/Ambience: It's quaint and we were hoping that we'd stumbled upon a cute little gem of a restaurant on the first day of our trip. Upon entering the restaurant it was odd as it took awhile for us finally to be acknowledged by anyone and then once we were actually seated we picked up on the odd vibe. As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no music and the overall feel of the dining space is awkward as all conversations can be heard. There were numerous moments where a noticeable silence took over and I felt I could hear the people next to me chewing (or maybe I was just that hungry)!\n\nService: AWFUL!!! Our waitress seemed very sweet, but it was obvious her attention was elsewhere. We were seated and it took a good 15 minutes for our order to be taken. It then took another 10 minutes for us to finally see a glass of water. We found ourselves deep in conversation and then realized another 20 minutes had gone by and our waitress was MIA and no appetizers were in sight. Although another waiter passed by our table a few times and even cleaned the nearby table no one seemed to notice or care that we were left totally abandoned.  We figured we'd give it another 5-10 minutes before we gave up, but could not even spot our waitress during that time. \n\nFood: While I see other reviews describe the food as \""disappointing\"" I cannot even comment on the bread because after waiting for nearly one hour we did not even see a simple bread basket! We finally reached the point where we just walked out and left since the waiters were all MIA and from what we could see from the one table that had food next to us, it did not look to be worth an hour wait. \n\nNeeds overall improvement!"
2,"M&Ms World, located on Las Vegas Blvd, has risen to the iconic status of a tourist destination. Frankly, this is just another candy store with great brand imaging to back it up.\n\nEverything is over the top and overdone at this place- reminded me of a mini version of Hersheys Chocolate Factory. The abundance of sugar everywhere can hit you in the face, enough to give you a toothache. \n\nThey have every conceivable flavor of M&M available in the store. One of the walls is lined with M&M dispensers, with self-serve bags nearby, and one can help oneself to every possible type of M&M - minis, green, blue, raspberry, chocolate, aqua and a ton of other flavors. \n\nThey also have several M&M keep-sakes- ranging from magnets to toys, clothes, magnets, canisters and mugs, just to name a few.\nFirst, second and fourth stories sell candy and products, while the third storey houses a theatre where one can watch a 3D M&M movie, which probably is the best part of a visit to this store. \n\nNo doubts as to which audience they are targeting. This haven of sugary madness  can end up being a parent's nightmare."
4,as i stated in my last review this place is fantastic from the valet parking to the host to the wait staff and the food that come s ou tof the kitchen oh and the ambience you will not be disapointed
2,"I gotta say, I do not see where the rave reviews for ATS come from. I get the niche vegan group but, aside from the chain being named best carne asada by a local paper, I find the restaurant underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad -- the place is clean, has its own style, and has found success with shops all around town now. But I find the menu limited, the prices high, and the food just okay.\n\nBut when out of towners visit looking for the Best Mexican food, I steer elsewhere."
1,It's okay I don't have anything to say really the customer service is ok and the food is okay only had one bad experience where all of my tacos were crushed couldn't eat them with out a spoon it was horrible.
2,"We had a hasty brunch here right before we made a mad dash for the airport because 5Church happened to be open and convenient.\n\nThe standout for me was the bottomless sangria, naturally.  It had me at \""bottomless\"" and me secretly wishing our flight had been booked for later in the day.  I ordered a mixed green salad and a roti potato cake - it resembled a thick cake of hash browns.  Both were decent and did the trick, but I was a bit sad that the current-at-that-time seasonal menu didn't advertise more veggie-friendly options.  From what I understood, everyone else's selections were fairly competent, although nothing was especially noteworthy.  \n\nThe service was quite prompt and attentive - you know I tried to inhale as many glasses of that delicious sangria as humanly possible.  Definitely a cute little spot and was great for our large party of 12 or so . . ."
4,"Absolutely great food with local ingredients and not too expensive for what it is. I would recommend the rice bowl, soups, pretzels, and especially the sandwiches because the bread is amazing. Absolutely great. Great little place with outdoor seating and funky indoor seating. Fantastic food, great joint."
3,"Yeah, a brand new buffet!  Suns here finally opened, after months of delays, & it's real good now that we have it.  Robyn N. & Mike C. joined me to give it a try today, & they were serving 136 food items, plus dressings & sauces, in this big, comfortable place featuring both booths & tables.  \n\nSome things besides the wide selection that impressed me today were the delicious Hot & Sour Soup, the tasty Bok Choy, a nice selection of just-made Sushi, & the wide selection of other seafood!  There was a great vegetarian tofu dish as well, with various veggies & mushrooms, all in a rich gravy.  Eight real ice cream choices go along with a good number of other desserts to make sure you leave full & happy!  Our table service was excellent too, & the staff members friendly.     :-))\n\nA high 4-Stars for Suns Buffet where Lunch Buffet is $8.39/$7.56 Sr."
2,"The chicken shwarma, kaftta and hommus deluxe are excellent. The garlic sauce is so good I want to drink it. Can you smell my breath from here?\nAwesome staff and a cool store in the back. Try the cookies and the baklava, they're delicious."
0,"We purchased round trip tickets to and from the airport .On the way back to airport, we called the night before to confirm our ride at 12pm. We were at the pick up spot 30 minutes early.  We called 11:50am to make sure that the shuttle would come on time. We were told yes. But no, 12:10pm we called again, again were told the shuttle was coming but needed to give the driver 15 minites window.  We did. We called again at 12:15pm, and were put on hold. And later told us, the driver's on his way. 12:30 we called again, they had the nerve to tell us that nobody is coming. They said the driver's GPs showed that the bus was there and WE were not there to get picked up. We were at the designated \""tour lobby \"" for the entire hour! In the cold! How could you say that we were not there?! We would never use that service again! And they would not refund our money!"
2,"This is a pretty cool place in the heart of Bloomfield. I've never eaten at the restaurant, but I've frequented the bar and it's always been serviceable. The bar in the front is very open with four sides and a bunch of TV's for game-watching. There's always some cute girl behind the bar looking to catch tips from young or old single guys from the neighborhood. Had some food at the bar once that was alright. Good for a stop-in at some point."
2,"I not sure what to make of this place - Kampong Ah Lee is a very traditional Malasian take aways and diner which serves big portions of what I can only assume are traditional Malasian dishes - they are very tasty and more than something different if you seem to always be eating Chinese take away and need something different, I cant remember the name of what I had to eat, but it was full of prawns and possibly even chicken and had lots of noodels cooked into it and spices. Yum!\n\nThe trouble is though that even with the big portions of good food, the price of this place is expensive. Also, staff are a bit on the grumpy side, but that is just a minor annoyance."
3,"I'd like to become a regular here. Especially at the bar. It's well stocked with good liquors and a big selection of Belgian and Belgian-style beers. The bartenders are friendly. The atmosphere is dark and rustic/charming. The patio is intimate with a nice fireplace and heaters with large comfy couches. The food is great, though it takes quite a long time for it to come out after you order it. My boyfriend and I had the burger- moist, perfectly cooked, and with great flavor. We also split the challah french toast. It was very good as well. This place is exactly what I'd like in a neighborhood bar."
4,"Have always gotten the Italian hoagie but never actually stepped inside the restaurant.  Our NYC friend was visiting town and he wanted to see the Mattress Factory.  So we were both hungry and Peppi's was on the way and the atmosphere was awesome and fun.  While waiting for our food, an employee there also recommended us to check out RandyLand, which is also down the street.  Great Food and Great people!  Thanks Guys!"
3,"Went here for sushi for a change of pace (we usually go to Kan Pai).  It's a little far for me, but the sushi was good.  They had a late night happy hour that was 20% off everything after 9pm, I believe.  If it was closer, I'd probably be a regular."
2,"Des biscuits ET des bonbons \u00e0 ne plus finir. Ce magasin pourrait vous mettre dans un coma de sucre juste \u00e0 regarder tout ce qu'il y a! Mais ne vous inqui\u00e9tez pas trop parce qu'on y vend aussi des noix (sant\u00e9, non?) et des bonbons sans sucre. C'est un magasin super color\u00e9 et rempli de bons bonbons. Pour ce qui est des biscuits, \u00e7a avait plut\u00f4t l'air d'\u00eatre des biscuits classiques que l'on retrouve dans des bo\u00eetes \u00e0 l'\u00e9picerie. Parfait quand on a une envie sp\u00e9cifique (whippet ou biscuits \u00e0 l'\u00e9rable pour moi) parce qu'ils sont disponibles \u00e0 l'unit\u00e9 donc on peut facilement y passer s'en prendre quelques-uns au lieu de se sentir coupable de manger toute une bo\u00eete de biscuits... soi-m\u00eame... en une soir\u00e9e... au lieu de souper! Par contre, plus je vieillis, moins j'aime la bouffe pr\u00e9-faite et je r\u00e9alise que mes go\u00fbts pour les biscuits sont vraiment en faveurs de ce qui est fait maison. La biscuiterie Oscar est donc simplement pas mon genre quand \u00e7a vient aux biscuits, mais je la trouve quand m\u00eame charmante et les bonbons me soupirent \u00e0 l'oreille de les acheter donc j'aime quand m\u00eame!"
4,"I'm a tourist in Scottsdale and I love Pinnacle Peak Patio Steakhouse.\n\nI felt like a real cowgirl eatin' meat after a long day of doing cowgirl activities on set with the Bonanza cast. I miss Little Joe. He was a cutie.\n\nIt's still warm out so we sat in the backyard with live entertainment from a real cowboy singing cowboy tunes plus some Tom Petty and Elvis.\n\nThe food is basic but the meat is well done. I asked for a medium rare filet mignon and that's exactly what I got. Plus I got a potato, mini corn on the cob, salad, cowboy beans, and wheat bread. \n\nI'm still full four hours after dinner."
3,"We also had the white pizza with garlic and a pizza with half sausage and the other half basil and tomato.  Both were outstanding.  Overall this place has good food, service and atmosphere.  This place is good place to relax and enjoy. Get there early otherwise it's a wait"
2,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to review Moira. I was there on their opening night a few years ago and while we were all super excited for a more upscale Asian place (and the first sushi place in the downtown area, for that matter), the restaurant had a lot of kinks to work out with delivery of food (particularly getting sushi before hot items) and just service in general. However, we were all pretty happy with the food. While the sushi wasn't the freshest we've had in Arizona, the rolls were well executed and the hot food was enjoyable. We particularly liked the red miso soup with tofu.  \n\nFast forward a few years and Moira has definitely worked out the service kinks. In fact, when my husband and I were there last Saturday night, we had some of the best service we've had in a long time. Our server, Heather C, was really attentive, with prompt drink refills and quick delivery of everything we asked for. The order of the food was all perfect as well, with the items we requested all coming out in the right order. \n\nI still don't think Moira's food is the best around, and I definitely have to give nearby Sens first prize for hot Asian entrees downtown, but it's solid and goes up a notch during HH, when much of it is half priced. I also give the nod to Sens for cocktails, as theirs are sweet/exotic while still packing a punch. I can't say the same for Moira's, which are all sugary sweet. I'd go for wine or beer (or a mixed drink, which was generous for the price) instead."
3,"What better way to celebrate my 29th birthday than to try to live it up like I was turning 21? There are many reasons why I don't frequent these \""ultra high-end\"" nightclubs anymore, but I guess it was my lucky day. This was the first time I was on a guestlist with comp tickets and actually got in for free. No cover for a guy in Vegas? Unheard of. There was also no wait in the guestlist line. Dada Life was the headliner. \n\nPros: Aesthetics-wise, this nightclub is just as nice as any other. There's a nice lounge with benches for sitting without having to get bottle service. There's three different levels and plenty of space, except the main stage. \n\nCons: Stairs - apparently these are death for the ladies. There's no outdoor patio/pool area so it can get stuffy, but there's cool jets that blast the crowd every once in a while. Confetti is dropped every now and then, but the pieces stain your skin, especially the blue ones! The cost of a drink is ridiculous - a Red Bull/vodka was $25. So much cigarette and cigar smoke in an indoor setting.\n\nMark Eteson was the opener for Dada Life and was the only person I saw since apparently I'm old now and I can't make it to 2 am anymore. Still, I can say I had fun on my birthday at a Vegas club!"
4,"I've been going to Lori for my brows for almost 2 years! What a miracle worker she is. I will never let anyone else near my eyebrows. I've been to Sean for my hair twice and was very please with the results. Plus, he's a blast! I highly recommend Raw Image for all of your beauty needs!"
1,"I love the food and coffee here (although I would double dog dare anyone to actually commute anywhere while trying to eat the commuter breakfast sandwich). Long lines? I can deal with those. But for food/coffee this expensive why... WHY are there tip jars out? Please explain to me why I need to tip... for someone to call out my name? Really? Are you not paying your employees enough? It's ridiculous. I hate tip jars. But the service is always good so I feel like a jerk for not tipping, which results in fewer visits here. Seriously, your price+tip=way too much for what you get.\n\nAlso, what's up with the disappearance of the small yogurt granola? It's not on the menu and missing from the refrigerated case the last couple of times I've been in there. Boo."
4,"Totally amazing a great bargain the massage therapist was wonderful, The best facial I have ever had, customer service was excellent, the atmosphere was very relaxing. frankly I will never go anywhere else. there was no negativity at all completely amazing I already want to book my next appointment, I also want to buy a Groupon for my boyfriend. Candy is amazing truly a skilled masseuse request her you won't be sorry!"
2,We found Bronze Cafe in one of the gay magazines in Las Vegas and wanted to be supportive.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. He was very patient will I was trying to make my selection. I settled on a curried quinoa salad and while it was flavorful it was dry as dust. Just a suggestion: this one would be excellent if it was a little moist and easy to swallow.\n\nThe Bronze Cafe is nestled in the center of the LGBTQ center here and I'm always wiling to offer my support. It just wasn't the stellar experience I was expecting. I'm just very happy to know that Nevada is more blue than red and we can probably thank Las Vegas for that.
0,big platters of tasteless food.
1,Very loud noisey place due to the hard floor and walls. Workers dragging charts and tables around while I was trying to eat. Very discourteous to patrons. I won't be back.
0,"I'm sorry, but this is the worst tropical smoothie ever. It looks like a teen hangout spot. I kid you not, there was like 30 employees & I'm sure they were all under 20. They were all just standing around talking to eachother. Half of them were sitting at tables! I've been here a couple times before, buts it's never bothered me as much. I was standing there for at least 10 minutes waiting for somebody to help me out. Horrible! I'm sorry. They need to either close this one down or hire new employees."
1,"Watch out!  This place has undergone a SERIOUS change.  \n\nI decided to have a nice steak dinner.  I wanted something slightly upscale but local.  Of course I jumped on Yelp and went searching.  A friend had mentioned Onyx before so I looked it up.   Good reviews... and a special coupon to purchase.  $30 off for $15 seemed like a great deal so I bought it right here on Yelp and off I went to Onyx.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place seemed TOO quiet.  We parked right up front, across form the door, and in the shade.  We walked and turned away from the bar into the upscale Onyx.  YIKES!  Gone are the tablecloths, waiters, and customers.  We are greeted by the bartender who cautions us that they have a new menu.  I ask, is this still Onyx?  He replies that it is but cautions me that the menu is much smaller and I might have trouble spending the $30 on my coupon.  Uh oh.  I thought about leaving, but I am already $15 invested into this meal.  \n\nNo more steaks or even entrees.  The menu consists of appetizers, pizza's, and sandwiches.  We order the crispy taco appetizer and onion soup to start.  The tacos were good... they should be as it took them 20 minutes to make.  The onion soup never came at all.  Then onto the main course.  We both order pizza's.  After a good 30 minutes....  THIRTY MINUTES....   the food arrives.  A word of warning...  if you order pizza here you better like parmigiana.  The pizza was LOADED with it.  It was really 90% of the taste.  The crust and sauce were OK... but they were overpowered.  Even if you love parmigiana, you are likely to be disappointed in the pizza.  They couldn't sell this in NY for a nickel.  \n\nOverall the food was disappointing and the atmosphere depressing.  No more live music.  No more tablecloths.  No more restaurant... really.  I guess they couldn't make it as a real restaurant and now are some sort of  cheap poker bar menu... but without the poker bar (unless you go to the other room... bogeys).  Honestly, I don't know why the owner just doesn't make one big poker bar.  The Onyx is dead folks.  Move along...  nothing to see here."
3,"Another Korean joint, if you're into this type of scene.  The Duk Bok Gi is great here.  The Korean chicken wings aren't as much.  I do like the kimchi tofu though.  The atmosphere is dark as always.  Music playing.  It has a slick decor with music playing a bit loud in the background.  Drink prices are fair I guess.  Food's a bit more than other Korean places.  Karaoke rooms are nice.  There's one that I know of in Z2 and a few in Zizzy which are across from each other."
1,this restaurant has great food.. tacos are amazing. but the one thing that i keep coming back for is the corn on the cob (mexican street style). its so amazing. you cant go wrong with anythibg on the menu.. \n\nthere is one small complaint i do have though. yesterday i had gone there to pick up lunch for my office. all the food was set up and i had paid for everything. the lady who had rang me up.. first asked if i wanted a bag for my large order. she then told me to wait a munute while she had to put ice in the ice machine and i understand that maybe that had beem something that needed to get filled.. but couldnt she have had asked someone else from the back to do it for her?  instead it took her an additional 10 mins before i got my actual order packed. i had asked her and the other guys in the back for my order. but i wasnt awknowledged. i then asked for the manager and she said she was... this kind of service is unacceptable. she didnt say sorry for the long wait or anything. needless to say.. if this one particular employee is working.. i will not be eating there and im gonna be telling everyone i know about it.\n\nother than this bad experience ... food is great nd service is ok.
1,"I had raw fish on the veggie with rice. It was above average but it is definitely over price. With $17 per portion, there was not a lot of raw fish in there. The waiter and waitress are very slow and complained about their tips. It took them about 10 to 15 mins to get us our check. I didn't feel like giving them a good tip either. \n\nI always want to try the place but we went into there on one of the Sats when they had lunch sign out. After we went in, they said that they don't have the lunch special. \nI feel like being cheated. Will not be back."
0,super small selection.  really.  go to Mandalay Bay instead.
1,"Mediocre food. 50$ for one person. I could have had better food at Panda Express. The orange peel chicken was cold and lacking flavor. The veggies in the dish tasted like they weren't washed before being cooked. Only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, it is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star."
3,"If you want to do your bit for your neighbourhood, forget about Blockbuster and other such DVD chains. Vogue Video may be small, but it's mighty. In a time of movie piracy and big chains I am surprised and relieved that this place has survived and thrived.\nMy friends and I usually  come here for our movie needs and it's up to date with what's out and popular, and the staff has always been friendly and quite chatty. Unlike their large competitor up the street they won't spent an age tapping away on the computer so you can get your movie. \n\nThe only thing I can hold against it is it's early closing time in winter. But the selection is great, at affordable prices as well. Be warned though it's not all in alphabetical order so don't be shy to ask if you can't find what you are after!"
3,"Good food, good service and I didn't have to wait long for food. Will be back next time I am in the neighborhood."
2,"Food: A bit overrated for a 1 star Michelin star restaurant. I ordered the green beans, Peking duck, mapo tofu, and steamed fish. For $100 the Peking duck was nothing out of the ordinary. Crispy skin generic. Sauce generic. Duck generic. The duck was supposed to be carved table side, but the waiter carved it halfway and told my table the rest would be done in the kitchen. The most memorable dish here was the green beans, which still had a nice bite to them and very flavorful. I was looking forward to getting a corn soup, but held back when I saw that an individual small bowl was $16.\n\nService: the waiters were very friendly, but were a bit slow with my table. I saw that the waiters gave other female customers a personal stool for their purses. My mother and I did not get that same treatment and had to place out purses on the floor. At the end of our meal we had waited at least 15 minutes for the waiter to charge our card for the meal. \n\nAmbience: The decor is all gold. The walls, the utensils,the chairs, and etc. A bit overwhelming to me as I like an atmosphere that is simple and laid back."
1,"I'm not going to complain because of the price ($400 for three people), but really, the quality, creativity and overall presentation is lacking. Vegas to me, should have restaurants of superior quality, where they may be overpriced, but you don't feel \""blah\"" after leaving.....Well, the one saving grace for me was the Tuna Pizza....but really, you give me anything with truffle and I'm a fan. The rolls were basic, the miso cod was so small....I mean, I knew we weren't going to get a big piece of fish, but what we got was VERY small!\nOur waiter was friendly enough, although he brought us the bill without removing the item we sent back.....was it on purpose?...Probly not, but when someone is spending $400, don't try and throw in extra stuff on the bill....\nThe hostess was a biatch! Yes, we showed up late for our reservation, but at 9pm telling someone that there would be no more tables for the rest of the night on the patio.....really? She just gave us attitude the entire time......\nVegas is a customer service mecca, or so it should be.....Yellowtail, I may be back for that pizza and cocktails...but that is it....Social has far better sushi!"
0,"I just had a late lunch. The all you can eat sushi was not worth it. The food was not fresh. It was horrible!!! I've been here quite a few times but I don't remember the food tasting like this. First of all, the edamame was not eatable. I couldn't even get the peas out of the pods. The chicken skewers were dried and had a weird smell with it. Perhaps the meat was sitting out too long?? The sushi items we ate didn't taste fresh. Especially the tuna. We also ordered the green mussels which was burnt and ruin the rest of my appetite. Overall for lunch I should of starve."
1,"So I'm throwing up an extra star because the place was inexpensive.  I mean, $21 for a sirloin steak?!  Count me in!\nUnfortunately my friends, count me back out.  I don't know what kind of meat they use, but this thing was tough and resembled rope.  Seriously, you're ESPN and you can't cook a good steak?  C'mon I know you're on the Strip, but you can't mail it in like this.  Service sucked as well.  I asked for A1, got a bottle with not much left (and trust me that steak needed it a lot!).  Steak was served but I had to ask for a fork to eat it.  The staff are second rate and are tired.  I guess if I couldn't get a job at one of the big money places in Vegas, I'd be a bit bitter as well.\nSave your money and go to prime rib buffet."
2,"I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.\n\nThe restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.\n\nI was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \""Chicago\"" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.\n\nLike other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.\n\nOur server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance."
1,"This restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness.  However, the food was really good and so I'd probably still go back.  My friend and I spent about $10 each for one of the family dinners...and let me tell you, it was an enormous amount of food!  It even included a whole lobster, which was really tasty.  You will see most of the seafood chillin in the tanks when you first walk in, so you know it's at least freshly killed.\n\nHowever, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.\n\nHonestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.  All the handwritten signs all over the walls advertising prices on fresh \""geo ducks\"" and shrimp, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, are just over-the-top carelessness."
1,"Met a friend for lunch at the Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.  Got there around 11:45, and we were the first there for lunch.  Ordered small spinach salad, which was very interesting w candied pecans, fresh spinach, feta, apples - very good, except the dressing tasted old. My friend ordered the gluten free pizza which was ok,nothing special, crust was chewy. Took over an hour to be served! Waiter was quite nice and kept apologizing - almost felt sorry for him.  Thought  the meal was only ok, and quite expensive."
1,"Not sure how this place has 4 stars.  I've had a salad,cheese steak and the pizza.  I recently relocated here from NY and have been trying the Italian places out around town.  I visited on 2 separate occasions and the second was simply due to a group decision.  Mehhh. . if you have too I guess, but if you're looking for good Italian seek else where."
2,"- Design, build out and atmosphere is really good \n- Hostess was very friendly and accommodating \n- Waiter was real pushy but attentive and accurate \n- Blue crab toast tastes like a good tuna sandwich, not blue crab \n- Octopus was a good presentation but just OK as a dish\n- Kale Salad was the best thing we ordered\n- Shrimp Po-boy was pretty legit and I'd get it again \n\nOverall, good but not excellent. I'd have a hard time recommending for the price point."
0,Way disappointed!  Food was garden variety mexican.  Our waitress was not interested.  And my biggest pet peeve of leaving the table full of dirty dishes while we were left sitting there trying to pay our bill topped off a forgetful evening in Scottsdale.  Go somewhere / anywhere else for a better expenditure of your time and money.
4,Small place....awesome spring rolls!
0,Do not go here! I just bought a brand-new car last week (4/9/13) and took it here to be washed and it came out with tons of scratches.  When I brought it to the managers attention he denyed the possibility of his car wash creating the scratches. He basically said That's what i get for having a black car... Also the vacuum job was lousy as well as the Windows.
3,"Went Christmas shopping here this week and it had everything I need. Conveniently had all the frames I was looking for, in stock, and was able to get photo albums, stockings, and santa hats all in one place. Being located in Tempe Marketplace helps too. I will definitely be back to this location. \n\nBeware that parking is somewhat had to find during the holidays."
3,"Good food, no parking problem. One of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas."
2,"I have mixed feelings about the AMC Arrowhead 14.  \n\nI will give it 5 stars for comfort and 1 star for convenience.\n\nWhen we arrived, the movie we were planning to see was sold out for the next 2 shows.  So, we decided on another movie, which was sold out for the next show and the one after only had front row seating.  We decided to buy tickets for the next available showing of the movie we came to see.  When purchasing the tickets, we found out that there are hardly any seats in each theater and that is why all of the shows were sold out.  So, we bought our tickets and passed time for a few hours by walking around the mall (maybe that is their business plan).\n\nWhen it finally came time to see the movie, we walked in and saw the gigantic chairs that were taking up all of the space in the small theater.  They were by far the most comfortable movie seats I have ever experienced in a theater!  Maybe too comfortable.  It is extremely easy to fall asleep in these large, plush, reclining seats.  If the movie is terrible, like the one we went to, it can be a huge bonus to be able to take a comfy nap during the movie.  However if it is a good movie, that might end up being a problem.\n\nI am not sure if they take reservations for the movies here, but if they do, I would highly recommend purchasing your tickets prior leaving for the theater.  It will save you a lot of time waiting around for the movie and you will still get to enjoy the huge comfy chairs!"
0,"This place needs to close.  Half the waitresses are tweekers with missing teeth.  Our server must have have been on meth, she messed up the entire order.  I talked to the manager, Javier, about the service, and he said \""what do you want me to do about it?\""  This Applebees has seen better days."
0,"made the huge mistake of leaving money in the car... realized it a few minutes after I gave them the car but too late, 15.00 cars wash cost me 55.00... my fault I guess hope the slime balls have fun w my $$ but hey I have more and they don't so I win... also half ass job and NEVER get your vehicle \""detailed here!"
3,Great sandwiches. And a ton of food.  Wasn't thrilled with their potato salad. Get fries instead.  Restaurant is kind of a kickback from old Vegas. Wait staff was friendly too.
1,Great open concept layout. excellent eating areas. The only problem I ran into was that it took about 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar. Hopefully this was just a one time occurance.
4,"My husband and I ate here on our way home from Vegas. I looked for an Indian restaurant on Yelp with good reviews and Yelp saved the day again by leading us to this wonderful gem. They have meat, vegetarian and vegan options. The buffet was huge and delicious. Everything is clearly labeled whether it's vegan or vegetarian, too, which was so helpful. I could only wish to find this wonderful of a vegan friendly Indian restaurant in L.A. I am on the hunt! I will be eating here everytime I visit Vegas!"
1,"Decided to give this place a try based on all of the great reviews. Upon entrance, very clean. Service was quick and the staff were friendly. The food: I ordered the family pack which consisted of 25 strips (baked/grilled), fries, veggie kabobs, and mac & cheese. The strips were just ok. Nothing special. Mac & cheese was bland but I loved the cheese topping. I loved the veggie kabobs and TX toast. Fries were just ok. Tried all of the different sauces and my fav was the BFG & Honey Mustard sauce. Overall, I probably would not come back."
3,Love the staff members! Especially Bartender's Tim and John!
4,"I love Community Florist!  I use them to get bimonthly flowers to decorate my salon and I also used them for my wedding.  They worked with my budget and I couldn't believe how many flower arrangements I got for what I spent. I was also able to make payments which really helped.  My bridal bouquet was absolutely stunning and matched my personality and accented my dress.  Their prices are amazing as well and they can work with any budget.  Over the last year I have purchased arrangements to celebrate birthdays, love, accidents and even death.  I can go in there and give them a bit of history of why I need an arrangement and tell them a bit about the person and they create the most perfectly beautiful personalized one.  You can also get amazing terrariums created here as well.  They also have classes on floral arranging.  Thank you Community Florist for bringing such wonderful flowers into my life!"
4,I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.  I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost.\n\nI'm very satisfied with my experience with them.
0,"I was excited to have El Hefe open on Mill since it's closer to my house than the Scottsdale location and I love their margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed with the service, I didn't expect it to be fantastic but thought it would at least be decent. \n\nI gave this place 2 tries, my first visit was the 2nd week it was open.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.  The bartender explained she didn't have the beer we wanted at this bar.  I guess she didn't want to go get the bottles from the other bar or stock her bar properly so she could be prepared for customers.  We ended up closing the tab and leaving.  \n\nThe scottsdale location has a side bar as well kinda in the back, and that bar always seems to be stocked to make all the margaritas and more from the menu.  That being said, I was kinda shocked with the laziness of this bartender, especially since we were 2 of the 4 people at the bar.  \n\nMy 2nd visit was Valentines day 2014.  My boyfriend and I went to get a drink at El Hefe before dinner since the basketball game was on.  We went to the main bar this time and waited in plane view for about 10-15 minutes to be asked for our order.  As I was standing there, I noticed the bartenders were not taking anyones order from the bar, they were mainly paying attention to the tickets coming in from the restaurant.  I found this weird, especially since people at the bar were trying to order drinks but couldn't get the attention from the bartenders.  I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.  They exchanged some words and he just continued making drinks for the tickets from the restaurant instead of even attempting to look for my bf's card.   \n\nWe ended up leaving and going home since we were getting no where with the El Hefe staff and didn't have card to pay for dinner.  (If I was aware this was going to happen I would have brought money so we could go to dinner, but I didn't plan for El Hefe's staff to be completely rude and incompetent of helping a customer).\n\nThe next morning my boyfriend calls El Hefe when they opened and asked if they had his card.  What do you know...they had his card and it was BEHIND THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you to the El Hefe staff for not even bothering to look for my boyfriends card on Valentine's day.  Thank you for ruining Valentine's Day night that was supposed to be fun and simple.  Instead it was shocking and put us in a bad mood because the El hefe staff refused to help with such a SIMPLE task. \n\nI don't think there will be a 3rd visit."
3,You have to be careful here and only order the Hawaiian food because they also offer Chinese food but they jacked up the price for that and you don't get as much as when you order Chinese food. I get the Loco Moco because it's huge and cheap
2,"[Note: This review applies to both the Mills Street and West side locations.  I've only had lunch and not dinner at these restaurants.]\n\nFood: Generally decent.  My only real complaint is that seasoning seems to vary every time I go; sometimes the entree tends toward the bland, and soup can be towards the salty side.  \n\nService: I've only had take-out, but they've always had the food prepared when they said they would.\n\nValue: Lunch special is quite a good deal (entree, soup or eggroll, rice for $6-7).  Haven't had dinner there.\n\nOverall: Guilty pleasure for this Asian.  Taste is closer to authentic than I expected, but I rather look at this restaurant as second-tier fast food (kind of like Qdoba vs Taco Bell)."
4,"Just ate here and it was seriously the best ramen I've ever had, definitely. And for a great price! Seriously, for a standard bowl of tonkatsu shoyu it was like $7. \n\nIt was very filling, might I add. \n\nBut, point is, the staff was incredibly kind, the service was incredibly speedy, like blow my mind speedy, and the food was impeccable. I will be coming back. 10/10"
2,"It seems like a frozen yogurt joint is on every block-- I have at least 5 within a 5 mile radius that seemed to replace all the passe trend  cupcake shops.\n\nYogels, however, is my household's go-to spot because of 2-for-1 coupon from their e-mail club.  Their yogurt flavors are pretty boring and unmemorable (but with a nice selection of toppings) but you seriously cannot beat paying $4.00 for yogurt for two people. The yogurt may be marginally better at Menchies or U-Swirl but, damn, $12.00 for two people? Um, no.  I'll take my Yogel's 2-for-1 and hope for improvements in the meantime."
3,"Let's fall into the Gap!\n\nEven though i grew out of this brand i still come here to buy gifts for my friend's kids. I also buy their perfumes and colognes for gifts. Their quality is pretty great I love their exceptional customer service. Everytime i fall into the GAP i always get greeted wtih a smile and promos are being said. Sales associates are always checking up on you every 10 minutes to make sure your finding things ok which get's a little bit annoying, but  i consider it an exceptional service.\n\nIf your stump on trying to find a gift for someone, fall into the gap and get them a sweatshirt. For a baby sweatshirt i bought recently it costs around $40. A bit pricey but still it's the GAP what do you expect, im sure the adult sweatshirts are a little bit more, but the material is worth it, not cheap at all.\n\nFall into the GAP now!"
2,"Huge portions. Great prices. Both big pluses that everyone in the area suddenly realizes at noon every work day. The place goes from pleasantly populated to crazy crowds clamoring for burritos. But alas, no burritos are forthcoming from the kitchen, just more harried waiters.\n\nGo here of you want those pluses. But don't go at rush hour."
1,"Went here yesterday for lunch while my car was at MINI being serviced. The place for starters has no feeling of arrival. There is just a door on the side of a building with no awning, patio, etc. There was no one there to greet me when I came in so I made my way over to the bar. There were a couple of middle aged women running the bar and doing a mediocre job of it at best. I ordered the chimichilada, MAN, you gotta REALLY like mushrooms to eat that thing. The chimi part of it was ok, but nothing really to write home about. This place has been dubbed a direct competitor to Richardson's? get real. The chips were the only good part of my meal. I'm a big guy with a big appetite, and I didn't even have a desire to finish my meal, it was just not a good dish. Besides the food, the restaurant was just really akward in layout. The bar top seemed as if it were a removable piece of furniture from Ikea... not cool. One of the waitresses even had her two kids hanging out in the restaurant running back into the kitchen, eating, etc. Pretty sure that would violate some sort of health code. I'll stick to Richardson's thank you.\n\nUPDATE 6/26/08:\n\nWent here to please my co-workers... they all wanted to go after taliesin west tour so I figured I would give it another shot. Worse than the first time... the service was worse, the chips and salsa was worse, and the food was even more bland. Not as many mushrooms though. I'm gonna keep it at 2 stars though, because I hate to give out onesies."
1,"We have been eating around a little now that we are retired and have time to experience new places for lunch. We arrived just before noon and there was some activity and all the TVs pumping all sorts of yesterdays games or today's sport news.Being the grump I am I asked if one of the 30 or so TVs could be turned to CNBC business news as I like keeping up on my other game.It never happened. \nI asked what of three sandwiches would be best today, Philly, Reuben, or french dip. It was suggested that the Reuben. Only half good. The meat was bland as it was held in a water bath to keep warm and its texture was weak. The bread was so so and french fries average. I won't be back. Service was average but had like 4 different peeps at the table.which I don't\n care for. I like dealing with one server."
4,"The food here is amazing and consistent. Love the noodles, chicken and seafood. We stop here every time we are in town."
4,"This place has never disappointed me and has always impressed visitors. Great drinks, an awesome happy hour, superb decor and awesome music soundbites."
3,"MEXICAN? CHINESE? CHINEXICAN??! W-H-A-T? \n\nOk, now that I've figured that out I can say that this place was amazing. I've heard great things but honestly I never let comments affect my opinion before I eat somewhere.\n\nThere were a few meals that were definitely family sized including both the 20 vegetable fried rice(a must have) and the noodle/soup dishes. The tacos themselves are very different and each has its own unique taste/texture. Duck tongue taco? Yes please!\n\nThere was a problem with one of the dishes and it literally came out about 10-15 minutes after we were done eating so we no longer wanted it. Service was a bit poor and inattentive aside from the food mix-up but the food was so tasty that I barely wanted to take off a star."
3,"I think many people haven't heard the old \""you get what you pay for\"" quote. \n\nThis is the perfect place to stay at if you're going with a bunch of broke college students (who shouldn't be spending money in Vegas but that's besides the point!). It's in the middle of the strip (right in front of Caesar's) and it's not as bad as many people make it seem to be. \nRemember, you're in Vegas, you're not going to be in your hotel room for much of the trip! \n\nI've stayed at the Mirage and the Venetian and they were a lot nicer than Imperial Palace but it seemed like a waste since we didn't spend that much time in the room. 35 a night (thu/fri) for a place to pre-game and to crash out is perfect! \n\nIt is what it is, a cheap hotel that's in a great location. People in here must be disappointed that their cheap Kia doesn't perform like a Ferrari."
4,"With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown Vegas, it's with much excitement that we ventured our way to it's newest arrival, Eat.\n\nFrom what I gathered, Eat is a casual venue, similar to a diner, but with a hipper atmosphere and a focus on quality-driven, locally sourced comfort food.  We have been waiting for this kind of establishment for a long time; Vegas definitely needs an urban identity with a sense of community away from commercial strip centers and suburban hubs.  Downtown is growing into it's own, shedding it's identity crisis of yesteryear.\n\nAs the surroundings are still a bit shaky, the actual building was in good solid condition and the parking around the corner gave a sense of safety and comfort (still faintly reminiscent of 'The Walking Dead' with Zombies eerily meandering the streets)....\n\nAnd as soon as you walk in, you feel a new presence has just emerged, a real sense of place.  We immediately fell in love-the interior is cool but not over-designed, an instantly inviting atmosphere that make you want to stay and enjoy what the kitchen has to offer. I had a terribly good feeling about Eat; and in my mind I was already coming back to eat...\n\nWe're gushing over the design and atmosphere, but in all truth; Vegas restaurants outside of the Strip have much to be desired in terms of decor.  Many have great food, but are so lacking in interiors that are actually humane, (not some graphic design nightmare or some catalogue cookie cutter interior), some don't even bother with any decorations-it's bereft of joy...\n\nWe were so excited that we decided to sit at the communal table (totally our last choice for seats in normal circumstances, but it was centrally located and we could see the entire room from that table). Loving every moment and excited for our Brunch!\n\nAnd we were in front of the open kitchen, so we could see all the action! Being that we came on a weekend, Eat was serving the Brunch menu which is our favorite meal of the day!  I was so excited, since I though we had missed breakfast and they had the most interesting items in the morning!\n\nWell, it was at the top of the menu and we couldn't resist ordering the Beignets dusted in Powder Sugar with a side of Jam and Vanilla Marscapone. It was a really great way to start off the meal and it was perfect with the Coffee!  BTW the table is set with Mugs and condiments in the center of the Communal table and Counter which is a great feature - kudos!\n\nI came in thinking I was gonna order one thing, but I ended up really cheating on my cheat day; The Chicken Fried Steak smothered in Country Gravy + Two Eggs Over Easy + Smashed Potatoes + possibly the best Rye Toast I've ever had!!\n\nI relished this dish, the chicken fried steak had the best crunchy texture that contrasted effortlessly  with the creamy/chunky gravy that was....really to die for.  It was a comforting country breakfast that I knew would last me all throughout the day and well into the evening.  The Eggs were cooked perfectly, Ioved scooping up the yolk with the thick cut pieces of Rye toast and the Potatoes sent me into overdrive...\n\nBy our waiter's suggestion, Rick order the Huevos Motulenos: Two Eggs Over Easy + Red and Green Chili Sauce + Black Beans + Green Peas + Feta Cheese +Sauteed Banana all on a Corn Tortilla.  WOW...the flavors bursted with vibrance, but the real game changer was the Sauteed Banana-it elevated this dish!! I had no idea that this one ingredient could really create a whole different flavor profile that made me fall head over heels in love! The sweetness toned the hot spicy Chiles and added a gentler texture.\n\nWe also ordered a side of the Chicken Apple Sausage which was extremely juicy and satisfying!  There wasn't one thing that we ordered that we wouldn't get again in a heartbeat-everything was amazing....\n\nAnd as any proud owner would, Chef Natalie came to each table and asked how the meal was, and we couldn't have been more happier with the food, the service and the ambience!  Eat is surely a destination restaurant and a definite must for anyone who has a love for comfort food and desire to patronize local businesses that work so hard to delivery great experiences!  We are devoted fans and will soon become regulars at Eat!!\n\n\nRatings (Out of FiveStars)\nFood:           5\nService:       5\nAmbience:   5\n\nPERFECT SCORE!!!"
4,"Well, it's ALMOST that time of year again. My favorite celebration... aside from Thanksgiving and Halloween. It's Matsuri. \n\nYeah, the parking rates around heritage square are pretty hefty when a big event like this rolls around. But it's totally worth it. I mean, when and where else in Arizona can you stuff yourself with steamed-right-in-front-of-you nikuman, take photos with samurai, see a kimono fashion show, feel really thankful you're out of high school and no longer as susceptible to the weirdness of cosplay, buy a hapi coat, pet a bunch of shiba-inu, marvel at bonsai trees that are older than your grandmother and watch almost 60 people wail on taiko drums? \n\nOK, I'm a little biased about the drums. But hey. We get quite a crowd, so other people must like it too. ;)"
0,"Just terrible, I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill, nope I got pan fried, flavorless garbage. The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa. Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces. I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else. Bad food, bad service, way to loud, why is there no negative star rating? This place gets negative two stars. If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility. Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining."
3,"The first thing to know about Kennedy's, is that this is not just some reincarnation of the old Ed's that used to be the name of this place.  Kennedy's is a whole different bar with a whole different flavor, both inside and out.\n\nNo review about this place is legit unless it mentions the phenomenal patio/deck area in front of the bar as you walk up the front steps.  The patio is full of fans, tables, umbrellas and even mist for when its really hot outside.  \n\nThe inside, bar area can def be a bit cramped, especially during peak drinking nights such as the 4th of July. \n\nBartenders are always friendly and on point.  \n\nI have never eaten here, so I can't say too much about the food.\n\nThere is def a younger, relaxed, New York meets Southern Charm, laid-back vibe to this place.\n\nKennedy's has a Western New York feel which I love.  If you don't know about a trash/garbage plate?  Well, then there's nothing left to do, but step up to the plate come to Kennedy's and learn how we get down in the Rochester, NY!  Roc Boys in the Building Tonight!"
4,Great and knowledgeable staff that are ALWAYS willing to help or just sit and chat for a bit. Amazing selection of everything from bags to guides and if they don't have it they will order it and get it to you ASAP. They have great prices and give discounts if you buy in bulk or military which is always nice to be appreciated! The number one thing that I love about DRS is that they open earlier than any other store and have EVERYTHING you would ever need or want!!!
0,"Room wouldn't heat up past about 60 degrees, which wouldn't be too bad if they gave you more than a sheet and paper thin blanket on the bed. Pretty much had to lean against the wall under the shower head to get wet with the little amount of water pressure. For $50 you get what you pay for. Also, shuttle was late twice so give yourself plenty of time to get to the airport."
0,Saturday hours 9am opening. Sat outside for 25minutes past 9am i was not alone there was about 10 other people. We all left because no body showed to open store! Second time I came to this location. First time had horrible customer service. Was yelled at for coming in the store a hour and half before closing. Will not recommend this place to anyone!  Ace hardware is the place i will be going until i find a better hardware location
4,I don't know what the other reviews are taking about. They were very kind and helpful to me. I was having major issues with my car and they walked me through the entire process of what needed to be done. The also quoted me for a new set of tires (I knew I needed them) and found me the lowest price for what I wanted. They were prompt and patient and deserve my 5 stars.
1,"We had a great team event (getting to know other team members) here but not much can be said abt the food. I had the ahi tuna with cold soba noodles, the soba wasn't bad but the tuna had some funky taste to it. The sauce did not go well and it was just undesirable. I left half of it behind. First time that I did not fish ahi tuna! We had a big group for dinner, abt 20 but the entire restaurant was empty but it took ages before we received the food. They were certainly not understaffed since there were at least 20 servers running around but no idea why. \n\nI'm sorry but two star is being generous; 1 for the great group camaderie and networking event we had and 2 for the somewhat nice interior decor."
0,You can't get anymore authentic than actually going to Mexico...San Diego was pretty close though. But now that I live in Las Vegas I can't seem to find a Mexican restaurant that can live up to Mexican authenticity. \n\nSo I did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito. Got the order paid about $9 with the extra $1 debit/credit card charge. Hmm.\n\nBrought the food to my hotel room...ate it. Disliked it. Too salty. Got mad. Threw half of it out. Still hungry. Went to Jack in the Box. Got an order of tacos and stuffed jalape\u00f1os. Called it a night. \n\nWould I go back?...No.
0,I moved here about a month ago and it has been the worst apartments I lived in two bad I sign a year lease. With in the first weak or so we started to see roaches n they fumigated then next weak we seen them again plus we started to get bit by bed bugs wich are not in our Matress but in the bathroom which of course were stuck with paying 150$ for the fumigation of them. They tell you the apartment is cable ready is not one aux cable wrks the cable guy said all the other ones look nice with there covers but some there in between the walls the cable is chopped so is not cable ready. My rent is 735$ but after allocated water service 44.88 allocated sewer service 25.07local sales tax14.80allocated trash service3.70monthly service charge5.03and new account fee10$ it adds up to my new rent been 838.48 big difference this apartments are not recommended take it from me I live here till my lease is up 11 more months
0,"Good food, but horrible, stuffy and pretentious atmosphere.  Showed up for late lunch & was greeted by a completely self-absorbed young girl who has clearly never received training in customer service.  The place was nearly empty and she asked (with a bored blank stare) if we had a reservation.  When we said no, she huffed and acted very put off.  Once we were seated, the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal.  Have dined here multiple times.  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy, \""wealthy grandmother\"" like atmosphere any longer."
3,"Feeling a bit unorganized?  This is the place to fix that.  I walked by the store thinking what kind of containers would require someone to open a whole store.  This place is much more than what the name suggests.  I was ready to redesign my closet,  bedroom,  and any other place in my house ending with the word room.  This place is great!"
3,"Very good, cheap Chinese food. Lots of specials including beer. \n\nThe only problem was that one of the servers had her two kids there who were making noise and literally crawling on the patrons' tables. If this is a regular occurrence, get the food to go."
4,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Madison Farmer's Market!\nYou cannot leave without trying Stella's Spicy Cheese bread. I may not be the person to ask about produce considering I typical go there to by dairy, meat, bakery products. A recent find we had this past weekend was Carmel Corn Gelato!  It is a fun place to wonder around and have breakfast. If you want to get in and get out without a lot of people it is best to go in the morning if you have kids, strollers, walkers go after 9 am when the pace is more a leisurely walk and you aren't getting in the way of the people who want to get what they need and leave. \nEnjoy!"
3,"This place seems very laid back and offers diamond ice (I haven't seen many other places that offer it here). My cousin searched for the nearest coffee place when we were out running errands and found the Street. I would not recommend coming here for coffee (very limited menu), but there are plenty of options for boba, smoothies, and diamond ice."
0,"Why oh why did I go to Chinatown in Montreal!? My instincts said stick to French restaurants and places in Old Montreal, but nooooo, I had to come here. \n\nFirst off, after we were seated, it took the waiter about 30 minutes just to come over and take our drink order. That alone should have been our cue to get up and leave.The place wasn't too busy, so that was no excuse for the terrible service. After taking our order, it took them over an hour to bring out our food (I really wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not). We watched as large groups of Chinese people were seated and served before our food came out; it was absolutely ridiculous how they treated us. When we finally did get our food, it was fairly bland and tasteless. I don't think I've ever been so angry in a restaurant (I usually have great experiences since I started relying on yelp reviews) and I want to warn every person that they should avoid this place at all costs; there are too many great places in Montreal for you to waste your time and money here."
2,"My flatmate's and I ate in Tony's Fish Bar once when walking back from our friends' flat one cold November night.  From the outside is appears to be your standard chippy but specialising in fish.  The man behind the counter (presumably Tony) was pleasant and seemed to value our custom.  What's more the the place was clean and the interior decoration gave it a welcoming atmosphere particularly after coming in from the cold outside.  \nThe menu consisted of the usual battered sausages, savaloys, haggis and, of course, fish and chips.  I had a battered sausage and chips whilst my flatmates had fish and chips.  Mine tasted pretty good and seemed to be up to the standards of any other chip shop.  My flatmates agreed claiming that the fish and chips were decent but nothing to write home about.\nTony's Fish Bar is an inviting chip shop with good service.  Although perhaps not worth going out of your way for, it's definitely worthy of your custom if you're feeling peckish on the long walk up Ratcliffe Terrace!"
4,"I took the lady here for our 1yr anniversary after hearing good things about it. She actually wanted to go to the Melting Pot since that was where we had our first date at - but hey, I'm the man here right? And I say that we are trying something new!\n\nEntering the door and going through the kitchen is different... and weird. If I hadn't read about it here on Yelp then I would have thought I walked in the wrong door. The girlfriend still swore I was lying and I pulled a fast one on her. Even after seeing people come and go through the kitchen, she was still skeptical! LOL. It is a nice touch though - my comment was \""it makes it a bit harder to spit in your food with customers walking through all the time, huh?\""\n\nI know, the way I think is weird.\n\nThe garlic bread was good. I generally don't like a bunch of \""crap\"" on my bread but I actually really enjoyed this bread. I could have made a whole meal out of it (I've heard that from others).\n\nThe taters were good as was the steak. The searing+flavoring was phenomenal on both her Filet Mignon and my New York. It was probably one of the better flavorings I've had on a steak to be honest.\n\nI actually undervalued the bill too. I figured I'd be hit with a Delmonico's (Vegas) tab but it wasn't so bad. Service was good too - I drink a lot and my water glass was never empty. My alcoholic drink (Long Island) was also good as well as whatever fruity drink she had. Not too alcoholic, but still very tasty on both drinks."
3,"Only been there a few times and then got a card that comp'd me 3 nights in March and 3 nights in April.  Room definitely showed it's age, same and dark, like you would see in an old mystery, but clean.   \nI think I found my new hang out, love the gaming, the girls and location.  I will use my April comps and they have a new customer."
4,"Very upscale steakhouse!  The service 5 stars.  The scalloped potatoes with fresh jalapenos 5 stars.  The rib eye with bone in 5 stars. I'm taking heaven people! Oh, THE best warm butter cake.  You might die a little but definitely surface back.  \n\nPerfection."
3,"A friend of ours introduced us to Tin Tin last summer and we've been a few times (most recently yesterday). We were appropriately prepped about the long lines and have only been to Tin Tin on weekends for dinner right as it opens. And other than Rusan's I haven't been to any other buffets in Charlotte, so I don't have much to compare it to. \n\nThe selections are pretty standard Chinese buffet selections. Standard soups, fried rice, various chicken and beef dishes, and some seafood. We usually come here for the snow crab legs and the blue crabs, and the shrimp. Unfortunately they didn't have blue crabs yesterday, but the previous other times that we went, they had them and we liked them. The oysters were a bit disappointing yesterday, but in the past they've been alright. \n\nThe service is alright. Some servers were more attentive than others. Some would clear our plates a little earlier than they probably should have, but that's not a big deal to me. \n\nI did notice that their sushi is pretty good, and they have various steamed buns, peking duck, made to order noodle soups, and even have ventured into a couple more \""fusiony\"" dishes. I did get to sample a little of that, and they did not disappoint. \n\nOverall we're pretty satisfied with Tin Tin. Again, we're not big on buffets in general, but when we're in the mood for crab legs and shrimp this is our place. And it's great because the standard buffet selections look pretty good too. Variety is good. I'd recommend it here."
1,"We tried Momo Sushi for the first time tonight. The food was very good but the service was completely awful! We waited for ever for the food even though no one was there. Neither of the two waitresses had a clue as to what the are doing. We waited forever to get a check When we finally asked for a check (although it was clear we had been done fore some time), they still took another 10 minutes. We probably waited 20-25 minutes for a check so we could get out of there. We will not be back."
0,"horrible excuse for a restaurant. sandwkch was tasteless, chicken tenders served\ncold and hard, no ketchup (?), ditsy workers. do not waste your time."
0,"After a big night out, went out here at 4AM to grab a quick bite before heading home!\n\nService was fast! Like \""You-Just-Ordered-10-MINS-ago\"" fast but sh*t...\nFOOD WAS SERVED COLD!!!!\nand i meant, NOT EVEN WARM or ROOM TEMPERATURE at least?\n\nThe two quickest food you think they can prepare in a hurry,\negg drop soup and chow mein,\nwas probably a left over from the night before and\ndidn't even bother to heat it up for us! \n\nYUCK!!!!\n\nDo yourself a favor!!!\n\nGo somewhere else or just buy yourself a bowl of noodles from 7-11.\nDon't even think about going here!!\n\n\nLOVE LIVE THE \""PANDA\"". LOL"
1,"This is the place designed specifically for the young, hip crowd. Something which I am not. It is where the stockbroker who makes $500,000 per year takes his $450/hr escort.\n\nThe place is gorgeous with a pink neon bar, open stairwell, and hot waitresses. The food I had was far too salty to be edible."
0,"Tried for lunch... Friday, half empty and told me food would be 20 minutes after ordered.  20 minutes later... another 20 minutes for a half empty restraunt."
2,"The Post Office near here is always extremely busy so when you're in a hurry this store is a good option. \nI use the store quite frequently and the staff are friendly to me. However I do see a lot of impatience shown to other clients. They get upset if your phone rings at the counter. HELLO , this is Summerlin, many folk have phones PERMANENTLY attached to their ears. A guy today was dismissed very quickly when he asked if he could leave his USPS parcel there for pick up. \"" They only drop off here, they won't pick up\"" was the explanation. Every USPS carrier I've met will take your parcel, mail if asked, but hey what do I know?\nUPS seems to be a little more expensive for similar services to FedEx and certainly a lot more than USPS but you pay for convenience. If you have time and gas there are better options."
4,Yum! It was great customer service we received. This has got to be the only panda express with a giant logo! I already had panda express like a thousand times so it's nothing unique from my taste bud. (I used to work at panda) the food came out fresh and the place was really clean.
4,"This Indonesian food cart is AMAZING.  Not only one of my favorite food carts, but easily one of the top lunch options in the entire city in my opinion.  Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day!  It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall.\n\nI've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic!  They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.  I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio.\n-The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow.  A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. \n-Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu.  It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\n\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\n\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.  Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch.  Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu.  \n\nThe owner is super friendly,  clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free.  I am *racking* my brain and I cannot think of a single reason to not send ALL of you here.  Seriously, just go.  You won't regret it!"
1,Stayed at this place for a convention and  it was the cheapest place i could find so i stayed here.  As soon as i walked in the lobby i realized that this place hasn't received a decent overall since the 70s.  Walk into the elevator to find the yellow carpet halfway up the wall.  Walked into the room and it was decently sized.  Turned on the air conditioning and it sounded like a 747 was taking off.  Eventually had to sleep with the window open cause street sounds were way quieter then the sound of that ac.  Its at the very end of the strip the only thing farther was stratosphere.  Its convenient if your going to the convention center cause its only like 20mins walk from there.
4,"Ian Childs is great, we always have to wait a while before being seen, but the wait is worth it for someone who takes time with each patient and always answers all our questions. He actually listens to complaints before suggestions, never feel rushed either.  Most of the staff is really nice and remembers us."
3,"After an intense workout, I always get hungry. Zaba's is the perfect place to go after such workout. \n\nZaba's is located in the same lot as LVAC. It has the same concept as Chipotle and Cafe Rio but with much healthier options. They had brown rice before Chipotle started to offer it. They have whole wheat tortillas. They have fish and shrimp. They win. \n\nI always order a salad with chicken. The awesome thing about Zaba's salads are that all of them come with guacamole, free of charge. I keep out the cheese and sour cream (sad face) to avoid totally ruining my workout. They also have toppings that Chipotle or Cafe Rio do not: sweet potatoes, cabbage, different salad dressings. \n\nThe employees there are great. I walked in one time at 8:50 PM when they were about to close at 9 PM. I usually don't do this, but I was really hungry and wanted some Zabas. The employees were really nice about it. I still felt bad though...\n\nPortions aren't too small and they're not too big. I think they're just right. They have a good thing going on in prime location with yummy, fresh food!"
1,"staff was friendly and so was the crowd, but it was a special crowd.  If I'd been booking a hotel would have spend an extra 20-30 and stayed somewhere nicer.   This is a cheap hotel/extended stay and you get what you pay for."
4,One of the best healthy food store I go to. I live their deli sandwich there. Place is nice and neat.
2,"My husband was born and raised in Pittsburgh, so after seeing this place featured on the food network, I wanted to try it because I am not from the area.\n\nAs hubby silently rolled his eyes and urged me to rethink my decision while reluctantly  giving in to my wish to go to Primanti, we drove into a crowded parking lot.\n\nUpon entering this sports type bar, the  loud environment with TVs everywhere didn't bode well with me for such a great experience.. I only came for the food, not the noise. Certainly not a place for conversation, but it appears a place for the Pittsburgh fans to hang out. \n\n  I tried the pastrami sandwich done the Primanti way, with Cole slow and fries on the sandwich. Loaded with Cole slaw and fries (not enough pastrami but they do have a double meat version if you are interested) I found the sandwich to be good, not great.\nThe Cole slow was sweet, and the fries were just greasy and so so.\n\nHubby was kind enough to not say \""I told you so\"".\n\nWent for the experience, and won't be needing to do it again."
0,"Upon entering Mellow Mushroom the Hostess stand is about 20 - 30 feet away from the door.  Just recently I underwent foot surgery on both feet so I walk with a cane and have those special black shoes they give you until you recover.  The Hostess not only didn't greet me upon entering but proceeded to walk me back to the farthest part of the restaurant.  I stood my ground, pointed to my feet and cane and asked for a booth much closer to walk to.  Next came the waiter who dropped off menu's, no welcome to Mellow Mushroom my name is ----- how are you and what can I get you to drink.  Nothing, no personality at all and before he left I asked for a manager.  I got Andrew who knelt down so we could be face to face and I expressed my view points with the hostess and the waiter whose name I still don't know. He said he would talk to his staff about my concerns.  After we were re-sited I asked for the manager again.  Out came the general manager Blake, I again expressed my view points but he wanted a \""pissing\"" match with me instead.  He wanted to know how many restaurants I had opened, I said I've been in the Hospitality Industry since 1980. I also worked in the customer service department at American Express for many years.  I asked him why the employee's don't wear name tags,  Because it is \""Corporate Policy\"" not to wear name tags as express by the general manager Blake.  Well I like to see the person's name who is serving me.  I asked him why the employee's are allowed to show their tattoo's, again it is \""Corporate Policy\"", if you got them, show them.  Well I don't really want to see someone else's art serving me, although I have tattoo's when working professionally, you won't see them. I have traveled across the United States working and eating in some of the finest restaurants, but I've come to the conclusion Mellow Mushroom is run by some 40 year olds who really don't see the bigger picture.  They hire general manager's like Blake who I may add had been the rudest and most condescending restaurateur I've ever met and I've met a lot.  I guess I'll be getting my pizza someplace else."
2,"I'm giving this place 3.5 stars.  This was my third visit.  The first two were NOT good, but I bought a Groupon to try it once more and was pleasantly surprised on try number three.  I had the Lobstah Mac and Cheese.  The mac and cheese on it's own was nice and creamy with a lovely light panko bread crumb crust on the top.  There was just enough decent size lobster chunks to go around, nothing crazy, but not stingy either.  \n\nI am still bothered by the lack of clientele during my three visits even though they were all at peak lunch or dinner times.  When I arrived the counter guy was helping someone who was picking up an order and I stood there for several minutes before he acknowledged me and told me to sit anywhere (in the empty restaurant) and pointed to where the menus were and said I should grab one.  Another party of three people arrived while I was seated and the counter guy was STILL helping the pick-up person and did not acknowledge them either.  They finally seated themselves.  Service is not attentive for the fact that practically NO ONE was in there on all three of my visits.  \n\nI would like to go back for the Lobstah Mac and Cheese again and possibly to try the fried whole belly clams, but am hesitant for the service and the fact that my fiance had generic frozen fried shrimp on our last visit.  \""shrug\""  They REALLY need to step it up to compete in this town.  Lots of East Coasters are looking for authentic food and they would go through the roof if they hit it right."
0,"We stayed here this weekend. When we booked we let them know we had children. They assured us the pools would be perfect for them. Well, that could not be a bigger lie of they tried. The pool was so over packed with drunk people that the lazy river doesn't even move. One man even pushed my 8 year old under the most intense waterfall I have ever felt. Luckily my 25 year old saw her in time and pulled her out from being trapped in the current. When I told management, they said there was nothing they could do, that they have a routy crowd because of the concerts they host... So why did you originally tell me this is the perfect place for kids? Also, why does a child drowning not alert the sleeping lifeguard? Oh, and why is their response to my child drowning, \""I can comp you a couple drinks at the pool tomorrow?\"" Are you kidding? Why would I go back to pool where my child almost died? You should also know the Signature's team claims there are not a part of the MGM even though they are called The Signature at the MGM Grand. What a joke. Don't got here. Way over priced and not safe at all. \n\nAnother thing- you're only allowed to park 1 car at the hotel. They tell you if you have 2 to go park the other one at the MGM even though they claim not to be connect."
0,"Went in on a sunday afternoon. Place was dead. Wasn't greeted, sat at a table and was not helped. Waited 10 minutes, still no service. Walked out and still heard nothing from staff. \n\nIf time and service are important to you stay away from Hob Nob."
1,"My meaty potato(brisket) was excellent. Service is slow and not good. Drinks are soda, beer and  black tea. Not having one hydrating drink in AZ is ridiculous. GF's chicken was too salty, her kiddo loved the pulled pork potato. Air conditioning woefully inadequate!"
2,As everyone has said food is soso but the do have to pump it out fast to deal with the crowds. The show is cool mostly an older crowd it was for my grandmothers birthday. It's funny to watch people try to talk over the music looks like everyone is going in for a awkward kiss. Overall it's a ok place with the fam
1,"I'm sad right now. I wanted to like this place so badly. I wanted to have the positive experience others did and be able to happily write about it on yelp. Hubby and I went last weekend; got all dressed up, left the kids at home and took the date car. People watching was great, service was great, even our table location was great. The bar area was great. I loved the atmosphere. Did not mind it being dark at all because it was so cool inside. \nWhat was NOT great? Pretzel bread was a little stale but butter, lots of it, helped. The seafood tower was impressive, but the seafood adorning it was not so much. The Clear Lobster roll was outright INEDIBLE. Mushy, no flavor, disappointing.\nMy mambo salad was passable but nothing great.  When I asked for shrimp on top, after hearing so many great reviews about the shrimp, they gladly obliged. BUT when it came, they were overcooked and rubbery. WAH for me. Husband's steak was very good. He was gloating for sure. \nWe got two sides, the Crab Truffle Gnocchi and the peas. The gnocchi was decent but I really could only have a couple of bites due to the intense richness with nothing to offset it. The peas, while super fresh, were SWIMMING in oil. Seriously, they took great peas and drowned them to death in a sad, sad oil lake. \nThe butter cake was superb. Nothing but fond memories of that. \nSo, we spent a small fortune for a meal with one (for me) or two (for hubby) great points. \nI will not be going back. I will not be recommending. We live in Mesa, and were the first of our circle of influence to go and I am devastated to be the one steering people away due to such a lackluster first showing. \nI wonder what went wrong. So many other yelpers just love this place."
2,"I'm not a banh mi expert but I really enjoyed my roasted chicken sandwich and bubble tea. I think my tea cost more than my sandwich (cheap sandwich, not expensive tea). Good value for a quick and nutritious lunch. \n\nThe small seating area was clean but quite crowded. I think this will be a good spot to pick up a picnic on the way to the Jardin Botanique when the weather gets nicer."
2,"Not a bad place overall.  No cover, nice setup, and not too crowded.\n\nEyecandy sits right in the middle of the casino and can best be thought of as two different places occupying adjacent spaces.  In one space, there is a simple lounge with plenty of good seating and a decent bar, pretty regular stuff.  In the other space is what appears to be a mini-club, although it was among one of the oddest dance spaces I've seen in Vegas.  For one, I was told (though I didn't actually see this) that there are sound booths where you can plug in your iPod and send music directly to the DJ.  That's pretty much where the good stuff ends.  I am told that the crowd seriously varies, so we must not have come on a good night (but seriously, we came on a Friday night, so if not then, then when?).  There is apparently absolutely no dress code whatsoever, and that's really a shame, because as a result of this, there were plenty of guys in shorts and sandals (with the obligatory women stuffed into cocktail dresses two sizes too small).  I'm usually one for relaxing dress codes all across the board, but I think Eyecandy took it a bit far.\n\nAgain, I've heard that experiences vary drastically depending on what night you happen to be coming by and that there really is no way to predict what experience you're going to get because there's no discernible pattern at this place.  I can at least say with some certainty that the lounge area will likely remain consistent, and for this place, that's a good thing."
2,"The food was excellent here.\nThe reason why I am giving this place 3 stars was the service. It was really over the top.\n\nWe were not treated very well by one of the staff members. He seemed really annoyed with us. I am a music person from Nashville and was in for the Country Music Awards show and the Film Production conference with a bunch of folks from Hollywood. We are well used to $125 plate meals. This is a $36-$40 a plate restaurant and it did not carry Emeril's inviting, warm personality to it at all.  You never know who you are seating so you should always make your guests feel warm and welcomed. This place felt hostile.  The service was so over the top. The staff was dictating our meal service by taking our plates away before we were done and did not listen when we asked them not to take plates away. Our utensils were in the correct positioning to convey this message. The staff really work hard here, but it was like they felt they were under a microscope. We won't be going back there because of the staff.\n\nThe guy that took our orders and checked on our table seemed annoyed with us for ordering water as we were dehydrated from traveling. There were staff complaining about tips from other tables openly. \n\nImprove the personality of your staff and restaurant and perhaps we will go back some day."
1,Umm Arepas should be a couple of dollars at the most. A cheese Arepa is $5 bucks and add a plate of beans and rice and some Passionfruit juice we are now heading into the $12 territory. Lame..
1,"Would have loved to try this place. They were constantly closed on Sunday mornings, like at 9am...what bakery does that?!\n\""LUNCH SPECIAL\"" in their window...and they were closed.\nSo the wife and I gave up.\nNow its turning into a pizza shop (again), we'll see if they survive, this is the 3rd business it has been in 2 years"
4,"Cant say enough good things about this place.  I have been here twice and the food has been perfect every time.  the first time i had a new york strip which was amazing, but i was drunk when i had it so my taste could of been altered. The second time i was sober and it was confirmed that the food is awesome.  Get the filet mignon with merlot butter!!! It will melt in your mouth and maybe even tear up cause you have never tasted anything so good!  My fiance had the sea scallops which were good as well.  For an app we had the warmed goat cheese in a tomato sauce, nom nom!!!  Didnt expect anything less from a vegas restaurant.  Will definitely be back drunk or not ha."
1,"It was great the last few times...\n till I found a dried piece of spinach stuck on my fork when I unwrapped the silverware, and dishes had crumbs encrusted on them."
1,"I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\n\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  \n\nWhen the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  \n\nThe food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great."
0,"Avoid. I went to see this dentist about tmj. I paid $75 for consultation (which most dentist waive or apply toward treatment) for him to tell me he couldnt recommend any treatment until alignment issues where corrected with my chiropractor. He also sold me a temporary nite guard (the Aqualizer) for another $75. One which you can buy online for $25. One month later the night guard popped and i called in to the dentist to advise. The response was buy another or you should have come back sooner. Both the receptionist and the dentist preferred to lose a patient over an item that would have cost them peanuts to replace or rectify the situation somehow. The dentist actually insisted that i was paying more for his \""EXPERTISE\"" even though i paid his \""expertise\"" separately. Well he can keep it, along with his outdated office. A dentist should be more concerned about his patients than his pockets. Ill gladly take my dentistry needs elsewhere."
2,"I'd seen this place for awhile ago and had been wanting to try it. I didn't go, my friend picked up lunch, so this is just a review on the food. I had the filafel wrap. It was good but not great, especially for the price. The onions were a little excessive and I had a hard time distinguishing different flavors over that. I've had worse filafels but I've definitely had better, at least outside of vegas."
0,I don't know what all the hype is about.  \n\nI ordered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.  Holy bland!  I could have kicked myself for forking over $10 for it.\n\nOverrated!!
1,"So this is a mom and pop place in a not so great neighborhood.  We decided to give it a try since our favorite Korean place closed down and it is close to Nellis Base.  The name implies that they are known for fish and chips?  We didn't try it but maybe we should have.  The place is small ( only 5 tables).  Very amateur decor.  They were friendly enough.  They do make food as you order and only take cash.  We ordered fried wontons, egg rolls, spicy pork bulgogi, and mild beef bulgogi.  The wontons weren't Very flavorful.  The egg rolls were mushy and bland.  The bulgogi was just ok.  Barely.  We have been to Korea and this just wasn't good.  It was $40 for both of us.  A bit high for low quality.  We will continue our search for good Korean food."
1,me and a friend went there to Eat on feb 25 2014 and service was not so great. food was okay and  price of food was okay but I think its over priced for the portion of food they give you was way to little.
4,"I had a gold pendant with diamonds made by Alex - simple, unusual and beautifully unique. I love one of a kind pieces and this was superb. I recommend anyone living or visiting to come to his shop in Old Town Scottsdale. Simply exquisite!"
3,"I'm an out-of-towner, but when I'm in Squirrel Hill, I always make sure to stop here for a egg sandwich and a few bagels to go. The super cinnamon and the whole wheat are particularly lovely."
1,"Difficult to find.  Annoying bar setup with mostly garbage Bud/Miller/Coors products like Blue Moon, and they had the nerve to serve me a Guinness in a frosty glass.  Service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable though.  Old building on the outside but decent inside."
0,"My sister and I are pretty great guest at restaurants.  We tip very well because we want everyone to have a living wage and feel that waiting is hard labor.\n\nWe went to Carolina Ale House, sat down and waited...waited...and waited.  A young woman took our order but seemed annoyed at us for asking for food.  She didn't want to write it down and attempted to remember our order.  i figured it may have been a bad night but she was very attentive to other guest.\n\nThe appetizer was way too salty to eat so we sat it to the side.  No need to complain because we had meals coming and honestly we shouldn't have been eating so late at night.\n\nWe received the meals and a side was missing.  Another woman brought it to us and she was extremely pleasant.  We said thank you and she actually responded with your welcome.  Security was also pleasant.\n\nUnfortunately our meals were too salty to eat also so we bagged them to go but i don't know why.  We cant eat them.\n\nOverall:\nPros: TV's close to tables, location, clean bathrooms\n\nCons:\nUneatable salty food\nNo refills on sodas\nPoor customer service\nParking"
1,"Is RA Sushi owned by a white guy?\n\nFOOD: If your looking for authentic Asian flavor, you're on the wrong end of Spring Mountain. RA is a fancified, Americanized Japanese restaurant. And no, fancified is not a real word. Every time I come here, I'm surrounded by modern california rolls that look like Bobby Flay threw up on them. I usually order nigiri during happy hour. Fish quality isn't that great --just saying.\n\nRA \""CHIPS & SALSA: GOOD! Basically tuna tar tar and its surprisingly good.\nSPICY CHICKEN YAKISOBA: soggy udon noodles, not spicy\nEDAMAME: some days they're hot, some days they're cold\nNIGIRI: not the freshest, fish to rice ratio bites\nROLLS: lots of mayo, creamcheese, or some strange salsa thrown on it\n\nDRINKS: Full bar. Happy Hour specials for Sake & Beer (for sake bombs) is a good deal!\n\nSERVICE: BAD FOR GROUPS! The only time I'm here is for group functions. The servers are easily confused. They always run out of shot glasses for sake bombs. They forget to refill waters and drinks.\n\nSPLITTING CHECKS: For large groups, our server made a check for every 3-4 people. Not too difficult. However, for groups over 6 people, gratuity is automatically calculated 20% each check. This is WAY TOO MUCH for these incompetent servers.\n\nFood isn't bad. Its just not the type of Japanese I'm used to eating. Think 'real' Mexican food in comparison to Taco Bell. My non-asian friends like it here. My asian friends do not."
3,"I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.  \n\nThe ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok. \n\nThe place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.\n\nI went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning."
2,"Must say upon entering the building was a little confused...I thought this was an Irish Pub? Decor is sport bar/ rock and roll/ dive bar with nice wood bar and tables and chairs. Music was everything from country to Rap..no bagpipes...lol  Waitstaff wore what looked like they were supposed to be kilts (or kilt-like). They were super short with bras to match. Might as well been at Hooters. Menu definately was not Irish pub, they don't even have fish and chips...   But, I must say..service was prompt and attentive.\nI guess I spoke soon. I was still in the establishment while  writing this review. BF went to the mens restroom and he was totally disgusted. Said it smelled like a \""drive in bathroom\"" and was very dirty. Also...service got worse the longer we were there. With only 4 people left in the whole placed she never noticed I was out of a drink for almost 15 minutes. (I was even to the restroom and back)\n\"""
3,"For the price Le Village Buffet is a great place to eat when you're in Vegas. They lose points with me on the seafood presentation as well as the fruit displays.  Oddly enough (for Paris) the desserts needed a little help as well.\n\nThe seafood could have been tastier. The fruit did not look inviting and the dessert table looked too picked over.  However, you must try the custard ice cream - really good.\n\nThe red meat, pork, potatoes, Middle Eastern, Italian and Mexican table stations and presentations were all very good.\n\nTrust me on this one..."
2,"Open 24 hours and in the middle of the strip! I really didnt have high expectations for this place coming in at 3 am. The menu is expensive due to it being on the strip. I order bulgogi and beef brisket to share amongst friends. She first brought out sides, fish cake was not one of the sides for the day which just ruined my whole experience entirely... (lol/jk) But since we only ordered two types of meat it only came with two bowls of rice, so i had to pay extra. It wasn't served with lettuce or salad, it cost $5 more. This was the type of place that you just had to pay extra for anything extra. I guess I was expecting all you can eat type places that I'm more use to. Other than that, the meat portions was plentiful. \n\nThe server started off fairly rude to us and after a while she finally warmed up but it was already to late to leave a good tip :("
4,We frequent here often but I'd never taken the time to post a review. I cannot say a negative thing about Cyprus. The staff are amazing. They are prompt to serve us and the food is always fast and fresh. They have opened a new location in Chandler and we have been there quite a few times as well. I can honestly say they do everything right and it is consistent at both locations. \n\nGreek fries are a must and my husband loves the gyro pita and I love the chicken souvlaki pita.
4,"Great place, fabulous rooms, great view of the strip, right one soaking in a huge tub. Here for a company meeting."
2,"i shop here.\n\ni walk with my head down when i'm here bc looking up could mean 1 of 3 things:\n1. I will be asked for money\n2. a skeezy yucky man will hit on me and not take no for an answer\n3. i will step on the poopy diapers thrown around in the parking lot\n\n\nbut they let me bring my dogs in ( i don't grocery shop w dogs but when I look at other stuff) I wouldn't really say 'let' either, they just turn their heads and keep quiet. \n\nwhen I am in this area at night, which i try not to do, I need protection other than my safety whistle. my dogs may only weigh 4 pounds but people are afraid of them! \n\n im sure the employees don't care bc my dogs are cleaner than most of the shoppers anyway. \n\nalso, is it just me or does this walmart have the faint smell of meth? I can't say that I have ever really smelt meth, but I have smelt people who look like they're on meth and this wal-mart has a similar scent, no?"
3,Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected.
1,"I decided to try this place out because of the good reviews people have given this place on Yelp.  People talked about how great the food was and how fair the price was for all-you-can-eat sushi; however, my experience with this place was thoroughly disappointing.  I gave this place a 2nd star as a benefit of the doubt.. perhaps I just happened to have picked a bad day to eat at this place.\n\nFirst, the service was HORRIBLE.  We asked for a table for 3, and instead of simply pulling an extra chair up two a 2-seated table, the waitress sat us at a table for 6, only to have a party of 8 walk in the door a minute after I had started on my soup, so she asked us to move to a different table so they could have our table.  This wouldn't have been so bad if it was the only problem we ran into for the night.\n\nNext, because the staff was in such a rush to move us, they took my salad away before I was actually finished with it.  Not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience.\n\nThird, when we put in our sushi order, the waitress had to clarify whether we were ordering nigiri per order (2 pieces) or per piece.  We specified that we wanted 2 pieces for every number we indicated on the sushi sheet.  She nodded and brought our order to the chef.  The first half of our order came out fine. We got the number of pieces we asked for, but when the 2nd half of our order came out, the sushi chef decided to interpret our orders as \""per piece\"" so we only received one piece of every sushi ordered on the bottom half of the order sheet.  I guess it's no big deal, since we could always order more, but it took us a good 45 minutes just to get all of this order, we didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait to order everything again.  \n\nThe staff was also bad with keeping up with who they had already served soup & salad to and who they have not served yet (I happened to receive mine, but the person who showed up later in our group got nothing), and they were slow at refilling drinks too.  It might be because they got busy after the 1st hour we were there, but we wouldn't have dined for 2.5 hours if their service wasn't as slow.  \n\nAlso, the three sushi chefs who were working all disappeared at the same time, and were gone for about 5 minutes.  What kind of restaurant leaves the sushi bar completely unattended during the peak dinner hour?!?!?!\n\nAside from the service, the food selection was not great as it did not really include any appetizers, had limited all-you-can-eat sushi selection, and did not include any dessert.  We could've driven another 2 minutes down the block to another sushi restaurant that could've provided all the above mentioned items with same quality or even better quality fish than Sushi Kee for the same all-you-can-eat price of $20 per person.  \n\nAs for food quality, it was pretty decent.  It is among some of the freshest quality fish I've had in sushi restaurants, but there are definitely plenty of other places that could provide better quality fish as well.  The quality of Sushi Kee's fish is not enough to bring be back here again.\n\nIn summary, I would not go back to eat here knowing that Mido Sushi's only a block away.  I also would not recommend any of my friends to eat here either.  While the food quality was ok, the service and poor food selection definitely ruined the experience for me.  Had the service been better, I wouldn't mind recommending people to this place, but in all honesty, Mido Sushi truly can provide more options, better quality fish, and better service for the same exact price, so why waste time in trying this place out?"
1,"Glad I came here with a Groupon because I was not impressed. Definitely not a place to pay full price at. Small portions, big price, mediocre food. Enough said.\n\nOh, also, worlds slowest service. I don't recommend this place."
0,"Went to get my dog's food at the Pet Food Depot (Cave Creek/Grovers) and I saw a bunny in a cage on the floor, scared. He/she had food and a carrot but no water. I told an employee and after a bunch of \""that's not my rabbit\"" comments, finally someone gave the bunny water. The sweet young man who checked me out told the manager that a customer wanted to buy 2 parakeets. The manager said to put them in a paper bag because they're out of boxes...really, a paper bag? The young man said the customer specifically wanted the birds in a box and the manager said \""we don't have any boxes, should I grab one from the sky\"" and walked off. What a huge turn-off! I found out that the manager is the owner's son. \nI have been coming here for 8 years and this was my last trip here. There is a store a little further away (Western Ranchman at 32nd St/Paradise) that sells the same specialty dog food I buy, so they will be getting my business from now on. I have always been treated well here but after the flippant comments from the staff in front of a loyal customer, they obviously do not care about me or the animals they sell."
1,The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.
0,"Contact Groupon, they may be able to refund your money since you were unhappy. They stated it's part of their policy!!"
2,"Hob Nobs is completely unrecognizable from the old Willo House... and you know what?  That's ok.  Let's be honest.  The Willo House coffee really wasn't very good, and the service was pretty lacking.  So I'm over it.\n\nOn to Hob Nob... it's a really lovely remodel, if a little slick and glossy.  I thought the coffee was very good.  I haven't been able to eat there yet, but the menu looks great, if a little pricey.  Pastry selection seemed a little small too, especially as coffee shop= guilt free decadent eating in my mind, so I want some outrageous and fatty desserts to choose from.\n\nLocal artwork on the walls, with some pieces that I really loved.  The tables each have a different SUPER cool picture of Phoenix.  Very nice service, and I believe they said they'd be offering 2 hours of free wi-fi if you are a paying customer.  \n\nI've been twice now, and I liked it ok... I just didn't LOVE it.  It took me forever to write this review, as I don't have anything bad to say about it at ALL, but for whatever reason, I just can't bring myself to rave about it.   It's not especially homey, somehow, even as nice as it looks.  I'll have no problem going back next time someone says \""hey let's go to Hob Nob's\"", but it's just not my first pick.  \n\nHere's hoping that they DO find the perfect crowd that does love them though, and I really hope they succeed."
1,"Not able to drive anywhere, I tried this place which delivered to me on time about 45 minutes after I ordered. Pizza is not good for just one person, so I tried to order Chicken parm, but was told they were out of cutlets or breading or something. Made the wrong choice with the Philly Cheesesteak. Meat wasn't good or tasty - think it was steak- umm style - and the sandwich was a hot mess. Steak fries that came with sandwich were a savior and new Heiz dip-it ketchup condiments give it one star. Luckily, I also ordered garlic bread with cheese which wasn't anything specatular, but at least made me not go find another menu and was edible. Looks like Big mana is a Los angeles chain, maybe they forgot to bring good ingredients up to Vegas. Pick another menu off the motel rack."
3,"We stopped in on a Saturday night after seeing the sign.  We were going to grab some sushi but hadn't noticed Ca\u00f1a before and wanted to try it seeing as we're fans of tapas.\n\nLots of small plates meant to be shared.  We ordered a salad, meatballs, hamachi ceviche, crab ceviche, churros, Cuban sliders, ahi tuna flatbread, and several drinks.\n\nDrinks were great.  Food was excellent.  However, the ceviche isn't really ceviche if that's what you're looking for.  The hamachi was sliced sashimi style with an delicious dressing.  Crab was more like a crab salad and had a metallic taste as if it were canned.  The crab ceviche was the only dish that wasn't excellent.\n\nService is good.  Definitely a good place for groups.  It's rather noisy so be warned.  Can't wait for the weather to warm up so we can try the outside patios."
1,"We decided to order from here based on Yelp reviews.... Overall I wasn't too impressed.\n\nWe ordered a small Margarita, small deluxe, garlic knots and a small antipasto salad. We hoped it would be worth the $60 we spent, but the pizza was NOT as thin as we hoped. The garlic knots, we're very dough-y and shaped more like blobs. The antipasto salad was mixed greens with rolled luncheon meat---nothing more. \n\nWe'll keep searching..."
0,"At first I though the place was ok, not especially tasty or anything, but good enough if in need of some calories. But after further reflection, and after burping fried chicken burps for about 4 hours after eating, I've decided that big in japan isn't worth the trip at all. The food court seating is somewhat lame as well."
0,"Horrible service. Came here with my 13 yr old daughter. Took 30 minutes to get a bowl of garlic fries, almost an hour to get our food. Waitress was more interested in socializing with the tables of loud, obnoxious drunks, than serving a dad and his daughter. Even had to wait to pay my bill. Finally got up and paid my bill at the front desk. Food quality has gone way down since I started coming here a few years ago."
2,"I'm sorry but i'm so disappointed, with my visit to PNC Park, it's not as cool or as nice as I thought it was going to be. You can see yellow bridges and some buildings from the ball park, oooooh. Not that big of a deal, the stadium is just kind of blah there's nothing really to it, I don't know how people can say this is in the top three ball parks in the big leagues!  I'm not sure this ball park would be in my top 5.\nIt was about 50 50 cubs to pirates fans. Well maybe more cubs fans, pretty sad when the visiting team has more fans at your ballpark. The Pirates fans that are here dont even seem to be watching or even have a care about whats going on. Until the Pirates took the lead. \nThere are some really cool statues in and outside of the ball park. I can't really say any more positive things about the park beside the area is pretty cool.\nThe people in Pittsburgh WOW, you are all amazing, you guys are the nicest people! Sorry I couldn't say you had one of the best ball parks."
3,I have to be honest and say that I buy most of my books on line.  The reason I am reviewing this place is because my wife and I immediately come to this place if we have any time to kill before our movie starts at the Tempe Marketplace. We were here the other day and I liked the variety of magazines they have in the front so I don't have to walk all the way to back for some mindless reading when killing time.  I love American history and they had a very nice section of Time Magazine specialty issues about the American Revolution.  Gotta give it to Barnes and Nobles for enhancing my down time in the best way.
2,"This is a pretty cool place, after visiting three other places. We ended up purchasing our kids pinata from here. They have a huge selection to choose from. They also have a huge selection of party themes. They have everything from cups, decorations, candies, and props. Workers were very helpful and the prices are very reasonable."
2,"#1 good location.  #2 cheap rooms, you can get them like $70 or so during the week or as low as $200 on hotwire on super special occasions, where others on the strip will run $300-500.   #3 the bars inside are kinda lame, but they did have a patron silver special with corona which was a good deal  #4  why don't they have coffee makers in the room?     #5   rooms do have a refrigerator, but common a couple bottles of water would be nice for the thirsty traveler    #6 AC didn't work in the room, hmm    3 stars bc its cheap relative to others on the strip.   The TV was a little outdated, super small and takes 10 seconds to respond to anything.  However who watches TV anyway so whatever.   Location and price do seem to be acceptable, so its A-OK in my book!   The patron shots were also A ok as well ;)"
0,Okay coffee. But I think people only go here to see girls in lingerie make coffee! Haha but if that's what people like!
3,"The food and service were good.\n\nI'd recommend the french onion soup, chicken liver pate, and mushroom crepe.\n\nAlso, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the Bellagio water fountain show.\n\nEverything on the Las Vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck."
2,"All you can eat buffet. But be careful, you have to finish what you order!\nThey will charge you for whatever is not finished.  \n\nWe went with a group of 10. We had a whole table to ourselves and it wasn't very busy. We probably arrived there around 8pm. \n\nWe ordered a couple things at first so we can all share, but as we went along, we ordered more, which was perfect.  The different sushi rolls were really cool and really good! I got the Snow White, spicy octopus (2 pieces) and a number of others I can't remember. but Snow White was realllly good. The First Kiss sushi roll was also delicious.  \n\nI got the passion fruit saketini. It was good but it was really sweet and you can barely taste the alcohol. I would recommend getting the lychee saketini or ordering the buy 2 get 1 free beer (Asee, I think it was). \n\nThe udon noodle soup was a little sweet as well. But the soup was good to have with all the sushi. Jalepeno poppers was amazing and it wasn't spicy. \n\nWe also got the Japanese Lasagna sushi. it was odd, there was cheese, sauces, and panko (i think it was) on top. A whole mixture of flavors. it was kinda odd, weird, okay tasting. I'd say try it..but don't let it get too cold or else you won't want to finish it. \n\nUnfortunately, they don't have sashimi. :(  I really wanted that with the spicy red pepper sauce (choh goh chi jang).  But they do have \n\nI gave it 3 stars because they charge you for whatever is not finished.  :(  lol but the servers were really nice, really friendly and helpful."
2,"I have to agree with Dan in saying that the staff didn't seem too excited to be here on the weekend. I came in on a Saturday for a quick lunch before running errands and I was pretty excited after the rave reviews that I read. Unfortunately, as soon as I was seated and started munching on the chips, I was disappointed. They were bland and a bit cold. I didn't let that totally bash my excitement though; I just salted them a little and enjoyed. The salsas were interesting; they were very fresh tasting, but lacked any sort of explosive flavor that I was expecting (The red is much better than the green). With the bland chips, it wasn't much of a pairing, but with the salted chips, I was pleased. \n\nFor lunch I ordered an al pastor burrito and a barbacoa sope. The burrito was awesome! I actually really liked that it wasn't huge. What it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. The barbacoa on the other hand, wasn't as good. On the menu it says that barbacoa is only served on Saturday and Sunday. This is apparently because El Napolito's barbacoa is made with lamb. I've had plenty of barbacoa before and I was expecting to be blown away...especially after having some great al pastor, but I wasn't. The meat was really gamy, like really gamy. Salsa and a little salt were needed to make my sope enjoyable, and that was a shame.\n\nI would return to El Napolito, but there are loads of great little Mexican places in the area that I'll be stopping by first."
0,"I am a big fun of French food and patisserie, I used to go to that  place 3 times a week for breakfast or lunch, but everything change there during this last year, I order Marquez, and they serve it to me almost burned, u cannot taste any thing.  \nLast Sunday I was there they close at 4pm, I was there  at 3pm, and I want to order omelet, the server there she told me the kitchen is close, we can't cook anything, come on!!\nI had many bad experiences there, I will never go back, there are many other French bakery in vegas"
2,"2.5 starts for really crappy service!!!\nFor such a nice place, you'd think they'd have better service.  Holy frijoles, it sucked!  I went for the game night that Glenn and Bri planned.  I finally saw a guy walk by in a suit and said (in my not-so-quiet voice) \""I'll never come back here again.\""  He came right to our table with more Yelpers and said \""Are you guys the Yelpers?\""  I had to actually raise my hand, like in 3rd grade, the rest of the night to get refills on my drink.\nThe food was good.  Only good.  The crab cakes were AWESOME.  Huge hunks of crab, and only crab, coated with a light crumb and served on a sauce with REAL horseradish.  The fries?  Not so good.  Their only saving grace was that they were coated in Old Bay seasoning.  They were just normal shoestring fries, though.\nI really doubt I would go back just to eat.  \nThe ambience is really nice, though.  I just think that for a hotel restaurant, which in itself is in the HOSPITALITY industry, they'd have better service.  At one time, our server even changed color!  He said he was from Cuba.  I called him Fidel.  He laughed."
0,"Horrible customer service! \n\nThe first time I stopped by, I picked up a couple items. I asked about a military discount. The cashier answered that they had one, but she'd have to re-ring me up and was too busy for that. \n\nThe last time I went there, I picked up two compression sacks, something I've been needing. Went up to the register and was told the items would not ring up. After 10 minutes of just standing, I was told that they didn't \""sell those items.\"" I was baffled, how could they have something in store, in a bin, that they didn't sell? I questioned it and was told the two items were supposed to be with sleeping bags and were not for sale on their own. I told the associate I had the exact same compression sack at home in yellow that I had bought from them, so I knew those items were sold separately and were sold at that store. The guy shrugged, apologized, and left me standing there.\n\nThe prices are fair and that's the only reason I think I even attempt to purchase items from there. Their customer service is horrible, though, and honestly makes me feel like paying more at REI is worth it."
0,"Ehh...\n\nWe decided to try this local sushi/teppenyaki place for a friend's birthday. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service!\n\nDifferent items were given at random times. The bento boxes came first, and all of the raw sushi (which doesn't require MUCH preparation!) came last...I seriously waited for more than an HOUR for my nigiri! It wasn't even a busy Thursday night! I noticed that the sushi chef was just serving those at the sushi bar, and the waitress didn't even try to bug the chef to hurry it up! I was the last one to receive my food! The food wasn't even that great either! The salmon nigiri was kind of slimy, and the spicy tuna was just alright; The rolls were seriously not worth the wait! The waitress tried to be nice later, after I told her that it took TOO long, and she gave us 4 bowls of green tea ice cream on the house....didn't really win me over...I still feel that I should have been comped for it...\n\nWe ended up staying at this crappy restaurant for almost 2 1/2 hours! I will never go here again! Please save yourself the trouble, and go somewhere that you know will have GOOD sushi (even if you have to drive far!)!"
0,"Well, the extra star is really for the fact that I love our front-loader washer and dryer and that they were on sale. Didn't go to our regular Lowe's (Ray Rd) as they didn't have the models in stock. Absolutely disgusted and appalled at their customer service or lack thereof when it came to the delivery and installation. We were told they would call us Saturday morning to confirm our delivery slot. To err on the side of caution, we even called to confirm Friday night. Three phone calls later on Saturday morning, we come to find out that our order isn't even ON THE TRUCK! Seriously?! To add insult to injury, the \""manager\""  (I use this term loosely),had the audacity to ask if he could deliver it tomorrow! Absolutely unreal. So it's now noon, we still don't have our new appliances nor any idea of when they will be delivered. What an absolute joke and waste of a perfectly good Saturday. Thanks Lowe's, just how I wanted to spend my weekend, waiting for you jokers to get your crap together. Thumbs down!!!! Do not recommend the Chandler Road to anyone! We have always been very loyal to Lowe's and this seriously makes me think about switching our alliances to home depot!"
4,"Haven't been to BJ's in a while and we went last night for the Pary for Two special they have for Sept.  My first time for pizza, the BJ Combo was excellent, couldnt finish it.  I usually have Jeremiah Red but decided to try the Oktoberfest last night, Loved It!  And after the Pizookie, yummy i wanted to sleep.   I love the food, service and atmosphere at BJ's especially the BEER."
0,"The fries were terrible, there are no free refills, burger was just ok, and they have false advertising with the free milk shake!! Don't eat here ever!!!!"
3,"Ever since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale, I haven't wanted to drive to downtown Phoenix since it's such a far drive, especially after work during rush hour. Unfortunately, that means I'm missing some of my favorite restaurants! With a specific craving in mind, I went on a search and found Tommy Bahamas. After looking at their menu and their Happy Hour, I told my husband we were going here after work last Friday. I'm glad we did, because we had a really great time!\n\nWe arrived about 5pm and it wasn't too packed. We had the option of sitting outside for Happy Hour, or going upstairs into the restaurants indoor bar. We chose outside since the misters were going and wanted to unwind after being inside all day. Our waiter was quick to arrive and take our drink orders. Both of us ordered the Crazy Cuban off the HH menu - a cocktail of rum, pineapple juice, and banana liquor. It was one of my cravings and it definitely hit the spot! Then we ordered the fish tacos and edamame hummus off the HH menu as well. My husband ordered the crab bisque off the dinner menu. The food arrived quickly and we dug in. The tacos were great. We both really enjoyed them and would order them again. The hummus was okay. It was cold and came with long rectangular crackers they called flat bread. To me, flat bread is like pita bread and they were crackers. There's a difference. My husband thought the hummus was good and he ate more of it than me. Still a little hungry, we decided to order the Cuban. Oh god, I am so glad we did. It had pulled pork, ham, gruyere cheese, pickles, and spicy mustard. This was a flavor combination of the gods. My husband and I really enjoyed this and it's our new favorite. It came with Yucca Fries, which we decided to try, but you could sub them for something else. (Yucca Fries are made from the root of the Yucca plant and are like deep fried potatoes - they weren't anything special in my opinion.) Finally, the dessert tray came circling around. They had so many delicious looking desserts to try. A chocolate cake, a butterscotch pudding, a pineapple cr\u00e8me brulee, a pina colada cake, and a chocolate malt tart. We ordered the chocolate malt tart but it was a tough decision. (We'll have to come back to try some of the others.) The tart was delicious was very heavy. We took about 90% of it home to enjoy later. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and we'll be back. I'd recommend going during Happy Hour especially!"
4,"Excellent rooms and service.  Well worth the price.  From the time I was picked up at the airport to the time I was dropped off back at the airport, the Hotel32 staff attended to all of my needs.  Highly recommended."
3,"If you have a Platinum Amex you get to go in for \""free\"" (or the annual cost of the platinum card which more than covers the cost of your 1 buffet meal in the Centurion lounge). The chairs are comfortable and the food is fine. The lounge gets crowded so once you find a seat, you should probably stay. Haven't been to other Centurion lounges but hopefully they are all like this one."
3,"I like the Light Rail.  Just wish it went more places.  From my house I can walk 10 minutes to the nearest stop, and from there go to Harkins fancy new theater at Christown, do some shopping while I\""m there. Or do a day off of Phoenix Art Museum, the Heard Museum, lunch at Fez, down to City Center.  Some days it's fun to go down to Mill Ave and wander.  Sadly, Snottsdale denied the light rail a home, so I have to drive to work (or take my bike on the rail and then ride my bike for another 20 minutes uphill)....I may as just well bike the whole way.  \n\nGreat value, $5 for a day pass, ride it all you want.  Don't understand the crabby attitudes of some of these reviewers.  Drive your gas guzzler all you want and stay off the light rail if you hate it so much."
4,"Best fucking park in baseball. Tickets are reasonably priced and the view is awesome of the downtown skyline. I try to go to visit other parks every year, and this was my first time to PNC. This is just an all around awesome park and it puts my Nationals Park to shame."
2,"My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.\n\nWe both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. \n\nThe pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. \n\nBut let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!"
2,"Are you as confused as me as how to pronouse sygn? When all it is really is an i replaced by a y? \n\nAnyway, it's an upmarket bar. I didn't find the prices insanely hiked - not exactly Wetherspoons, but I've certainly seen worse as well. Definitely not a place you want to come with a semi-dry wallet and itch to leave unable to stand. It looked more like a place you would sup a cocktail or a glass of vino rather than chug on a steiner. My only small quibble would be the extensive cocktail menu didnt' cater for the dd's like myself - although the Firefly selection of drinks were pretty delicious.\n\nHowever, overall I thought it was rather nice - a pleasant bar with table service, pleasant staff who remembered orders and didn't go too crazy even when they had guests waiting to take their (reserved) table that we had hijacked earlier on in the day (note - when I say hijacked, i mean we agreed with the waitress that we would sit there til they needed to reset the table in advance of their reservation). I would be happy to return here but definitely a little closer to pay day."
0,"My wife and I left this evening (Cinco de Mayo) without being served or approached 15 minutes after seating ourselves in the bar. When we got up to leave the manager/bar tender asked where we were going, and when I told her wasn't any staff to wait on us on this usually bust night in Mexican restauarants she said ahe didn't have time for any complaints...totally non-professional.\nNeedless to say, we won't return in the future."
2,"who really knows if this is good pho or not, i was hung tha fuck over and in desperate need of pho therapy. :P but it totally hit the spot and came out super freakin fast!!! omg! aaahhhhh.....\n\ni'm pretty sure it wasn't bad pho tho...meat, noodles, broth, all a-ok. the coffee was good too. thought i was gettin ripped off for a $3 cup of coffee but they gave me a big cup so it's all good! :)\n\nima make pho a must the next time i go to vegas again fo sure!!! yum! :D"
0,"Not impressed at all. Thought they would have a better selection of food with the price  that you pay. I was really upset that we got charged a mandatory gratuity fee because a family member was seated next to us. The waitress asked if we knew her and when we said yes, the waitress automatically insisted that we pay this mandatory gratuity. I mean doesn't she have to wait on the other tables surrounding us? It made no sense and she wouldn't or couldn't explain the theory behind it. After paying this \"" mandatory gratuity\"" we couldn't enjoy our dinner and decide to leave. I was really looking forward to the Wicked Spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had, it just didn't happen."
4,"If I could give Baguette Cafe 4.5 stars I would -- only because I want to them to be open weekends!\n\nThis is truly one of the gems in Las Vegas. I try to make it in here one or twice a month. Oliver and the staff are amazingly warm and familial. And the food is fantastic. It's clear there is a great deal of care taken into the creation of each dish. The balance of ingredients is spot on. Oh, and the bread... oh my god, the bread. I keep meaning to ask if they sell it. It's perfection. \n\nI lived in France for 3 months when I was in college, and this is truly the only place I've been to since that really reminds me of the food and atmosphere there."
4,"Rick the Pool Dude is the main dude I would trust with my pool. I've had some issues with previous companies and Rick is the most knowledgable of the business. From a minor leak I had to maintaining my pool, Rick does a great job.  He is prompt and gets the job done how it should be. I wouldn't call anyone else but Rick the Pool Dude."
0,"Over rated.. Bad service and expensive food. I ordered shrimp on linguine and it was dry, under cooked and not tasty. Serving size is small even for dinner. Price is high, and not even delicious which makes it not worth it. There are many other good restaurants in Venetian / Plazzo, try others but not B&B."
2,Typically we like to try the mom & pop traditional style pizza places but last night was a PJP delivery night. It was a Netflix night and we didn't feel like driving anywhere so we opted for pizza delivery. Fast delivery and friendly guy to boot. The wings are pretty good and I would order them again but I liked the old style a little better.\nPizza was starndard PJP's pizza. Out of the big chain pizza joints we think PJP beats out Domino's and Pizza Hut by a mile from a taste and quality perspective. I really like the online ordering feature.
3,Third trip here and the NW pub burger is the best.The staff has been great every time. Also a must try are the bacon cheddar potato pancakes. Nice atmosphere inside and out.:)
3,"Both reviews for the place are great but I think they forgot to mention one key problem with laser quest. \n\nThe game has started and you're darting around looking for cover. While hiding behind a pillar to avoid the hail of lasers that threaten your life, you hear some footsteps approaching from behind you. You turn quickly to ambush the enemy, only to find out he's 7... \n\nSomewhere in you're brain, alarm bells start ringing. Even though it's fake, your mind hesitates a little to shoot a kid at point blank range. By the time you've bypassed that thought and pull the trigger, he's already buggered off. \n\nIf you're playing with kids, you'll loose (but you're a good person!)"
2,"Thought I wrote a review before but maybe not.  Food very good. Drinks weak.  Tasty food but the prices are higher than you would expect  well, than what I expected   I'm not sure What you consider excessive.   But I just wouldn't go back because of price   Cave Creek is not where you think for oriental food, but we do have some other less expensive options in the area   I hope they read these reviews, because I see the running thread is price"
3,"Very lucky to have this gem near my home. RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICES on fruits and vegetables.... have been shopping here since the beginning, and kinda stopped because it was getting.. dirty, and the produce was a bit...funky... a few months of shopping at Fry's for such things, and I got fed up... returned to Mekong Supermarket, this evening to do some serious shopping, and was thrilled to see that they have been doing a great job of keeping the store clean again. Also, the vegetables were BEAUTIFUL.... seemingly WEEKS fresher than what the major grocery chains are trying to push for at least triple the price... Of course, there's so much more to this store than just fruits and veggies... I took a gaze at the meats today, but didn't really stumble on any great deals, but at that point I was quite tired, lol... Fab selection of just about everything you could imagine from the Asian continent.. some nice beer/wine choices too.."
4,"A rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.\n\nI haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good."
1,"Bathrooms are dingy, decent Jerky selection. \n\nWater and Gas are super expensive - tank up before you cross the desert.\n\nLots of dirty kids in the parking lot.. what's up with that?"
1,"Surprisingly, not so good.  The wait staff is a little on the snooty side.  I had a filet mignon that was sitting on about a teaspoon of spinach and a few dried tomatoes, with a bit of shaved truffle on top.  Sounds great, but it turned out to be a very dry steak and it was overcooked too.  For a $59 steak, I expected it to at least be cooked correctly.  My dining companion ordered the same, and his was under-cooked.   I wouldn't go back there.  For a great meal, I recommend heading to Red Square at Mandalay Bay.  Red Square's steak is terrific, and everything else on their menu is fabulous too.  Don't waste your time at The Country Club at Wynn."
0,"This place is tiny. We were so excited to sing karaoke. Then we found out it would be 1 1/2 hours, before it would be our turn! And there weren't many people there. What a dissapointment."
2,"Just as the title implies the burgers are flame broiled to perfection. I have never had a bad burger here. \n   It's a little on the expensive side, but if your craving a specialty burger it's totally worth it. \n   The downside is that unfortunately most other things on the menu aren't really worth the money. The hotdogs are small and the gyros aren't exactly the best either. luckily the fries are not to salty and have a home made taste.\n   There a good areas to eat outside and there is a drive through window. Also they can deliver in most cases which is always a nice treat."
2,"I LOVE the food at Fromagination.  This store has bailed me out of more than one dinner party.  There is an exceptional variety of everything.  And, even better, the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable about pairings and has solid suggestions for any occasion.  It is also the perfect stop after a Farmers Market trip on Saturday to round of the purchases with good cheese.\n\nThe store has a crazy-funky cheese smell, but it is clean, attractive, and well-lit.  Like the Old Fashioned, it is a great stop when hosting out of towners.\n\nThat being said, your personal experience will vary WIDELY with each visit.  The staff has a rather schizophrenic approach to customer service.   Some are extraordinarily helpful and approach the shop like a welcoming culinary experience.  \n\nHowever, some of the staff approach the shop like it is the cheese version of Louis Vuitton.  Cold, condescending, and borderline rude.  Before I walk in I always have the brief internal debate about whether it is worth the gamble that day.  \n\nSuggested tip: Never ever try to use a Groupon here.  Just pay full price.  You'll be so much happier with your experience."
4,Place kills it!\nGreat service and awesome pho Fasho...\nGood boba selection. The little homie who works the floor is coo as heck. The coolest thing about this place is that is clean clean..
0,"The first time my family went here, we had an awesome time. Good time with good company. We played volleyball until midnight. We had such a good time, we came back the next night. But the 2nd time wasn't as charming. When we got there and all of the volleyball courts we taken so we were just waiting for one to clear up. Finally, when we got a chance to get on a court around 10:00. The lights turned off, which isn't a big deal because we played in the dark the first time. Then a blonde girl (not sure if she's apart of VBGB staff because she wasn't wearing uniform) barged on the courts and disrespectfully, kicked us off the court. Someone probably pissed in her cereal that morning because she had the biggest attitude. Which started to annoy us because she was so rude about. But not a big deal, we let it slide and got off the courts but we were confused because we were able to play volleyball on the courts until midnight the day before. But no, it doesn't end there. She went around to all of the servers, talking *excuse my language* shit about us. That's when lines have been crossed. This place has so much potential but unfortunately, staff members needs a lot of attitude adjustment. Rude service calls for rude customers. And for the blonde girl that disrespected my family, well I hope your day is at least a little better than your personality (:"
3,"I've been to Sura several times before, but have never written a review, here it goes...\n\nLocation: Sura has a huge open parking area, most restaurants on Spring Mountain have horrible parking spaces!\n\nAmbiance: The dinning area is spacious,  well kept, and clean. \n\nFood: I love the bulgogi and the short ribs are delicious. I enjoy the fact that it's all you can eat, in addition to it's affordable price.\n\nThe only upside to Sura, is the fact that the waiters don't change the grill until they're asked to do so."
4,"The almonds cookies, homemade bread, etc. are incredible!!! The service is magnificent and the owner, Henry, is the nicest of the nicest. If you are in need of a great atmosphere with some awesome sweets, this is the place to travel miles and miles to get it."
4,"Delicious! Amazing, fresh food. Creative dishes. Wonderful staff. LOVE this place. Returning ASAP. :)"
1,Usually get my coffee at Starbucks but decided to try it out here since we got a new one and everyone raved about it. The customer service was awesome. Girls were cheery etc. But when I got my frozen drink it was watered down and had no flavor. I'll have to try it out again sometime when I'm in the mood.
2,"We found ourselves in Lawrenceville for dinner and came to find Frantuary. We went around the members of our party to see if we were all OK with what would be a hot dog/sausage dinner, and when they came to me I said \""I am in heaven.\"" I relate this part of the visit because I review this restaurant as someone with sausagemaking in my heritage.\n\nI liked Fraktuary a lot. The atmosphere was perfect for this part of Pittsburgh. The service was equally remarkable. The menu was eclectic yet varied sufficiently that all members of our group found something of interest. The food combinations that we had were well prepared and quite delicious.  There really is nothing negative to say about the meal whatsoever.\n\nThe issues that I have with this restaurant have to do with the cognitive dissonance of dining in an upscale hot dog restaurant. I just could not get past the fact that I was paying $15 for what amounts to a dog, fries and a beer. I can see bringing people here for the upscale atmosphere, but I think I would be otherwise uncomfortable treating someone to a meal as simple as a frankfurter, if it were that special of an occasion.  Therefore, if I want a stadium dog, I will find someplace more 'downscale' and if I have a special occasion, I will look for a more upscale menu."
0,This buffet reminds me of Golden Corral which I can go to for a third of the price. It is dated and dirty. Everything seemed so unhygienic.  I had a hard time eating much. The food was overcooked and dry. It did not seem very French at all. I would not recommend this place at all.
0,"I wish that I could rate this place zero stars or negative stars.  \n\nHere are just a few things that I did not like: \n\n1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. \n\nThe bathroom was, in their own manager's words, \""disgusting.\""  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several \""clean\"" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). \n\nUntil this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was \""disgusting\"" and \""unacceptable.\"" He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. \n\nI got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. \n\nLesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. \n\nThe housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. \n\n2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. \n\n3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western \""macho\"" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. \n\n4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi. At least it was fast wi-fi."
2,We liked Crush Lounge better than Christopher's. I guess that means we liked the smaller plates and appetizers better than the entrees. And it's a little pricey if you just kind of like the food. Probably not going to return.
2,"I've had Wicked Spoon bookmarked for the longest time.  I had plenty of opportunities to eat here, but promised my teenager that I wouldn't eat here without her. \n\nSo it's set. She's in town for a couple of days and Wicked Spoon was on her radar this time around (I swear, she's a Yelper in training).  We purposely arrived about an hour near closing because I figured that the lines wouldn't be as bad then.  I was right, only waited about 20 minutes to get into our seats.  Overall service was great and for that I cannot complain.  I feel the ambiance and the decor.  I even love their tables and wish I had that pattern at home.  But this review is about the food, right? \n\nIn my opinion, if you've been to one buffet in Las Vegas, you've been to them all.  The dishes here are served in mini-portions, which I think is great for pictures.  But lousy for a buffet.  When I think buffet, I think as much as I want.  Give their Fried Chicken Wings as an example.  You get two pieces presented in a cute stainless steel strainer.  But if I wanted 6 pieces, I would have to grab 3 of these bad boys, really? How about their Angry Mac N' Cheese.  The portions are small and if I wanted a little more, than I'm grabbing multiple tins of these.  Again, great for photos, but not convenient for eating.  This is pretty much the experience with all their mini-dishest.  By the time I was done, I've tried their fried chicken, roasted chicken, salmon, sushi (don't do it), mac n cheese, and their garlic pizza.  All were just about par with every one else on the strip.  Not bad in taste, not the greatest either.  \n\nNow for dessert...This is where Wicked Spoon has their one shining moment.  It's all about desserts here.  From presentation to taste, you really can't go wrong with their desserts. Their macarons weren't that great, but everything else disappeared once it made it to my table.  \n\nOverall, I have to give Wicked Spoon just 3 stars because it's just okay compared to the rest of the strip buffets out there. For $35 a person for lunch, I think I could get more bang for my buck outside of the strip.  I'm sure I will eventually be back.  Just remember, I'm not paying for dinner."
3,"We visited One Square armed with a voucher from Amazon Local for a daily 3 course menu meal with wine, aperitif, canapes and coffee after.\n\nHotel bars and restaurants are not often visited by non hotel residents. This bar is no exception. Which is a pity for the people in Edinburgh that appreciate good location, excellent service and fine dining. I think One Square definitely deserves a place amongst the poshest of cocktail bars that this city has to offer. So what it is part of the Sheraton Hotel? It is still an establishment that caters for paying customers - and more. The prices are no more expensive than many of the bars you'll find in this category. \n\nOn arriving I was courteously greeted at the bar and advised that the it is table service, I took residence in one of the green designer chairs in the window, overlooking the Festival Square, Usher hall  and the Edinburgh Castle. They brought me my beer (Innis & Gunn from the draft - \u00a34.90) and served with it a very generous selection of almonds and jumbo peanuts, yum.  Taking in the surroundings you cannot help but think, understated opulence. Dark red velour resting sofas with loads of scatter pillows to prop up against. The window seats are the aforementioned green designer chairs with high curvy backs, which act as sound barriers to keep the conversation to the table you are seated at. \n\nDrinks menu looks like a gin blogger's nirvana - 51 gins from 7 different countries - wow. \n\nWhen seated in the restaurant we got a gin (No3) and tonic as an aperitif. with some beetroot and salmon mousse canapes. They were shaped like mini ice cream cones. According to Anita A. they were yummy! (I don't eat fish) \nWe were supplied with 3 different kinds of bread & butter to wet our appetite a little further\nFor our 3 courses day menu (choice of 2 starters,2 mains and 2 desserts) - I started with a crab soup - never had it before. Will not repeat that. It was nice, but not to my taste. For main I had chicken breast, creamy potatoes and a squared breaded meaty thing. bit of a mixed bag, but well prepared. \nAll this we washed down with a bottle of Chilean Merlot 2013.\n\nThe dessert is where they shone the most. I had a warm banana cake and cinnamon ice cream with some honey mango coulis - sharp & sweet. I just wished there was more. The size was decent: I wanted more.\n\nWe exited the meal with a cappuccino and a frangelico liquor side.\n\nA very pleasant meal in well presented surroundings. The staff was impeccable. Well done to One Square. \n\nWould I go back - yes - but I will choose my own main next time instead of the limited choice of the daily menu"
2,"I'm not much of a golfer. In fact, I downright don't like the sport. But I've been to Callaway a few times to hit balls. For that purpose, Callaway is A-OK. The prices seem reasonable for a bucket or three. They even have a special right now (not sure how long it is intended to last) that gets you unlimited golf and range balls for $19. Now, I know my coworkers have experienced issues with the unlimited golf deal, but for the driving range, it sounds like a pretty good deal to me (especially if you somehow, magically share said range balls with friends)."
0,"The food in this restaurant is ok, but the service attitude is suck. Especially one waitress in this restaurant, she is so strict and never smile. She looks like my professor Mr. Kolenich because both of them seem to have a bad mood all the time.\nIf you love Chinese food, I recommend this restaurant to you, but you should better take out. Also, customers cannot choose the amount of tip because they will charge the tip automatically if you pay by card. Anyway, i don't like this restaurant, and i won't go to this restaurant anymore."
4,"This is a great service, I have used this on three occasions to buy show tickets and tickets to exhibits. This really saves you a lot of money, in some cases 50% savings on a show or an exhibit. \n\nThe only downside is there always seems to be a long line to get the tickets, and when you buy your tickets you don't get a ticket, just a voucher which you have to go to the box office of the show to exchange for a ticket. The only problem I had with this is when I went to see an exhibit, waited in line for a half an hour for the voucher, then went to the actual exhibit and had to wait for another half hour for a ticket. But with the savings you get it is worth the hassle."
3,"Breakfast to die for!!!\n\nMy wife and I got in late, and woke up the next day hungry. We wanted breakfast so I yelp for local places.  We have tried Hash House a Go Go, great place when not watching your calories.  I saw other places with comments $40 for breakfast ya da, ya da.  We were staying in the Venezia tower and had eaten at Bouchon's before. \n\n I noticed that Bouchon served breakfast so I was game.  I was not disappointed.  French pastry's, European coffee, what could be better.\n\nI ordered the omelet of the day, stuffed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and cheese.  Perfect eggs, good sausage, with brioche toast.\n\nMy wife had the bread pudding French toast with warm Carmel vanilla sauce. \""Heaven on a plate\"" according to my wife.  \n\nThe service was great, and for the strip, and an upscale restaurant the $38 dollar breakfast was another great moment.\n\nIf you stay anywhere near this place it is a must try for breakfast."
3,"The only problem with our Saturday in Montreal is that by 6 p.m., we'd caved to the temptation of a great breakfast, steak frites lunch and afternoon cocktails and snacks.  For us, Le Sarah B was the perfect stop for the evening \""meal\"" - Rose and chicken wings!    Those wonderful chicken wings, perfectly seasoned and fried.  Recommended seating is around the corner behind the curtains - banquettes and pillows invite one to respectably sluggardize.  Bok bok!"
3,I ordered the teriyaki bowl and it was great food for the price.  Quite impressed by the variety of options on the menu. Not sure if this location was the one I tried.
0,"This Starbucks is the worst I've been to. They don't get your name when you order (which I believe is company policy). They don't even say the name of the drink they put on the counter so it's essentially just best guess as to what drink belongs to who.   And don't ask the baristas, I believe they enjoy the confusion. I'm yet to get what I ordered and the white chocolate soy milk latte I took home last week was quite terrible.\nJust go somewhere else. It's truly not worth it."
1,"False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains."
0,WORST SERVICE EVER!! people are SOOO SO SO RUDE!! the yogurt is SOOO GROSS!! noone go here !!!! its the worst frozen yogurt place in the valley! needs to be shut down!
1,"As I was eating dinner at La Cave the other night, I was debating that this review could go anywhere from a 2 star to a 4 star.  We ate there with a group of 6, and since it is Tapas, we were able to try almost everything on the Menu.  Unfortunately, nothing was super memorable.  I'll start with the highlights.\n\n1) Our server was very nice.  Great personality and even gave some good recommendations for offstrip restaurants.\n2) The Beef Filet was quite was good.  That and the Charcuterie plate were probably the two best items that we had.\n3) The wine selection was quite good.  The Sommelier acted of high importance, but didn't show any action for his promises.  As shown below.\n\nThe bad:\n1) The restaurant is in the Wynn, and prices were as expected.  They were not outrageous, but for the quality of the food, they seemed a bit high.\n2) As we were eating the duck, the Sommelier asked how the duck was.  I told him that it was chewy and not very good.  At first he acted surprised, and said he would take it off the bill.  As the norm, I said, \""oh no, that's ok\"" (still expecting him to do it).  He then replied, \""other people have said they didn't like either.  I'm taking it off for you guys.\""  I figured if he DID stand behind that comment, that would def. bump La Cave up a star.  If he didn't, then it goes down a star because it was that bad.\n3) Other disappointing dishes were the overcooked and small Scallops, the watery grits, and the chewy lamb.\n\nLa Cave is a 3 star restaurant for the mediocre food, and above average service for the strip.  All dishes were \""OK\"" and nothing blew any of us away.  It was all just OK.  As you guessed, the duck remained on the bill, and as expected, the Sommelier was just giving us words.  I doubt I will be back to La Cave, and gladly try other restaurants in Vegas."
0,This place is disgusting. I think I may have had the worse restaurant food in my life today.
0,"Quality ingredients and good recipes ruined by bad chefs.  The caesar salad had no flavor.  It tasted like lettuce, water and shaved parmesan.  The pepperoni pizza had obviously been sitting a while.  It was so dried out and all the pepperoni slices were even curled up at the edges.  The crust was like bisquick.  It tasted just like a frozen pizza.  The chipotle barbecue chicken sandwich was served ice cold, which I guess is ok but they really need to warn you.  It's not too much of a stretch to assume a barbecue sandwich will be hot.  $17 dollars later, and we're still hungry.  \n\nTheir routine is way too complicated for them not to be on the lookout for newbies and tell them what to do.  They seemed to get their entertainment sitting quietly behind their counters watching all the customers wander around aimlessly like bumper cars.  Thanks guys."
4,"Best, and Biggest candy store in AZ. What else do you need to know!?\n\nThey have almost everything you can imagine. Went today & got some prank jelly beans for the candy dish at the office. Never grow old my friends!! Visit Sweeties and put some youth in your routine."
3,"I believe in second chances. And I better, since it's literally in my neighborhood. I tried the shrimp salad, the cheese quesadilla. And, I also finally tried an Agua Fresca! The food was great. The shrimp salad was a great value. I needed to update my previous review- this a Mexican restaurant, with a better quality of food. You get what you pay for. And it's a good thing."
3,"Apparently they have the best poutine in town. If you are new to this, I would go for the original poutine - fries with cheese curds, smothered with yummy gravy. If you want add a kick, try their different variations with merguez sausage, beef etc. Yes, it's a recipe to heart attack but it's oh soo good! The atmosphere inside is cosy and if the weather is nice, definitely check out the outdoor seating."
4,JESUS HAS RETURNED...\n\nin the form of Black Cod Miso.
2,"This hotel is just meh.  Nothing to write home about except for the fabulous location.  Didn't do anything more than sleep there, so I can't comment on the bistro or anything else.  A good place to stay if you can get a great rate."
4,"I really like this place. The people are very nice. I recently made the mistake of going somewhere else playing into the hype of being pampered in a \""girly\"" setting. Paid way too much and hated it. I went the next day to have kisses fix the problem. I am now a loyal customer. They may be small and it may get crowed in there, but the work they do is great. They do try to \""upsale\"" you but they are in a business to make money. And the services they offer is only a benefit to you. \n\nThank you Kisses! See you in a couple of weeks!"
3,"Appearance wise...its an OK place set in a very neat historic downtown hotel. I was there my first time on a really crappy first date. Luckily the food, specifically the carne asada, was amazing. I have been back a couple of times since and although one of the trips was unbearably loud due to their music....i still say the carne is spot on."
4,"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. They have exceptional sangria, great service and staff, and the outdoor misters always wonderful as well."
4,Starting off with a 5 we'got adeal on tickets after seeing show totally would have been happy with paying full price great show funny energetic !!! Great music and production
1,"First time I have been here. I am all about customer service and I was disappointed. The lady behind the counter acted as though I was bothering her while I ordered my food to go. My husband and I can't have cheese on basically anything. So I ordered a bean and cheese burrito for my son- he can have cheese and I ordered a taco combo and she asked \""what type of meat?!\"" In a tone I give my husband when I am bothered... We'll excuse me... I didn't know there were options. Geez. Mind you I had my 10 month old daughter with me which might have been why that lady seemed bothered because my daughter was babbling while I was ordering. I ordered a fish taco and a drink. I waited and it didn't take long to get my food. So I went into the car strapped my daughter in and then realized she didn't give me my drink. I walked in again and waited for her to even acknowledge me and I told her I didn't get my drink. She even seemed bothered by that. Fish taco and carne asada tacos were smaller than expected. Food was ok... Not the best I have had. I would have given another star if the customer service was better."
2,"Don Pedro's is a good spot.  Probably the best Mexican I've had in this little area so far.  Their lunch specials are really affordable, most are $5.95 and they serve salsa and pico de gallo with their chips.  Yum!  The wait staff is friendly and quick and they wear little Spaniard-esque uniforms.  I had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was satisfied with the selection.  At the end of the meal they brought out some type of cinnamon/raspberry sauce giant chip with whip cream on top.  Nice little meal ending surprise."
0,I made appointment prior to coming here but still waited for an hour. The place is nice but looks can be deceiving because of the bad service they provided me. Please don't waste your time coming here totally not worth the wait!!!
0,"Being in the restaurant business I understand times are tough. Any type of promotion to bring in guests that is feasible would give the \""edge\"" to a particular business. Frequenting this particular applebees I felt like I just walked into club applebees. The volume is way over the top. Service was compatible to a crowded bar with one bartender to serve. I sat at a table to wait 10 minutes before even being greeted by my server. With the music it came as no sunrise that the food order came out totally incorrect. After trying to stomach through the wrongly prepared item, I had to regrettably send it back. After 2 minutes it came back corrected with the quality parallel to Taco Bell. The identity is in question, the food is a pathetic excuse for a full service franchise, and service that I could find in a dive bar. Highly disappointed in this franchise as of late. Past three visits to different area locations have ended in similar fashion. So sad."
3,"Love the unabashed use of fresh foods. The menu is short, but everything I've had on the menu has been great. The brunch menu is also pretty awesome. I would definitely get the donuts again. If the place was just a littttle bit bigger, it'd be awesome."
0,Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.
1,"I have been to this restaurant twice, HATED the food.  The last time I went I had a great bartender. I can't remember her name, but she was good. Too bad the food couldn't live up to the service. Very poor quality menu! Great weekend drink specials and service, but food SUCKS!!"
3,"So, I dug this show and I'm not a Soprano's fan.  They kinda had me at \""How Ya Doin!\""  When you walk into Soprano's you walk in to a strip club, they even give you stripper dollars.  It's kinda awesome at the kick off.\n\nHowever....the show starts and they make you watch this scene to introduce you to all the characters that are being lampooned from the show.  It pulls you out of this great surrounding and then makes you watch a play....not too cool.\n\nThat being said, the actors a fun to talk to and play with.  The food was kinda awesome. So, for interactive theater, the Soprano's wasn't half bad.  Be prepared to get out of your chair alot, there's more dancing and involvement than Tony and Tina's."
4,I look forward to getting out of the house once a week to go bowl at the center always a good time with friends and staff
4,"Visiting AZ for spring training and golf. After a round of golf we want to check out a sports bar for beer and food. This was a great pick. The walls a covered with TVs, the staff is friendly, the food is great and the beer is cold. Great sports bar!"
3,"Great food, awesome selections!"
3,"Any and everything that you want about after-hours is inside of this amazing new edition to the Vegas late late night/early morning scene!  \n\nThe music was more of a mixture- the usual electronic-house-pop with a decent amount of hip hop and top 40!  I's definitely what you're looking for if you came to dance to the songs you know....\n\nWe went on a Thursday, were comped at the door ( for being pretty ladies?)  \nBut was a completely different story on Saturday night - the place was packed and if you weren't on the list or in the know, then you were S.O. L \n\nI do feel the later in the evening/ or morning rather.. they were less selective with the crowd...\nBut nonetheless a great time - large dance floor next to the DJ booth!"
2,"I've enjoyed every bite of food I've tried off the Buzznbeez food truck. The Jamaican Jerk/BBQ chicken sliders are an intriguing combination of sweet and heat. I also got a chance to sample the fried chicken and hot link BBQ combo, and was enchanted with the spiciness of the batter that coated the chicken.\n\nThe menu seems to shift quite a bit, so I haven't gotten a sense of the entire repertoire of goodness offered by this sunny bright-yellow addition to Phoenix's food truck scene. I want to give them four stars, since the food is so tasty, but I've had some issues with their customer service, so I withhold one star. The day that Food Network was filming Buzznbeez at the New Times parking lot food truck court was a disappointment to my dining buddy, who, after ordering the fried chicken and waiting patiently for nearly 20 minutes, was told they were out of that item. Fortunately, a Sonoran hot dog was mere steps away, off of another food truck. I enjoyed my food, with the exception of the mac-and-cheese which I found flaccid. I had ordered coleslaw as my side dish anyhow, so this was some sort of last-minute substitution I suppose.\n\nSo despite some missteps, I am willing to continue to get food from the Buzznbeez truck. I want to see them succeed and add to the fabulous panorama of flavor that is rapidly becoming a standard amongst the finer food trucks in the Phoenix metro area."
3,"Went for the first time today for lunch. Had the enchilada and shredded beef taco. It was great! They accidentally brought a cheese enchilada instead of beef. The waiter caught this and brought out a beef one even though I said I was fine with the cheese. Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back for dinner now."
2,"I'm rating the Bingo here.  This place is really fun and cheap.  You can play and play all day and sometimes actually win.  And if your are lame like me you can get a machine to do all the work.  This place is stuffy, stinky and seedy but you're in Vegas so why not.  They have a smoking section in the Bingo hall but it might as well be the whole place because its one small room that hasn't been renovated since who knows when.  You get free donuts, chips and sodas.  The bar waitress comes in and gives free drinks and if you tip her well she will come back over and over again.  This place is fun to try out when you are tired of the strip and/or have time to kill before a flight.  Oh and don't forget to sign up for their players card it comes with a coupon book that has an additional bingo discount.  And BEWARE of the bingo sharks there.  Since I've been there a few times you tend to see the same locals who are hard core with tons of cards and machines that win all the time!"
2,"It's the typical Harkins.  Yeah, I have a stack full of cups back home that I always forget to bring.  : )\n\nThey really need a better selection at the snack bar of some foods that are not high fat and high sodium.  And snack bar prices for what they do have are insultingly high.  They are pretty proud of their food."
1,"Service was ok and food wasn't any better.  The Orange chicken was ok, however the egg drop soup and fried rice left a lot to be desired.  Price is pretty good for a big lunch.  I don't think I'll be returning."
1,"This place is cool but I've had better Mexican food. The carne asada tacos are good, not a fan of there guacamole. I've also had better. My family liked it. I can go without coming here again. I loved the different varieties of meat and the spicy pork is the best taco here and of course I love my Horchata..can't go wrong with that. It's always overcrowded and you have to go on a hunt just to get a seat. Good thing is it's open late a good place for a quick grub or after the club hunger in Vegas."
3,"I went here on a sunny spring day with my wife for lunch.  It has a cool modern atmosphere with direct views of the capitol from almost any seat.  The burger I had was good, but very messy.  I think the bun could have been slightly bigger.  I like the huge ceilings inside.  Overall a good option on the square that I will try again.  I think happy hour here could be a good idea especially with summer on the way and their big tap beer selection."
1,"Ok, so I held off writing a review here from my 1st visit, which was when they were brand new, about a year ago.  It has definitely remained exactly the same.  \n\nI was out for a date night on the 1st time around, and wouldn't you know it?   Loud, obnoxious, rowdy, big group, who were not only inebriated from the previous ball game which they just crawled off a bus from, but continued to drink their heads off with regular spurts of raucous laughter.  It got even worse, as they then celebrated a birthday in the group.\n\nmoving onward...\n\nYou seriously have to gawk at the likes at what constantly walks in here.  \n\nJanuary....\n\nI mean, I was sitting outside on the beautiful patio next door at Ocean Prime, and my teenager couldn't help but roll his eyes in disgust at what the 50 year old ma'ams (or is it Madames?) and the get-ups (or lack of them).  Looked like freaky muppets with all that hair, googly eyes, big lips, plastic-y, and other extraordinary cartoonish characteristics.  \n\nTIme MARCH-es on\n\nSo, on yet another date night, I go to head to the sexy patio at Ocean Prime, but it was closed off due to wind.  SO I groaned and thought, ok, we'll ck out the next outdoor establishment, since it seemed pretty quiet - shock.  \n\nAfter sitting down, it didn't take long to realize that I felt unclean, got the creeps and thought how trashy this and the patrons in it were.  To top it off, I didn't see any wines by the glass. \n\n I'm otta here.  \n\nWe quickly made a dash to the swanky & very classy  indoor bar area of Ocean Prime.  Had an amazing glass of red wine.  Nice music.  Sexy d\u00e9cor.  Everything was good.  The earth was set back into it's perfect rotation."
4,Mexican Benedict zomg!
3,mmmmm....yummy food! Did not except such good food to be honest.
2,"Picture a first date.  You meet this guy.  Good-looking, seems nice (maybe a little \""too cool for school\""), but you are intrigued. You start chatting and collectively decide to grab a cup of coffee.  And after an enjoyable interlude, you get up, give a small wave, saying, \"" I gotta run, I'll call you, this was fun\"" knowing very well you will never see or speak to this person ever again.  And you just can't explain why.  This is how I feel about Fate."
3,"My second visit was MUCH better than the first.  The General Manager /staff/server made every effort to make sure we had a wonderful brunch for my mother in laws 85th birthday.  I will say that the General Manager contacted me after my first yelp review and told me to contact him when in town to give the restaurant another try.  As a small business owner, I was totally impressed with this personal touch.  It also resulted in a very pleasant second meal at Morels.  \n\nWe dined inside on this visit, and that was a very pleasant experience.  Nice, crisp, clean dining room with lovely paintings (of a sexual nature!) on the walls.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.\n\nMy husband and I shared the fried prawns, and they were DELICIOUS!  I loved the basil dip that came with it and saved it to go with my frites.  YUMM.  I ordered the steak frites, which was very good....even better with the dip (or pistou as the menu calls it).  \n\nWe had a lovely bottle of champagne to celebrate our great meal.\n\nI will happily return in September for brunch when I am at my yearly conference in Vegas."
2,"Just another reason why I love the Aria (#1 reason- that vanilla smell!  Supposedly it's an aphrodisiac).  Julian Serrano's atmosphere is great- I wish I had taken a picture of the pretty trees all around the restaurant.  \n\nAnd boy do I love tapas. Here's what we got (or at least what I remember)\n\nAhi Tuna Tempura with avo & mango salad and wasabi foam: The foam was a little strange to me but the ahi was delicious!\n\nGrilled Angus Flat Iron Steak w/ Eggplant and mushroom demi: MM.  Possibly my favorite.  Super tender and the eggplant was bomb!\n\nSalmon with Truffle:  Okay, wait, this one was my favorite.  The truffle sauce was a revelation... HAHA.\n\nTuna Cones: Hm, not bad...but I preferred the tuna tempura.\n\nChicken Chilindron: Pretty good, I didn't really like the combo of tomatoes, chicken and ham initially but after a few bites really warmed up to it.\n\nPan Manchego: Oh man, I may have to change my mind yet again because this was so freaking good.  Evolved bruschetta.\n\nThe server didn't know if bread was free or not, but gave it to us anyway and later found out it wasn't (but didn't charge us, win!).  Basically consumed my body weight in free bread, because man those tiny plates are hard on the wallet."
4,"Allyson is the BEST! I had a consultation with Allyson and I knew right away she was the midwife for me. My first delivery 5 yrs ago was at a hospital with a doctor, and although it was a natural and uncomplicated delivery I knew this time around I wanted a much more peaceful experience. I was so happy to have an hour at every appt to discuss all my concerns. Allyson always made me feel like I was in control of my pregnancy and with her help I would have the healthiest and safest delivery possible. Whenever I had lab work or ultrasounds she called me as soon as she got the results, she knows how stressful it can be to wait for results. My husband and daughter were always included in the conversations and in the measuring of the baby's size and heart rate. It made my daughter feel very special. We always left our appts feeling like we had just visited with a friend.\n\nWhen I went into labor, Allyson was at my house within 30 mins if not less. I wasn't sure how I wanted to labor, but she encouraged me to do whatever felt good to me. She showed my husband, mother and daughter how to massage my back, it was so nice to have them be part of the delivery. She was very soothing and gentle with her coaching. I wanted my husband to catch our son, but he was hesitant in fear of dropping him. Allyson walked him through it and made him feel comfortable with it. My husband caught our son and is so grateful to Allyson, he said it was the best experience he's had. I truly believe that Allyson's love and care for me and my baby (entire family) is the reason why I had the peaceful delivery I wished for. I could not ask for a better midwife, and if baby #3 comes along.....I will be calling Allyson."
0,"Really, cleaning and changing the taps at noon, AKA \""lunch time\"" on a Friday?Downright stupid! Been 10 minutes waiting for a simple beer and the taps are still not assembled. Anticipating they'll taste like soap :-("
2,"What is all the hype for this place? Came here for breakfast and was so disappointed!  Obviously breakfast is not their forte or I there would be more reviews here aside from their evening menu....\n\nThe chilli con carne.... overrated.  Yeah, I said it. The meat tasted like it came straight out of a can. \n\nThe toastada special was alright, but ive had better. Unfortunately for everyone at my table it was the only thing with flavor. \n\nThe home fries tasted like they sprinkled cheezeits on them. What are these batteted with?\n\nThe breakfast burrito was just OK. \n\nHonestly if I were here again I would have to save my appetite strictly for dinner only. But breakfast? I'll pass."
