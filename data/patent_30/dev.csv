"fig1 shows the qualitative relationship between the throughput m of superfluid helium - ii flowing in a gap with the gap width s and the pressure drop δp along the gap . accordingly , there are two flow regions indicated by dashed lines for the he - passage through narrow gaps , a narrow , socalled &# 34 ; linear region &# 34 ; with a flat , approximately linear slope of the curve , and an upper , so - called &# 34 ; gorter - mellink region &# 34 ; with a substantially steeper slope of the curve . in the &# 34 ; ideal region ,&# 34 ; only gaseous helium still leaves the gap . in the &# 34 ; gorter - mellink region ,&# 34 ; a mixture of gaseous and liquid helium is discharged . according to the invention described in the following , the gap width s is varied by the phase separator , so that a very accurate control of the throughput in the &# 34 ; ideal region &# 34 ; is possible . the throughput m for helium - ii in the ideal region is : ## equ1 ## where b = gap width transversely to the flow direction , as can be seen from the formula above , the throughput is proportional to the third power of the gap width s and the reciprocal value of the gap length 1 . contrary to the known solution , the present solution therefore utilizes the dependence of the gap width s on the third power with the gap length 1 constant . from this , the following advantages result : if required , the throughput can also be made zero , i . e ., the phase separator can also be shut off without other devices . because the gap width s enters with the third power , the control sensitivity is considerably greater than with a control of the gap length 1 . a disadvantage of the known solution , that when the throughput goes to infinity as 1 goes to zero , is avoided . because the region in which the gap width s is changed is small , a solid state drive , for instance , a piezoelectric drive can be used , in which the adjustments proceed entirely without friction . in the embodiment shown in fig2 the entire phase separator is fastened via a flange section 7 to a tank filled with superfluid helium - ii by means of an appropriately designed tank nozzle 8 . the phase separator comprises essentially a disc element 1 as well as a ring element 2 , the free end face 2 . 1 of the ring element 2 together with an opposite surface 1 . 1 of the disc element 1 forming a radial gap 3 . the disc element 1 is fastened to a control element 4 . 1 of a piezoelectric drive which is in turn connected to the ring element 2 . the electric drive 4 can be a continuously variable drive or a drive operating in individual steps in the order of nanometers , for instance , a so - called &# 34 ; inch - worm ,&# 34 ; which allows an adjustment of the radial gap 3 in the range between 0 and at least 15 μm . the drive can optionally also be arranged outside the he - ii tank at a different temperature level as constant as possible . in this embodiment , the superfluid helium - ii enters radially from the outside into the radial gap 3 and then flows into the interior formed by the ring element 2 . via a heat exchanger 5 connected to the interior , in which possible liquid which might have passed the gap is evaporated in the tank by heat exchange with the superfluid helium - ii , the gaseous helium flows off and can be conducted due to its residual heat , for instance , through the heat insulating system of a cryostat . in the embodiment shown in fig3 only the parts forming the radial gap 3 as well as another drive for setting the gap are shown . to the ring element 2 are fastened , distributed uniformly over the circumference , three setting devices 9 which act on correspondingly associated parts 1 . 2 which are arranged , uniformly distributed at the circumference of the disc element 1 . a control element 9 comprises a yoke 9 . 1 which is firmly connected to the ring element 2 and encloses a drive 9 . 2 in the upper region , and the control element 9 . 3 of which pushes perpendicularly on part 1 . 2 of the disc element 1 . on the side of the part 1 . 2 opposite the control element 9 . 3 , a spring element 10 is arranged which is braced against the yoke 9 . 1 and pushes part 1 . 2 against the control element 9 . 3 . since three such devices 9 are provided , the surfaces 1 . 1 and 2 . 1 forming the radial gap 3 can be adjusted absolutely parallel to each other . the parallelness can be monitored , for instance , capacitively by means of an electrode layer vapor - deposited on one of the gap - forming surfaces . while with the two embodiments described above , only relatively small helium mass streams can be managed , fig4 shows an embodiment , in which a multiplicity of radial gaps can be connected in parallel and the gap widths of which are simultaneously readjusted by a piezoelectric drive . the embodiment shows an arrangement with three radial gaps . the gaps are formed by disc elements 11 . 1 , 11 . 2 , 11 . 3 and ring elements 12 . 1 , 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 . the ring elements 12 . 1 to 12 . 3 are kept at the same spacing by identical spacers 13 . 1 and 13 . 2 . likewise , the disc elements 11 . 1 to 11 . 3 are kept at the same spacing by two spacer sleeves 14 . 1 and 14 . 2 . the spacer rings 13 . 1 and 13 . 2 have radial holes 13 . 11 and 13 . 21 for supplying the helium - ii to the radial gaps 16 and 17 . the disc elements 11 . 2 and 11 . 3 have axial holes 11 . 21 and 11 . 22 for the passage of gaseous helium . the disc elements 11 . 2 and 11 . 3 are sealed by diaphragm elements 18 and 19 against the ring elements 12 . 1 and 12 . 2 , with which they do not form controllable radial gaps . the superfluid helium which enters through the openings 13 . 11 and 13 . 21 , thus cannot circumvent the controllable radial gaps 15 to 17 . the disc elements 11 . 1 to 11 . 3 are axially adjusted relative to the corresponding ring elements 12 . 1 to 12 . 3 via a push rod 20 and a drive , not shown , so that the gap width of the gaps 15 to 17 can be adjusted in the desired range between 0 and 15 μm . as is readily seen , the flow through the radial gaps in the above - mentioned embodiments need not necessarily be from the outside in ; the flow direction of the helium can also be in the reverse direction if the liquid or gas , respectively , is conducted in the appropriate direction . in the foregoing specification , the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof . it will , however , be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims . the specification and drawing are , accordingly , to be regarded in an illustrative rather than in a restrictive sense .",5
"throughout all the figures , same or corresponding elements are generally indicated by same reference numerals . these depicted embodiments are to be understood as illustrative of the invention and not as limiting in any way . it should also be understood that the drawings are not necessarily to scale and that the embodiments are sometimes illustrated by graphic symbols , phantom lines , diagrammatic representations and fragmentary views . in certain instances , details which are not necessary for an understanding of the present invention or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted . the problems associated with gyrostatic effect and the corresponding components have already been described above with reference to fig1 . according to the invention , the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n that is produced by the useful machine system as a result of the temporal change of the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n , is compensated by a counter - torque { right arrow over ( m )} g produced by an additional machine counter - system , which produces a counter - torque , as indicated by dotted lines in fig1 . the machine counter - system has been omitted from fig1 for sake of clarity . turning now to fig2 , in a first embodiment of the invention , a motor 3 drives via a rotating shaft 15 a load 1 that is fixedly secured to the axle 4 that rotates with an angular frequency ω n . the rotating load 1 , the shaft 15 and the rotating components of the motor 3 ( e . g ., the rotor of the motor 3 ) form , as in fig1 , a rotating useful machine system that has a useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n in the direction of the axle 15 and the load 1 , respectively . a rotation of the axle 4 by an angle φ produces a useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n as a result of the temporal change of the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n . according to the invention , the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n is compensated by a counter - torque { right arrow over ( m )} g produced by the machine counter - system . the machine counter - system includes the rotating components of a second motor 12 , which is offset with respect to the axle 4 by 180 °, a rotating shaft 16 driven by the second motor 12 and a compensating load 14 . the rotating machine counter - system rotates in the same rotation direction as the useful machine system , but the counter angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} g is oriented in a direction opposite to that of the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n , because the machine counter - system is offset with respect to the axle 4 by approximately 180 °. it should be noted that the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n , the counter angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} g , the moment of inertia of the useful machine system { right arrow over ( j )} n , and the moment in inertia of the machine counter - system { right arrow over ( j )} g are expressed as vectors . the machine counter - system rotates with an angular frequency ω g which is controlled by a controller 20 indicated schematically in fig2 by a dotted line . the magnitude of the counter angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} g is equal to the magnitude of the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n , i . e ., with | { right arrow over ( j )} n · ω n |=|{ right arrow over ( j )} g · ω g | ( 3 ) the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n and the counter angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} g , and the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n and the counter - torque { right arrow over ( m )} g then compensate each other so that ideally the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n can be almost completely compensated . fig3 shows another embodiment of the invention , with the components in fig3 having the same reference numerals as the components in fig2 . the compensation mechanism of fig3 for compensating the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n is in principle arranged and operated in the same manner as in the compensation mechanism of fig2 . however , unlike the machine counter - system of fig2 , the machine counter - system of fig3 is formed essentially by a rotating load 14 and by a rotating shaft 16 that drives the load 14 , i . e . without the motor 12 . the machine counter - system is driven via a gear 13 by the same motor 3 as the useful machine system . a portion of the rotating mass of the gear that rotates with the angular frequency ω g of the machine counter - system can be associated with the machine counter - system , whereas another portion of the rotating mass of the gear that rotate with the angular frequency ω n of the useful machine system , can be associated with the useful machine system . the gear ratio of the gear 13 is selected so as to satisfy equation ( 3 ). in the embodiment of fig3 , unlike in the embodiment of fig2 , the gear ratio of gear 13 may disadvantageously not be continuously adjustable by a controller 21 ( only indicated schematically in fig3 by dotted lines ), so that the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n or the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n may therefore not fully compensated . the gear ratio of gear 13 can , of course , be adjustable , but may be fixed to simplify the implementation . however , the embodiment of fig3 advantageously does not require a separate motor that drives the machine counter - system . fig4 shows another embodiment of the invention . a rotating useful machine system and a rotating machine counter - system are pivotally supported on axle 4 . the useful machine system is hereby formed by a useful load 1 , a shaft 15 and a rotating component of a motor 3 . the machine counter - system is formed by a counter load 14 , a shaft 16 and the rotating components of a drive motor 12 . if the useful machine system is tilted , for example by an angle φ 2 , then the resulting useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n can be compensated by rotating the machine counter - system in the opposite direction by an angle φ 1 , wherein | { right arrow over ( j )} n · ω n |=|{ right arrow over ( j )} g · ω g | ( 4a ) φ 1 = φ 2 ( 4b ) the machine counter - system is tilted so that the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n produced by the tilting motion of the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n is compensated by a counter - torque { right arrow over ( m )} g produced by the tilting motion of the counter angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} g . the machine counter - system can be tilted by a separate drive that operates independently of the drive that tilts the useful machine system , or the tilting motion of the machine counter - system can be suitably coupled via a gear with the tilting motion of the useful machine system . it should be noted here that it is quite difficult in practical situations to completely compensate the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n , since the moment of inertia of the load 1 of the useful machine system can vary and is frequently not exactly known . in such cases , the useful angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} n and the useful torque { right arrow over ( m )} n , respectively , can be at least partially compensated by the corresponding counter angular momentum { right arrow over ( d )} g and the counter - torque { right arrow over ( m )} g by estimating the moment of inertia of the load 1 and / or the moment of inertia { right arrow over ( j )} n of the useful machine system . accordingly , the actual situation can also be significantly improved for these situations . alternatively , the counter - torque { right arrow over ( m )} g and / or the moment of inertia { right arrow over ( j )} n of the useful machine system can be measured so as to control the rotation speed , i . e ., the angular frequency ω g , of the machine counter - system , so that the magnitude of the counter angular momentum becomes substantially identical to the magnitude of the useful angular momentum . this measurement can be performed , for example , by using suitable sensor electronics and / or by measuring , for example , the energy required to accelerate the useful load 1 or to accelerate the useful machine system . the moment of inertia { right arrow over ( j )} g of the machine counter - system can be kept small to minimize the required installation size . in this case , the rotation speed , i . e ., the angular frequency ω g of the counter - system , can be increased proportionally to again make the magnitude of the counter angular momentum identical to the magnitude of the useful angular momentum . while the invention has been illustrated and described in connection with currently preferred embodiments shown and described in detail , it is not intended to be limited to the details shown since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention . the embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and practical application to thereby enable a person skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated . what is claimed as new and desired to be protected by letters patent is set forth in the appended claims and includes equivalents of the elements recited therein :",8

"embodiments of the present invention will be explained below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings . note that the invention is not limited thereto . a display device according to a first embodiment of the present invention shown in fig1 is an active matrix display device . the display device includes a pixel array unit 2 , a data line driver dd , a scanning line driver sd , and a controller cnt synchronized with the data line drier dd and the scanning line driver sd . although fig1 shows only one display pixel pix , the pixel array unit 2 actually includes a plurality of display pixels pixs arranged two - dimensionally in a matrix . each display pixel pix includes a light emitting element 21 constituted by an oled , a drive transistor tdrv , two switching elements tems 1 and tems 2 , a reset transistor trst , a vt detection transistor tdet , a bias transistor tbias , a capacitor cap , and a scanning transistor tscan . the light emitting element 21 , the first switching element tems 1 , and the drive transistor tdrv are connected in series between a first power supply vdd and a second power supply vss and constitute a current path . a current carried on this current path causes the light emitting element 21 to emit light . the drive transistor tdrv is an n - type tft ( thin film transistor ) at least a channel part of which is formed out of amorphous silicon . the drive transistor tdrv controls the current carried on the current path between the first power supply vdd and the second power supply vss . the drive transistor tdrv can thereby drive the light emitting element 21 to emit light at a desired brightness and a desired gradation based on potential data received from the data line driver dd . it is assumed that a drain - side node of the drive transistor tdrv is n 1 , a source - side node thereof is n 2 , and that a gate - side node thereof is n 3 . an anode of the light emitting element 21 is connected to the first power supply vdd and a cathode thereof is connected to a drain of the first switching element tems 1 . a source of the first switching element tems 1 is connected to the node n 1 . namely , the first switching element tems 1 is connected between the light emitting element 21 and a drain of the drive transistor tdrv . the vt detection transistor tdet is connected between the node n 1 and a gate of the bias transistor tbias and used to detect a threshold voltage of the drive transistor tdrv . a gate of the vt detection transistor tdet is connected to a first scanning line lscan [ n ], where n is an integer . the bias transistor tbias is connected between a second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] and the node n 3 . the bias transistor tbias is connected to the node n 1 if the vt detection transistor tdet is conductive , and transmits a potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] to the node n 3 according to a potential of the node n 1 . the reset transistor trst is connected between the node n 1 and a third power supply vref . a gate of the reset transistor trst is connected to a reset line driver rd . a reset line lrst is connected to the gate of the reset transistor trst from the reset line driver rd . the reset line driver rd controls the reset transistor trst via the reset line lrst . the third power supply vref has a higher potential than at least a threshold voltage of the bias transistor tbias . the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ] are connected to the scanning line driver sd , and each of the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ] is provided to correspond to each of pixel rows of the pixel array unit 2 . if the corresponding pixel row is to be driven , a potential of each of the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ] is raised to a positive potential ( e . g ., + 10 volts ( v )). in a standby state where the corresponding pixel row is not driven , the potential of each of the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ] is kept to a negative potential ( e . g ., − 10 v ). the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ] are selected ( activated ) in order of lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ]. note that “ activation ” means turning on or driving an element or a circuit and that “ deactivation ” means turning off or stopping an element or a circuit . accordingly , a high ( high level potential ) signal is an activation signal on one occasion and a low ( low level potential ) signal is an activation signal on another occasion . for example , an nmos transistor is activated by making a gate thereof high . a pmos transistor is activated by making a gate thereof low . a first electrode and a second electrode of the capacitor cap are connected to the node n 3 and a node n 4 , respectively . namely , the capacitor cap interposes between the gate ( n 3 ) and the source ( n 2 ) of the drive transistor tdrv . the second switching element tems 2 is connected between the nodes n 4 and n 2 . namely , the second switching element tems 2 is connected between the electrode on one end of the capacitor cap and the source of the drive transistor tdrv . the scanning transistor tscan is connected between the node n 4 and a data line ldata propagating data . the capacitor cap applies a potential difference between the gate ( n 3 ) and the source ( n 2 ) of the drive transistor tdrv if the light emitting element 21 is driven to emit light . the data line ldata is connected to the data line driver dd and provided to correspond to each of pixel columns of the pixel array unit 2 . the data line ldata transmits potential data for driving the light emitting element 21 to emit light at the desired brightness and the desired gradation to the corresponding pixel column . gates of the vt detection transistor tdet and the scanning transistor tscan are connected to the first scanning line lscan [ n ] selecting the display pixel pix including the vt detection transistor tdet and the scanning transistor tscan in common . accordingly , the vt detection transistor tdet and the scanning transistor tscan operate at the same timing . the first and second switching elements tems 1 and tems 2 are controlled by a signal vems propagated on a switching line lems . the signal vems is a signal activated if a current is applied to the light emitting element 21 to drive the light emitting element 21 to emit light . namely , the first and second switching elements tems 1 and tems 2 are switches that turn conductive when the light emitting element 21 emits light at the voltage held in the capacitor cap . with the configuration mentioned above , the display device according to the first embodiment applies a negative potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv before the potential difference for driving the light emitting element 21 to emit light is held in the capacitor cap . it is thereby possible to return a shifted threshold voltage of the drive transistor tdrv to an original threshold voltage vth . while fig1 shows only the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ], the number of scanning lines can be larger than two . further , while fig1 shows only one data line ldata , the number of data lines can be larger than one . with reference to fig2 , an operation performed by the display device according to the first embodiment will be described . fig2 shows only the operation performed by one display pixel pix . since operations performed by the other display pixels pixs can be easily estimated from fig2 , they are not described herein . before t 10 , the scanning line driver sd selects a scanning line lscan [ n − 1 ]. this is a state where the pixel row corresponding to the scanning line lscan [ n − 1 ] is selected . a potential vdata of the data line ldata is vn − 1 and pixels pixs corresponding to the scanning line lscan [ n − 1 ] emit light based on the potential data vn − 1 . at this time , the first and second scanning lines lscan [ n ] and lscan [ n + 1 ] have a low level potential (− 10 v ). in the first embodiment , a high level potential of the scanning lines is set to + 10 v . however , the potentials of the scanning lines are not limited thereto . nevertheless , the low level potential of the scanning lines needs to be the negative potential to recover the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . at t 10 , the scanning line driver sd deactivates the potential vems [ n ] of the switching line lems [ n ] to the low level potential . the first and second switching elements tems 1 and tems 2 are thereby turned off , and a frame selected just previously ( before t 10 ) finishes its light emitting operation . right after t 10 , the reset driver sd activates the potential vrst of the reset line lrst to the high level potential . right after the activation , the scanning line driver sd raises the potential of the first scanning line lscan [ n ]. as a result , the third power supply potential vref is applied to the gate of the bias transistor tbias via the reset transistor trst and the vt detection transistor vdet . a potential of the node n 1 is set to the third power supply potential vref . the bias transistor tbias turns conductive to thereby apply the potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] to be selected next to the currently selected first scanning line lscan [ n ] to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv . that is , the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] in a negative potential state is connected to the gate ( node n 3 ) of the drive transistor tdrv . as a result , a negative bias is applied to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv and the threshold voltage of the drive transistor tdrv is returned to the original threshold voltage vth . in this way , by applying the negative bias to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv , the threshold voltage of the drive transistor tdrv falling when the light emitting element 21 is previously driven can be raised up to near the original threshold voltage vth . at t 12 , the reset driver sd reduces the potential vrst of the reset line lrst to the low level potential , thereby disconnecting the node n 1 from the third power supply potential vref . thereafter , during a period from t 12 to t 13 , the scanning line driver sd raises the potential vscan [ n + 1 ] of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ]. the potential of the node n 3 thereby rises to the high level potential according to the rising of the potential vscan [ n + 1 ]. however , if the potential difference between the nodes n 3 and n 2 exceeds the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv , the drive transistor tdrv turns conductive . accordingly , the node n 1 is connected to the second power supply potential vss and a gate potential of the bias transistor tbias is set to the second power supply potential vss via the vt detection transistor vdet . the bias transistor tbias thereby turns nonconductive , so that the potential of the node n 3 ( potential of the first electrode of the capacitor cap ) is set to the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . since the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv is already recovered during a period from t 11 to t 12 , the potential of the node n 3 is set to the original threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . note that the high level potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] needs to be higher than the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . at t 13 , the scanning line driver sd reduces the potential vscan [ n ] of the first scanning line lscan [ n ]. by the falling of the potential vscan [ n ], the vt detection transistor tdet and the scanning transistor tscan turn nonconductive . accordingly , the node n 4 is kept in a state where a desired potential vn is to the potential of the node n 4 . the desired potential vn is potential data for driving the light emitting element 21 of the currently selected pixels pixs to emit light at the desired brightness and the desired gradation . the potential vn − 1 is potential data applied to the pixels pixs connected to the scanning line lscan [ n − 1 ] selected prior to the scanning line lscan [ n ]. a potential vn + 1 is potential data applied to the pixels pixs connected to the scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] selected next to the scanning line lscan [ n ]. the potential of the first electrode of the capacitor cap ( potential of the node n 3 ) is kept vn and the potential of the second electrode ( potential of the node n 4 ) is kept vth . namely , the potential difference held in the capacitor cap is ( vth - vn ). the potential ( vth - vn ) held in the capacitor cap is used to drive the light emitting element 21 to emit light . right after t 13 , the data line driver dd changes the potential vdata of the data line ldata from the desired potential vn to the next potential vn + 1 . as can be seen , according to the first embodiment , the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] selected next to the currently selected first scanning line lscan [ n ] is used . while the potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] is the low level potential ( negative bias ), this negative bias is applied to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv , thereby recovering the original threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . when the potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] rises to the high level potential next time , the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv is detected . thereafter , at t 14 , the scanning line driver sd raises a potential of the signal vems to the high level potential to thereby turn on the first and second switching elements tems 1 and tems 2 . the node n 4 is thereby connected to the node n 2 and the potential difference between the gate and the source of the drive transistor tdrv ( potential difference between the nodes n 2 and n 3 ) becomes equal to ( vth + vn ). further , the light emitting element 21 is connected to the drain of the drive transistor tdrv . the drive transistor tdrv thereby applies a current based on the potential ( vth + vn ) to the light emitting element 21 . the light emitting element 21 emits light at the brightness and the gradation based on this current applied thereto . according to the first embodiment , the negative bias of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] can be applied to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv . the display device according to the first embodiment can thereby return the shifted threshold voltage of the drive transistor tdrv to the original threshold voltage ( threshold voltage before shift ) vth . moreover , according to the first embodiment , during transition of the potential of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] from the low level potential to the high level potential , the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv is set to the first electrode of the capacitor ( node n 3 ) using the potential rising of the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ]. at this time , the desired data potential vn is set to the second electrode of the capacitor cap ( node n 4 ). as can be understood , according to the first embodiment , the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv can be recovered , a drain voltage of the drive transistor tdrv can be reset , and the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv can be quickly set to one end of the capacitor cap using the scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] selected after the currently selected scanning line lscan [ n ]. by applying the first embodiment to the active matrix display device , it is possible to realize a display device capable of maintaining stable display quality for long time and suitable for a large - sized , high - definition display . the power supply potential vref for resetting the potential vems can be replaced by the first power supply potential vdd . in a display device according to a second embodiment of the present invention shown in fig3 , a bias line and reset line driver brd controls the reset transistor trst and the negative bias is applied to the node n 3 without using the second scanning line lscan [ n + 1 ] selected next to the first scanning line lscan [ n ]. the reset line lrst is connected from the bias line and reset line driver brd to the gate of the reset transistor trst . the bias line and reset line driver brd controls the reset transistor trst via the reset line lrst . the bias line lbias is connected from the bias line and reset line driver brd to a drain of the bias transistor tbias . the bias line and reset line driver brd applies the negative bias to the node n 3 via the bias line lbias or controls a potential of the bias line lbias so as to raise the potential of the node n 3 up to the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . the other configurations of the display device according to the second embodiment are similar to those of the display device according to the first embodiment . with reference to fig4 , an operation performed by the display device according to the second embodiment will be described . before t 20 , the scanning line driver sd selects the scanning line lscan [ n − 1 ]. at t 20 , the scanning line driver sd deactivates the potential vems [ n ] of the switching line lems [ n ] to the low level potential . right after the deactivation , the bias line and reset line driver bsd raises the potential vrst of the reset line lrst to the high level potential . at t 21 , the scanning line driver sd raises the potential of the first scanning line lscan [ n ]. the third power supply potential vref is thereby applied to the gate of the bias transistor tbias via the reset transistor trst and the vt detection transistor tdet . the bias transistor tbias turns conductive to apply the potential vbias of the bias line lbias to the gate of the drive transistor tdrv . at this time , the bias line and reset line driver bsd outputs the negative bias as the bias potential vbias . as a result , the threshold voltage of the drive transistor tdrv is returned to the original threshold voltage vth . at t 22 , the bias line and reset line driver bsd reduces the potential vrst of the reset line lrst to the low level potential , thereby disconnecting the node n 1 from the third power supply potential vref . thereafter , during a period from t 22 to t 23 , the bias line and reset line driver bsd raises the potential vbias of the bias line lbias to a higher potential than the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . the potential of the node n 3 is thereby set to the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . since the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv is already recovered during a period from t 21 to t 22 , the potential of the node n 3 is set to the original threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv . at t 23 , the scanning line driver sd reduces the potential vscan [ n ] of the first scanning line lscan [ n ]. the potential vn of the data line ldata at this time is set to the node n 4 . thereafter , at t 24 , the scanning line driver sd raises the potential vems of the switching line lems . the drive transistor tdrv thereby applies a current based on the potential difference ( vth + vn ) between the first and second electrodes of the capacitor cap to the light emitting element 21 . as a result , the light emitting element 21 emits light at a desired brightness and at a desired gradation . since the more detailed light emitting operation performed by the light emitting element 21 is similar to that according to the first embodiment , it will not be described herein . according to the second embodiment , the bias line and reset line driver bsd controls the potential of the reset line lrst and that of the bias line lbias without using the scanning lines lscan [ n + 1 ] selected after the currently selected first scanning line lscan [ n ]. therefore , according to the second embodiment , rising / falling timing of the reset potential and that of the bias potential can be arbitrarily set despite need to additionally provide the bias line and reset line driver bsd . accordingly , the second embodiment can attain the advantages of the first embodiment . moreover , the second embodiment can attain the advantages of recovering the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv , resetting the drain voltage of the drive transistor tdrv , and quickly setting the threshold voltage vth of the drive transistor tdrv to one end of the capacitor cap similarly to the first embodiment . the third power supply potential vref for resetting the potential vems can be replaced by the first power supply potential vdd . in the first and second embodiments , the display element is the oled . however , the display element according to the present invention is not limited to the oled but an arbitrary current - driven light emitting element the luminous brightness of which changes according to a current value such as a charge - injection inorganic el element or a charge - injection electrochemical light emitting element can be used as the display element . additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art . therefore , the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein . accordingly , various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents .",6
"the present invention provides methods and apparatus for launching and decelerating ( encompassing also landing ) unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ). according to an aspect of the present invention , simplified methods of launching the uavs are provided . the subject methods are generally user friendly , designed for automatic launch by even armatures with little training on uav operation , and thus improving user experience and accessibility . the subject methods can permit taking off and / or landing on uneven surface or rough terrain , thus also accommodating a wide range of environmental conditions conventionally unsuited for uav operation . accordingly , in one embodiment , a method for launching an unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ), comprises the step of ( a ) detecting a positional change of the uav ; and ( b ) in response to the detected positional change , activating the uav to generate a lift and / or thrust . a positional change may include translational changes ( e . g ., in altitude , latitude and / or longitude ) or rotational changes . a positional change may also include changes in the velocity , acceleration , and / or orientation of the uav . a positional change may further include a change in location of the uav with respect to a frame of reference or a reference object . in some embodiments , the positional change or positional state may be detected by onboard and / or off - board sensors such as discussed herein . for example , the positional change may be detected by an inertial sensor , gps receiver , compass , magnetometer , altimeter , proximity sensor ( e . g ., infrared sensor , lidar sensor ), visual or image sensor ( such as a camera or video camera ), photo sensor , motion detector , and the like . for example , an onboard inertial sensor ( including one or more gyroscopes and / or accelerometers ) may be used to detect a change in acceleration and / or orientation experienced by the uav . for example , the inertial sensor may be used to detect that the acceleration of the uav is close to the gravity of the earth indicating that the uav is experiencing the freefall motion . similarly , the inertial sensor and / or visual sensor may be used to determine that the vertical velocity of the uav is close to zero , indicating for example that the uav is near the vertically highest point of the a parabola - like trajectory . similarly , an onboard gps receiver and / or visual sensor may be used to detect a change in the location of the uav . in some embodiments , detecting the positional change or positional state may include analyzing sensor data obtained from the sensors . such analysis may be performed by a controller of the uav , a computer or processor at a remote device or station . in some cases , obtained sensor data may be compared against a threshold and / or predetermined value . in such cases the uav may utilize a variety of different sensors with built - in threshold limits . the threshold values may include absolute or relative values , depending on the specific positional change to be determined . for example , the threshold value may include the absolute or relative velocity , acceleration , orientation , location coordinates ( e . g ., altitude , latitude , and / or longitude ), and the like . for example , a detected linear acceleration may be compared with the absolute value of g ( gravity ). as another example , the detected velocity may be compared with the absolute value of zero to determine if the velocity has reached zero , close to zero or has become negative ( such as when the uav has reached or passed the apex of a launching trajectory ). in some cases , instead of or in addition to comparing sensor data to threshold and / or predetermined values , the obtained sensor data may be compared with previously obtained sensor data . for example , frames of image data obtained from visual sensors may be compared and analyzed to determine changes in velocity and / or location of the uav since last time the sensor data is obtained and / or the currently velocity and / or location of the uav . based on the analysis of the sensor data , it may be determined whether the uav should be activated , started or launched . such determination may be performed by an onboard controller , a remote computer or processor , or a combination thereof . in response to the determination , an acceleration or activation signal may be generated , for example , by the onboard controller or a remote computer , to actuate one or more rotors of the uav , thereby causing one or more rotor blades to rotate and generate a suitable lift for the uav . the generated lift may be sufficient to allow the uav to maintain an airborne state . in some embodiments , the generated lift allows the uav to hover over a designated location . in some other embodiments , the generated lift allows the uav to gain elevation . in yet some other embodiments , the generated lift may also allow the uav to change its lateral position and / or orientation . in some embodiments , the positional change or positional state may be caused directly by a human . fig8 illustrates a method for launching a uav , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . as illustrated , a person 801 throws or tosses a uav 802 with non - rotating rotor blades into the air in an arc - like trajectory 803 . at or near the peak of the trajectory 803 , the vertical velocity of the uav becomes zero or close to zero . such zero or near - zero vertical velocity can be detected by an onboard or off - board sensor . in an embodiment , the zero or near - zero vertical velocity may be detected by an inertial sensor and / or visual sensor of the uav 802 . the sensor may provide the detected data to an onboard controller of the uav or a remote controller , for example , via a wired or wireless link . the controller may determine , in response to the detected positional change or state , the suitable actuation signals to provide to one or more rotors of the uav . the actuation signals may be generated by an onboard controller , a remote device or a combination thereof . the actuation signals may cause actuation of the one or more rotors , thereby causing rotation of respective rotor blades 801 to generate the desired lift 807 sufficient to cause the uav to become autonomously airborne . for example , uav may hover over the peak of the trajectory . in an embodiment , instead of or in addition to the positional change of the uav discussed above , the release of the uav by a human hand may be detected . accordingly , in another embodiment , the present invention provides a method for launching an unmanned rotorcraft having ( 1 ) one or more rotor blades and ( 2 ) at least one sensor being configured to detect release of a grip of said rotorcraft by a hand . the method typically involves the steps of ( a ) detecting by a sensor on a uav , the release of the grip by said hand ; and ( b ) in response to the detected release of the grip , generating an activating signal to actuate the one or more rotor blades of the uav to generate a lift and / or thrust . by way of illustration , a uav may be released by the person 801 of fig8 via one or more holding members 810 such as discussed herein . the holding members may be provided with one or more sensors such as touch sensor , pressure sensor , temperature sensor and the like to detect the contact or the lack thereof with the holding members . in an embodiment , the release of the uav from a mechanical or human hand may be detected by such sensors and in response to the detected release . in response to the detected release of the grip by a mechanical or human hand , an onboard or remote controller of the uav then generate the actuation signals that cause the activation of the uav as described herein . in some embodiments , the actuation signals may be generated within less than about 1 second from the detecting step . in other embodiments , activating signal is generated within a range from as little as about 0 . 8 seconds , 0 . 5 seconds , 0 . 3 seconds , 0 . 1 seconds , 0 . 05 seconds , to about 0 . 001 second or less from the detecting step . in some instances , activating the one or more rotor blades to generate a lift and / or thrust is performed within less than about 1 second from the detecting step . in other embodiments , activating signal is generated within a range from as little as about 0 . 8 seconds , 0 . 5 seconds , 0 . 3 seconds , 0 . 1 seconds , 0 . 05 seconds , to about 0 . 001 second or less from the detecting step . in some embodiments , the positional change or positional state may be caused by a mechanical device . fig9 a illustrates an example mechanical device for launching an uav , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the mechanical device includes a mechanical arm 900 that comprises a mechanical hand 906 at one end and an actuator 911 at the other end . the mechanical hand 906 may be configured to hold and / or release a uav 902 . the actuator 911 may include a mechanical motor , electrical motor , spring assembly or any other suitable actuator . the actuator 911 may be controlled locally or remotely by a controller or computer . in an embodiment , the actuator 911 may cause the mechanical arm and / or hand to launch the uav 902 into the air in a similar fashion as the launch by the human hand as discussed above in connection with fig8 . in some embodiments , the uav may autonomously start or activate the rotors and rotor blades in response to detected positional change of the uav and / or detected release of the uav from the mechanical hand 906 , similar to that discussed in connection with fig8 . for example , in response to the detection that the uav has reached or is about to reach the peak of the trajectory 903 ( e . g ., detected vertical velocity is or is near zero ), and / or the detection that the uav has been released from the mechanical hand 906 ( e . g ., via a sensor on the holding member 910 ), an onboard controller of the uav may cause one or more rotors to activate the corresponding rotor blades 901 , thereby generating the desired lift and / or thrust 907 that causes the uav to become autonomously airborne . additional methods for launching the uavs are provided . fig1 a - c illustrate another method for launching a uav 1002 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . as illustrated by fig1 a , an uav 1002 is initially held by a hand 1003 of a human 1001 . in some embodiments , the uav may be supported by a human body or a human hand . the uav may be supported by one or more support members such landing stands or legs . alternatively , the uav may be placed directly on the human body or hand without any support members . in some other embodiments , the uav may be held by the hand via one or more holding members 1005 such as discussed herein . in some embodiments , rather than being held or supported by a human hand , the uav may be supported by any other object such as a removable hard surface . in a typical embodiment , when the uav is thus held or supported , the rotors of the uav are not actuated and the rotor blades are not moving . to launch the uav , as illustrated by fig1 b , the person may withdraw the support of the hand from the uav or simply drop the uav from an elevation position . in the cases where the person initially holds the uav on the palm of a hand , the hand may be withdrawn from underneath the uav . in the cases where the person initially holds the uav via a holding member 1005 , the holding members may be released , thus releasing the uav . regardless of how the uav is released , acceleration of the uav typically changes from zero or close to zero to around g ( gravity of earth ), thus experiencing freefall . such a change of acceleration may be detected by the uav , for example , by an inertial sensor . in some embodiments , instead of or in addition to sensing freefall , the uav may also detect the release of the uav , for example , by a contact sensor ( e . g ., touch sensor , pressure sensor , or temperature sensor ). in response to the detected positional change and / or release of the uav , the uav may spontaneously and autonomously actuate the rotors ( and corresponding rotor blades ) to generate the desired lift and / or thrust 1035 . as illustrated in fig1 c , the desired lift and / or thrust 1035 may cause the uav to hover over or gain elevation relative to the location where the uav was originally held in fig1 a . in other embodiments , the post - release altitude of the uav may be less than the original altitude . regardless of the post - release position of the uav , the uav becomes airborne in an autonomous fashion ( i . e ., without external support ). in some embodiments , visual sensors may be used to detect external signals for launching the uav . accordingly , in a separate embodiment , a method for launching a uav ( including an unmanned rotorcraft ) having a visual sensor and one or more rotor blades is provided , which method comprises the following steps : ( a ) detecting , by the rotorcraft , a visual signal generated by an operator of said rotorcraft ; and ( b ) in response to the detected visual signal , activating the one or more rotor blades to generate a lift and / or thrust . as a variant to visual sensor , the method may involve an audio sensor configured to detect a sound signal which can be a command for launching the uav . a wide variety of visual sensors are useful for detecting the external signals for launching the uav . for example , any visual sensor capable of detecting optical wavelengths within the visible spectrum of a naked eye , infra - red , or ultraviolet wavelength ranges , whether being polarized , high intensity light and / or other types of light wavelengths , are suited for practicing the subject methods . where desired , the sensor can be a camera or video camera , placed on - board or off - board of the uav . in some embodiments , some of the onboard sensors may transmit sensor data to an onboard controller , which in turn provides the sensor data to the remote controller . in some other embodiments , some of the onboard sensors may transmit the sensor data directly to the remote control device , e . g ., as shown 1720 of fig1 . various aspects of the sensing and controlling functionalities may be implemented by onboard systems , off - board systems , or a combination thereof . the external signal being detected can be a visual signal , a voice command , a gesture or movement of an object such as a body part . fig1 - 15 illustrate exemplary methods for launching the uav , in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention . as illustrated in fig1 , a gesture 1310 may be detected by an onboard sensor 1305 and used to trigger the launching of the uav such as discussed herein . the gesture may be made by any body part such as by a hand , arm , head , facial features , eye , and the like . for example , the gesture may include the wave of a hand or arm , the turn of the head , the movement of the eye , and the like . as illustrated by fig1 , a recognizable visual sign , symbol or pattern 1410 may be detected by the onboard sensor 1405 and used to trigger the launching of the uav . such predetermined visual sign , symbol or pattern may be of predetermined color , shape , dimension , size and the like . as illustrated in fig1 , light source 1510 may be detected by an onboard sensor 1505 and used to trigger the launching of the uav such as discussed herein . the light source 1510 may include any light sources so as to provide rgb , uv , nuv , ir , polarized , high intensity light and / or other types of light . the light may be of various wavelengths and modulated in power over time . the gesture or movement for launching the uav may include throwing the uav into the air , releasing or dropping the uav from an elevated position , or providing predetermined external signals to the uav , and the like . such launching methods may be implemented by a human , mechanical device , or a combination thereof . in such examples , various on - board and / or off - board sensors may be used to detect positional changes of the uav , or external signals ( including but not limited to visual signals ), or release of a grip of the uav . based on the detected changes or signals , an activating signal may be generated , for example , by the onboard controller or a remote computer , to actuate one or more rotors of the uav , thereby causing one or more rotor blades to rotate and generate a suitable lift for the uav . the generated lift may be sufficient to allow the uav to maintain an airborne state . in some embodiments , the generated lift allows the uav to hover over a designated location . in some other embodiments , the generated lift allows the uav to gain elevation . in yet some other embodiments , the generated lift may also allow the uav to change its lateral position and / or orientation . in a separate aspect , the present invention also provides simplified methods of decelerating a uav , which can be readily adopted by a uav user with little or no training on uav operation . in some embodiments , the deceleration method can effect landing of a uav at a designated location with little practice by the uav user . accordingly , in one embodiment , the method of landing a uav involves the steps of ( a ) detecting by a sensor on the uav , an external contact exerted upon said uav while said uav is airborne ; and ( b ) generating by said uav a decelerating signal in response to the detected external contact , thereby decelerating said uav . the contact may be exerted while the uav is airborne . the external contact may be detected by one or more onboard and / or off - board sensors such as touch sensor , pressure sensor , temperature sensor , photosensor , magnet , visual sensor , or a combination thereof in response to the detected external contact , one or more decelerating or deactivation signals for causing the rotors to slow down or come to be complete stop . such signals may be generated by an onboard controller or a remote device . in some embodiments , such signals may cause the uav to land at a designated location . in some embodiments , such external contact may be imposed by a human hand . the person may touch , grasp or otherwise hold a portion of the uav ( e . g ., a holding member ) while the uav is airborne . for example , as the uav hovers near or passes by a person , the person may reach out and get hold of the uav by hand or by any other suitable device such as a hook , clasp , mechanical arm / hand , or the like . the uav may detect such contact by an onboard sensor such as those described herein and autonomously slows down or stops the rotors ( and hence rotor blades ) of the uav causing the uav to decelerate or come to a stop . fig9 b illustrates an example mechanical device for landing an uav , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the mechanical device may be similar to that described in connection with fig9 a . for example , the mechanical device may include a mechanical arm 900 , a mechanical hand 906 and an actuator 911 . the actuator 911 may be configured to control the mechanical arm and / or mechanical hand to capture a uav 902 that is within a predetermined range . for example , the mechanical hand may be controlled grasping or otherwise engaging with one or more holding members 910 of the uav so as to capture the uav . an onboard sensor 905 may be configured to detect the contact of the mechanical hand and as a result , autonomously slows down or stops the rotation of one or more rotor blades 901 . in alternative embodiments , the uav may be configured to detect contact with other external objects such as a landing surface ( e . g ., ground or table top ) and slows down or stops the uav in response . similarly , the uav may be configured to detect the contact by a human hand . for example , an onboard temperature sensor may be configured to detect human body temperature on a holding member as a result of a holding of a human hand , thereby triggering the landing of the uav . in some embodiments , other biometric sensors such as fingerprint sensors may be used to detect human contact . in some embodiments , the decelerating or deactivation signals are generated only after the contact is sustained for a predetermined period of time . this may be useful for preventing the uav from being shut down due to temporary and unintentional external contact . similarly , in some embodiments , external contact may be used in combination with other sensor input such as positional changes and / or visual signals to determine whether to land the uav . in some embodiments , within less than about 1 second from detecting the external signal , the decelerating signal is generated . in other embodiments , decelerating signal is generated within a range from as little as about 0 . 8 seconds , 0 . 5 seconds , 0 . 3 seconds , 0 . 1 seconds , 0 . 05 seconds , to about 0 . 001 second or less from the point when the external signal is detected . in some instances , decelerating the uav is performed within less than about 1 second from the point when the external signal is detected . in other embodiments , decelerating the uav is performed within a range from as little as about 0 . 8 seconds , 0 . 5 seconds , 0 . 3 seconds , 0 . 1 seconds , 0 . 05 seconds , to about 0 . 001 second or less from the detecting step . in some embodiments , positional changes may be used to trigger automatic landing of the uav in addition to or instead of external contact with the uav . accordingly , the present invention provides a landing method is provided that involves the step of ( a ) detecting a positional change of the uav while said uav is airborne by the uav ; and ( b ) in response to the detected positional change and / or the visual signal , generating a deceleration signal to said uav to bring said uav to a stop . such positional changes may be similar to those discussed in connection with the launching of the uav . for example , the positional change may include translational changes ( e . g ., in altitude , latitude and / or longitude ) or rotational changes . the positional changes may include changes in the velocity , acceleration , and / or orientation of the uav . the positional change may also include a change in location with respect to a frame of reference or a reference object . in various embodiments , the positional change may be detected by an inertial sensor , gps receiver , compass , magnetometer , altimeter , infrared sensor , visual or image sensor ( such as a camera or video camera ), photo sensor , motion detector , and the like . in various embodiments , the positional change may be caused by a human or a mechanical device . fig1 a - b and 12 illustrates exemplary methods for landing an uav , in accordance with some embodiments . as illustrated in fig1 a , an airborne uav 1102 with rotating rotor blades is caught by a hand of a human 1101 via a holding member 1104 of the uav . in some embodiments , the mere act of holding the holding member may cause the uav to decelerate or stop . in some other embodiments , an additional positional change of the uav is required besides holding of the uav . such an additional positional change may include a change in the orientation of the uav such as by tilting or turning the uav by a certain angle 1152 along a particular rotational axis . such rotational changes may be detected , for example , by an inertial sensor or a visual sensor 1105 of the uav . in some embodiments , the positional change may include a sudden acceleration or deceleration caused by external forces ( e . g ., human ). for example , while holding the uav , the person may suddenly fling the uav toward a certain direction causing a sudden acceleration of the uav . such acceleration or deceleration may be detected by an onboard sensor such an as an inertial sensor and used to trigger the deceleration of the uav . fig1 illustrates another example of positional change of the uav , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . as illustrated , the uav 1202 is not only held by a human 1201 via a holding member 1204 but also moved in a predetermined pattern 1206 such as in a substantially circular pattern , from side to side , in a figure “ 8 ” pattern , or in any other suitable pattern . the movement pattern may be detected by one or more sensors described herein such as inertial sensors , visual sensors , motion sensors and the like . in some embodiments , the combination of the detected external contact and the detected positional change triggers the slowing down or stopping of the rotor blades of the uav . in some embodiments , external signals may be used to trigger the landing of the uav in addition to or instead of the external contact and / or positional changes . such external signals may include visual signals , audio signals , gesture signals or a combination thereof . in one embodiment , a subject landing method involves the steps of : ( a ) detecting a visual signal generated by an operator of said uav ; and ( b ) in response to the detected positional change and / or the visual signal , generating a deceleration signal to said uav to bring said uav to a stop . for example , the methods discussed in connection with fig1 - 15 may be similarly used to land the uav . as illustrated in fig1 , a gesture 1310 may be detected by an onboard sensor 1305 and used to trigger the landing of the uav such as discussed herein . the gesture may be made by any body part such as by a hand , arm , head , facial features , eye , and the like . as illustrated by fig1 , a recognizable visual sign , symbol or pattern 1410 may be detected by the onboard sensor 1405 and used to trigger the landing of the uav . such predetermined visual sign , symbol or pattern may be of predetermined color , shape , dimension , size and the like . as illustrated in fig1 , light source 1510 may be detected by an onboard sensor 1505 and used to trigger the landing of the uav such as discussed herein . in various embodiments , the landing of the uav may be triggered by the external contact , positional change , external signal , any other sensing mechanisms or any combination thereof . for example , as illustrated in fig1 - 15 , the external signals are used in conjunction with detected external contact with the uav ( e . g ., the holding of the holding member 1304 , 1404 or 1504 of fig1 , 14 or 15 , respectively ) to cause the landing of the uav . as illustrated in fig1 - 12 , positional changes are used in conjunction with external contact to trigger the landing of the uav . in some other embodiments , positional changes may be used in combination with external signals to trigger the landing of the uav . in some other embodiments , external contact , positional changes and external signals may be used together to trigger the landing of the uav . in various embodiments , the sensors and the controllers may be located onboard and / or off - board the uav . for example , in an embodiment , both the sensors and the controllers are located onboard the uav . in another embodiment , both the sensors and the controllers can be located off - board the uav . in some embodiments , some sensors are located onboard the uav while the other sensors are located off - board the uav . in another embodiment , some controllers are located onboard the uav while the other controllers are located off - board the uav . the subject launching and decelerating methods can be implemented by a wide range of uavs . the subject uavs exhibit one or more unique features as described herein . in one embodiment , the present invention provides an unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ), comprising : ( a ) one or more rotor blades ; ( b ) a sensor configured to detect ( 1 ) a positional change of the uav , ( 2 ) a visual signal

onboard sensors may transmit sensor data to an onboard controller , which in turn provides the sensor data to the remote controller . in some other embodiments , some of the onboard sensors may transmit the sensor data directly to the remote control device 1720 . as discussed above , various aspects of the sensing and controlling functionalities may be implemented by onboard systems , off - board systems , or a combination thereof . fig1 illustrates exemplary components of a system 1800 used to implement the present invention , in accordance with an embodiment . as illustrated , the

, the carrier can include a frame assembly and an actuation assembly . the frame assembly can provide structural support to the payload . the frame assembly can include individual frame components , some of which can be movable relative to one another . the frame assembly and / or its individual components can be coupled to an actuation assembly that faciliates the movement of the frame assembly . the actuation assembly can include one or more actuators ( e . g ., motors ) that actuate movement of the individual frame components . the actuators can permit the movement of multiple frame components simultaneously , or may be configured to permit the movement of a single frame component one at a time . the movement of the frame components can produce a corresponding movement of the payload . for example , the actuation assembly can actuate a rotation of one or more frame components about one or more axes of rotation ( e . g ., roll axis , pitch axis , or yaw axis ). the rotation of the one or more frame components can cause a payload to rotate about one or more axes of rotation relative to the uav . alternatively or in combination , the actuation assembly can actuate a translation of one or more frame components along one or more axes of translation , and thereby produce a translation of the payload along one or more corresponding axes relative to the uav . the payload can be coupled to the uav via the carrier , either directly ( e . g ., directly contacting the uav ) or indirectly ( e . g ., not contacting the uav ). optionally , the payload can be mounted on the uav without requiring a carrier . the payload can be integrally formed with the carrier . alternatively , the payload can be releasably coupled to the carrier . in some embodiments , the

in some embodiments , the sensor provides sensor data for the target of the payload . alternatively or in combination , the payload can include one or more emitters for providing signals to one or more targets . any suitable emitter can be used , such as an illumination source or a sound source . in some embodiments , the payload includes one or more transceivers , such as for communication with a module remote from the uav . fig1 illustrates an example uav 100 that may be used to implement the present invention , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the unmanned aerial vehicle 100 can include a propulsion system having one or more rotors 102 . any number of rotors may be provided ( e . g ., one , two , three , four , five , six , or more ). the rotors may be configured to be rotatably coupled to respective rotor blades 101 . when in use , the rotors can cause the rotor blades to rotate around the rotation mast or shaft at the same or different speed thereby causing the uav to hover / maintain position , change orientation , and / or change location . the distance between shafts of opposite rotors can be any suitable length . for example , the length can be less than or equal to 2 m , or less than equal to 5 m . in some embodiments , the length can be within a range from 40 cm to 1 m , from 10 cm to 2 m , or from 5 cm to 5 m . in some embodiments , the uav may include a body 104 that may be used to house or carry various components of the uav such as electrical components . such components may be carried inside the body or on the outer surface of the body . examples of components carried by the body may include flight control units , processors , circuit boards , actuators such as motors , communication units , sensors and the like . in some embodiment , the body of the uav may have attached thereto one or more extension members 103 . the extension members may include a support member that is adapted to support , in whole or in part , weight of the uav when the uav is not airborne . for example , the support member may include a landing stand such as illustrated in fig1 . the landing stand may form a rectangular shape or a similarly shaped structure configured to withstand external forces exerted , for example , during landing . in some embodiments , the extension members 103 may be configured to be touched , grasped or otherwise contacted by an external object such as a human hand , a robotic arm , and the like . in some embodiments , such contact may be detected by the uav ( e . g ., via a touch sensor located on the extension member ). in response to the detected external contact , the uav may autonomously cause the deceleration of the uav . for example , detected external contact may be received by a controller of the uav that generates a decelerating signal to one or more actuators ( motors ) associated with the rotors thereby causing the rotors ( and hence associated rotor blades ) to slow down , stall and / or come to a complete stop . in various embodiments , the uav may carry onboard one or more sensors 105 and 106 . examples of the sensors may include but not limit to an inertial sensor , gps receiver , compass , magnetometer , altimeter , infrared sensor , visual or image sensor ( such as a camera or video camera ), photo sensor , audio sensor ( e . g ., microphone ), motion detector , touch sensor , pressure sensor , temperature sensor , magnet , and the like . in various embodiments , the onboard sensors may be located at any suitable locations on the uav . for example

the uav . the onboard sensors may be used for a variety of purposes . for example , the sensors may be used for surveillance , surveys , photography , search and rescue , remote sensing , sample collection , scientific research , and the like . in some embodiments , some of the sensors may be used to facilitate the launching and / or landing of the uav using techniques described herein . for example , the sensors ( e . g ., inertial sensor , gps receiver and / or visual sensor ) may be used to detect a positional change of the uav ( including translational or rotational changes such as change in location , velocity , acceleration , and / or orientation ). as another example , the sensors ( e . g ., visual sensor , audio sensor , or motion detector ) may be used to detect an external signal such as a visual signal , a voice command , a gesture or movement of an object such as a body part . such detected positional change and / or external signal may be used to by the uav as a signal to autonomously start launching the uav , for example , by causing the start and / or the acceleration of the rotors ( and hence the rotation of the rotor blades ) to generate the lift necessary to cause the uav to gain or maintain elevation . in some embodiments , the launching of the uav as described above may be based on input from one , two , three or more of the sensors discussed herein . as another example , the sensors ( e . g ., touch sensor , pressure sensor , photo sensor , motion sensor ) may be used to detect an external contact with the uav while the uav is airborne . based on the detected external contact , the uav may autonomously cause the deceleration of the rotors ( and the associated rotor blades ). for example , a controller of the uav may receive the detected external contact and generate one or more deceleration or stall signals to one or more actuators ( e . g ., motors ) causing the rotor blades to slow down or stop rotating . instead of or in addition to external contact , positional change and / or external signals ( audio / visual / movement ) such as discussed above may be detected by the uav and used as signals to engage in the autonomous landing as discussed herein . in some embodiments , some or all of the sensors discussed herein may be located off board . such sensors may be located in an environment where the uav operates . for example , the sensors may be mounted on or carried by interior walls of a room ( e . g ., when the uav operates indoor ), buildings , trees or other fixed structures ( e . g ., when the uav operates outdoors ), and / or movable objects . the movable object may include a vehicle , such as an aerial vehicle , a water vehicle , a ground vehicle , a space vehicle , or any combination thereof in some embodiments , the movable object can be a living subject , such as a human or an animal . as discussed above , a uav may be capable of engaging in automatic landing operations based on detected external contact with the uav . to facilitate such external contact , in some embodiments , the uav may be provided with a holding member or structure configured to be touched , grasped , or otherwise contacted by or engage with an external object . in some embodiments , such a holding member may include a structure that also provides other functionalities . for example , the landing leg 103 such as illustrated in fig1 can be configured to be graspable by a human or robotic hand . in other words , the landing leg is a holding member . at the same time , the landing leg 103 can also be used to support , in whole or in part , the weight of the uav on a surface when the uav . thus , the holding member can also be used for other purposes ( e . g ., landing support ). in other embodiments , the holding member may include a structure that is provided for the sole purpose of being contacted by an external object . in various embodiments , the holding members may include a handle , clasp , rod , rope , leg , stand , structural extension , cavity , hole , bump , magnet , hook , loop , or the like , or any combination thereof . fig2 - 6 illustrate some example uavs with such holding members , in accordance with some embodiments . in some embodiments , the size , shape and dimension of the holding members may be adapted to be held , grasped , gripped or touched by a human hand , a mechanical arm or hand , or any other suitable grasping or gripping device or structure . in some embodiments , a holding member may be located relative to the uav such that the holding member is held or touched by a hand or device , there is sufficient distance between the hand or device and the one or more rotor blades of the uav or any other part of the uav that may cause injury or damage to hand or device . in some embodiments , the holding members may include one or more sensors for detecting external contact . such sensors may include , for example , a touch sensor , temperature sensor , pressure sensor , photo sensor , visual sensor , or any combination thereof in some embodiments , some or all of such sensors may be embedded in the holding members , located on other portions of the uav , and / or off of the uav . the sensors may be configured to communicate with a controller of the uav using wired or wireless communication methods . fig2 illustrates another

rods may extend outward or radiate from the side of the body of the uav . the holding members of the uav may include the holding rods 206 and optionally the landing stands 203 . fig3 illustrates another example uav 300 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the uav 300 may be similar to the uavs 100 and 200 described in connection with fig1 - 2 . however , instead of

facilitate the automatic landing discussed herein . in some embodiments , the holding legs 303 may optionally function as landing legs for supporting the weight of the uav , in whole or in part , on a surface when the uav is not airborne . fig4 illustrates another example uav 400 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the uav 400 may be similar to the uav 300 described above

touch sensor , temperature sensor , pressure sensor , photo sensor , visual sensor , or any combination thereof . furthermore , the locations of the holding rods 406 relative to the uav may be different than those for the holding legs 304 . for example , the holding rods 406 may be located further apart and / or directly below each of the rotors of the uav whereas the holding legs 306 may be located closer apart and / or below the body of the uav . in some embodiments , the holding rods 406 may optionally function as landing legs for supporting the weight of the uav , in whole or in part , on a surface when the uav is not airborne . fig5 illustrates another example uav 500 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the uav 500 may be similar to the uav 400

bipod fashion . each of the holding rods 506 may include a sensor 507 for detecting external contact with the rod such as discussed above . in some embodiments , any suitable number of holding rods may be provided . for example , the uav may include one , two , three , four , five or more holding rods . fig6 illustrates another example uav 600 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present

that extends substantially perpendicularly from the body of the uav . the holding rod 606 may include a sensor 607 for detecting external contact with the rod such as discussed above . in various embodiments , a uav may have any combination of the holding members discussed herein or variations thereof . for example , in an embodiment , the uav may have three holding members , two extending from the side of the body of the uav such as illustrated in fig2 and one extending directly below the body such as illustrated in fig6 . fig7 illustrates another example of a uav of the present invention . uav 700 that may be used to implement the present invention , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the uav 700 is similar to the uav 300 described in connection with fig3 . however , as illustrated , the uav is also configured to carry a load . the load may include a payload 708 and a carrier 709 for the payload . the carrier can be integrally formed with the uav . alternatively , the carrier can be releasably coupled to the uav . the carrier can include a suitable mounting structure ( e . g ., a gimbal platform ) capable of stabilizing and / or directing the movement of the payload . in some embodiments , the carrier can be adapted to control the state of the payload ( e . g ., position and / or orientation ) relative to the uav . in some embodiments ,

"this invention provides a simple , fast , and reliable method for producing a membrane contactor comprising a plurality of hollow fiber membranes produced from polytetrafluoroethylene or other fluoropolymers employing a potting compound comprising of a perfluorinated or fluorinated thermoplastic to seal the ends of the hollow fibers and bind them into a solid mass . the invention further provides for the membrane contactor or filter module made by the inventive method . the hollow fiber membranes used in this invention are produced from polytetrafluoroethylene homo or copolymers , but the technique is applicable to any polymeric or inorganic hollow fiber membrane , and represents an excellent technique for potting ceramic hollow fiber membranes as it minimizes risk of breakage of the fragile fibers . the potting film that is used in this invention may be produced from any fluorinated or perfluorinated thermoplastic such as : pfa ( polytetrafluoroethylene perfluoropropyl vinyl ether ), fep ( perfluoroethylene propylene polymer ), mfa ( polytetrafluoroethylene perfluoro methyl vinyl ether ), pvdf ( polyvinylidene fluoride ), thv ( tetrafluoroethylene , hexafluoropropylene , vinylidene fluoride terpolymer ), efep ( ethylene perfluoroethylene propylene polymer ), ectfe ( ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene polymer ), etfe ( ethylene tetrafluoroethylene polymer ), or other fluorinated or perfluorinated thermoplastics . preferred compounds are efep and thv for lower temperature applications ( below 120 ° c . ), mfa and pvdf for applications up to 150 ° c ., and fep or pfa for applications up to 200 ° c . the potting film may be any of a variety of commercially available fluoropolymer or perfluropolymeric films manufactured from the resins listed above ( dewal industries , ajedium , are examples of commercial suppliers ) or may be extruded as a film via a melt extrusion and calendaring operation known to those practiced in the art or produced by compression molding granules , powder , or pellets into a thin film between two heated platens , or cast from a solution prepared from granules , powder , or pellets of the resins listed above . the preferred method is a film produced via extrusion and calendaring operation . the film is prepared to a thickness of between 0 . 01 mm and 2 . 5 mm , with the preferred thickness between 0 . 076 mm and 0 . 125 mm and is generally dependent on the spacing desired between the fibers and the diameter of the fibers . shown in fig1 , the construction of a two dimensional plane of fibers 10 is the starting point for the film potting method and this two dimensional plane of fibers is hereafter referred to as the web 5 . the web can be prepared via different techniques . a number of hollow fibers of a given diameter and porosity are placed in a substantially parallel arrangement by either securing individual fibers to a support frame , or by wrapping a single length of hollow fiber multiple times around a support frame or by any other such means as to generate a two dimensional plane of fibers held stationary and parallel to one another . the support frame may be one of any number of suitable types of designs , but generally consists of three or four sides lying in the same plane , approximating a rectangle where each of the opposite pairs of sides are substantially parallel to one another . as shown in fig2 , the pair of sides opposite to one another that serve as either the terminal points for the fibers or the ends over which the fiber is wrapped around are referred to collectively as the frame end elements 12 . the other side or pair of sides opposite to one another that are substantially parallel to the hollow fibers are referred to as the side elements of the frame 14 . it is preferred that the side element 14 or elements 14 are adjustable , allowing the frame end elements to be move apart from one another , enabling the frame to be used for multiple module lengths . it is also preferred that the end frame elements 12 are removable to allow either the spacing between the fibers to be adjustable or to adjust the width of the web being prepared . fig2 a and 2 b show two such types of end frame elements . while individual fibers may be arranged along the perimeter of a frame and secured , one embodiment as shown in fig3 is to wind a single hollow fiber 10 around the end frame elements 12 , creating two webs 5 of fibers , an upper web and a lower web , or one long web of double the length of the frame . the frame may be stationary and the fiber wrapped around the frame , or the frame may be rotated about an axis running parallel to the end frame elements 12 as the fiber is fed to the frame . the hollow fibers may be wound around a cylindrical mandrel , however , the use of the cylindrical mandrel is not as preferred as it inhibits the later weaving process and requires a different cylinder for each length of module desired . it is also preferred that the spacing between fibers is maintained at a distance approximately equal to or slightly greater than the thickness of the potting film being employed , allowing the assembler the ability to control the spacing between the fibers and hence control the spacing between fibers in the final module . the spacing may be controlled by utilizing a few different methods . one method to control the spacing is to use frame end elements , examples of which are shown in fig2 a and 2 b that have a series of parallel grooves 15 or slots perpendicular to the major axis of the frame end element . a second method is to use a series of circular disks of known thickness placed in between adjacent fibers . in lieu of circular discs a variety of fin or comb - like structures that allow the fibers to be indexed at uniform spacing along the length of the frame end element can also be used . it is generally desirable that the spacing be equal at the two opposite frame end elements to ensure equal spacing between the fibers in the completed potted assembly . a primer may be applied to further improve bonding between the potting film and the porous fiber . a dilute solution of the potting resin used to manufacture the potting film is prepared by dissolving either the film , pellets , granules , or powder forms of said potting resin in a suitable solvent . for a film produced from thv 220 may be suitably dissolved in acetone or methyl ethyl ketone . the percent solids in the solvent will be a function of the molecular weight of the polymer , but the solution should be suitably dilute to allow the film deposited to penetrate the pore structure of the fiber . a solution of 6 to 10 % solids by weight is suitable , but solutions more dilute , down to 1 % solids by weight are also acceptable and as high as 15 % solids by weight will work . as the solids level increases , the penetration into the pore structure decreases and the thickness of the dried primer on the outside of the fiber increases . the solution is brushed or wiped onto the fiber ends where the potting film is to be applied , ensuring coverage around the entire circumference of the fiber membrane , but only covering that portion which will eventually be covered by the potting film as the primer penetrates the pore structure of the membrane and will block pores . the primer is allowed to dry in air for a minimum of two hours at 20 ° c . to 30 ° c . while application of heat will accelerate the drying process , this is less preferable as there is risk of forming bubbles from the solvent being released too quickly . after the primer has dried , the fiber array is ready for application of the film for the next step in the potting process . whether or not a primer is employed , the next step in the film potting process is to begin applying strips of potting film to the ends of the fiber web . as shown in fig4 , typically a length of thin film 20 , preferably a fluoropolymer , is inserted between the fibers 10 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the major axis of the fibers at or near either of the frame end elements . fig5 shows an isometric view of the fibers with one strip of film woven between them . the film 20 is first fed over the top of the first fiber 10 and underneath the adjacent fiber 10 . this sequence repeating itself in such a way as to ensure that each fiber has at least one layer of the film between that fiber and each adjacent fiber until all the fibers have been separated from one another by one layer of film . the said thin film may be a single strip woven between the fibers , or , as shown in fig6 , may consist of two or more strips 20 of said film woven between the fibers in alternating directions next to one another , with the first strip passing over alternate fibers , the adjacent strip passing under those same alternate fibers , resulting in a longer potted portion of fiber . a second strip of film or set of film strips may then be woven in a similar manner at the opposite frame end element , depending on the type of module to be constructed . if the element is to be a cross flow element or a dead end filter element , both ends are fitted with the strips of film . if the web is to be unfolded to a double length , then no strips are applied at the opposite frame end element . following the insertion of one or more lengths of thin film alternating between the fibers , a length of thin film 22 is then placed perpendicularly to the major axis of the fiber as shown in fig7 , on top of the array of fibers and along the same axis as the strips of film previously woven between the fibers . this strip of film may be wider or narrower than the band of woven strips , but preferably is of the same width as the combined width of the woven strips and is referred to as a crossing film . the thickness of this first crossing film may be of variable thickness , chosen by the assembler to control the distance between the fibers as they are bundled . use of a crossing film is not necessary , but can help to ensure that the potted end is leak - free and also helps to control spacing between the fibers . the crossing film and the woven film are then heated at a temperature that is greater than 10 ° c . above the melting point of the polymer from which the film was made until the crossing film fuses with the woven film strip or strips . after bonding crossing strips to the woven strips at either or both ends of the frame , the frame may be flipped over and the process repeated on the reverse side at top and bottom , creating two identical webs ready for the last step prior to bundling . for a single web of double length , only one end on the reverse side is potted . after applying the weave strips and the crossing strips , the web is removed from the frame . if the web was prepared by wrapping a hollow fiber , the fibers are cut along the major axis of the frame end elements separating the fibers into two webs , one formed on the top of the winding rack , one on the bottom . if only one end of the top web and bottom web were prepared with the fluoropolymer films , then the web is opened up on itself to form a single web of a length double that of the winding frame . the single web or the two matching webs are then placed on a flat surface , with the face having the upper crossing film face down . a second crossing strip 24 is then placed along the woven strips , as shown in fig8 , parallel to the previously applied crossing strip , but on the opposite sides of the fibers . if the opposite ends of the fibers were fitted with film , then a second crossing tape is applied to that end as well . fig9 shows the completed web 5 of fibers 10 with woven film 20 and upper 22 and lower 24 crossing strips applied at both ends of the web . on completion of the individual web , it is carefully rolled up upon itself as shown as an end view in fig1 , allowing the ends of the fibers fitted with the strips of film to wind up in a spiral 30 . additional webs may then be wound onto the roll simply by abutting the end of one web with the beginning of the other , having trimmed any excess of the film from the ends of each . additional webs are applied until the final fiber count is achieved . the web may be wound up on itself or may be wrapped around a core piece to provide support or structure . the core piece may be a fluoropolymer rod or may be machined from stainless steel or other compatible metals or polymers . if one uses a metal core , it is important that the surface be roughened or pre - coated with a fluoropolymer that is compatible with the film used for potting to ensure good adhesion and no leakage between the fibers and the solid core piece . the potted fiber bundle is completed by a combination of applied heat and compression . radial compression of the taped end by heating and compressing means causes the fiber ends to translate radially toward the centerline of the cylindrical bundle , reducing the distance between adjacent fibers is until all interstitial volume between the fibers is eliminated and the fused tape contacts all outer surfaces of the membranes . this results in a leak proof potted end . the compression and applied heat are essential for establishing void - free , leak free high packing density potted ends . the radial compression may be achieved by any number of means , but several factors are important . the compression must be slow enough so as not to deform the hollow fibers and cause them to become closed off , and the compression should be done in a manner that maintains as true a right rectangular cylindrical shape to the potted end as possible . the end fitted with the strips of film is heated to a temperature at least 10 ° c . above the melting point of the film and allowed to reach equilibrium , the time required to reach equilibrium dictated by the size of the module . the compressing means may be by several methods all which achieve a gradual compression and maintain a cylindrical shape while being heated : including but not limited to : heat shrinkable sleeving , various collet systems , adjustable centerline roller systems , and an adjustable sleeving system . there are other methods of achieving the compression that would be obvious to those skilled in the art on understanding the function of the compression . achieving compression via a collet system as shown in fig1 consists of placing the rolled end 30 of the fibers fitted with the woven and crossing films in a collet system 31 of a diameter large enough to accommodate the rolled and uncompressed bundle whose closed diameter is equal to or less than the desired final compressed diameter of the fiber bundle . the collet assembly holding the bundle of fiber fitted with the potting films is placed in an oven or heated chamber and brought up to a temperature at least 10 ° c . above the melting point of the film used for potting . achieving the compression via an adjustable sleeving system as shown in fig1 is achieved by placing a suitable band 35 of tempered steel around the rolled bundle 30 . the band consists of a strip of metal that has preferably been coated with ptfe or similar release agent . the width of the band should be no wider than the length of the potted region of the fibers . the band should overlap on itself by at least 5 % and preferably about 25 % to maintain a uniform circle and so when radially compressed via a circular clamp 23 , the end of the band slides over top of itself and reduces in diameter in proportion to the tightening of the outer band clamp . the thickness of the tempered steel is between 0 . 1 mm to 0 . 127 mm , but may be as thin as 0 . 0254 mm for smaller bundles and as thick as 0 . 05 mm for larger diameter bundles . the fiber bundle is compressed until the desired final diameter is achieved and all the voids between the fibers have been eliminated . the final diameter may be simply where all the voids are eliminated but may be reduced more by further tightening of the bundle . the compressed potted end is removed from the heat source and allowed to cool at which time the compression means is removed from the potted end . depending on the number of fibers , the diameter of the fibers , the softness of the fibers , and the final diameter desired in the bundle , the compression means may be achieved in a single step or multiple applications . for larger bundles , generally exceeding 50 to 80 mm in diameter , benefit from multiple applications of the compression means during build - up of the fibers . fig1 shows an end view of the potted fibers 10 in the solid mass of potting compound 35 . for a cross flow module , the final bundled assembly has two potted ends 40 , each of which resembles the potted cross section shown in fig1 . fig1 shows a drawing of such a potted bundle . to achieve a similar configuration for a dead - end or single potted end , one prepared end of the web 5 is flipped over on itself ( fig1 ) while holding the other end stationary , resulting in the web 5 being twisted along the plane of the web with the result that the top strip 22 at one end of the web no longer lies in the same plane as the top strip 22 on the other end of the web . the web is then rolled and compressed in a manner similar to that previously outlined resulting in a potted bundle with looped fibers 10 shown in fig1 . to properly validate the integrity of the potted end , there is a need for a test that shows no leakage around the fibers between the fiber wall and the potting compound at elevated pressures . a method common to those practiced in the art was employed which involves the determination of the bubble point of the fiber using isopropyl alcohol . the bubble point method includes a number of steps . in the first step the fiber is wetted in isopropyl alcohol ( ipa ) and pressurized to ensure there is no trapped air in the pores of the fiber . the fiber is then looped and immersed in a clear container of ipa with the two lumen ends above the level of the ipa . air pressure is applied to the lumen ends in small increments until the first bubble of air is observed on the outside of the fibers . the resulting pressure is the bubble point pressure and is an indication of the largest pore in the fiber as the ipa in that pore is the most readily ( lowest pressure ) displaced by the incoming air pressure . the integrity of a potted end may be tested by sealing the potted end in a dear tube of plastic or glass and immersing the pendant hollow fibers in ipa . air pressure is applied to the open lumen ends of the hollow fibers and the potted end is observed as well as observing the first appearance of a bubble on the fiber walls . if no bubbles appear at the wetted face of the potted end and the bubble point pressure matches that of the single fiber , the integrity of the potted seal has been shown . to test the strength of the bond between the fiber and the potted assembly , a pull test has been developed that measures the force required to extract a single fiber from the potted end of the bundle ( or break the fiber attempting extraction ). the test consists of using a chatillon force gauge on an individual fiber from one of the potted ends of the bundle . the bundle is placed under the slotted support bracket to hold it in place . an individual fiber is randomly selected , placed through the slotted support bracket , and tied to a “ j ” hook attached to the top of the force gauge . the force gauge is activated and extends upward pulling on the individual fiber to achieve separation from the potted bundle or breaking of the individual fiber , whichever comes first . once the end point is reached , the machine automatically stops and displays the break force value in newtons . twenty hollow fibers with an outer diameter of 1 . 5 mm and an inner diameter of 1 . 0 mm and a porosity of 55 % were potted using an epoxy potting compound formulated by henkel corporation ( loctite ®) for use with fluoropolymer resins . two samples were prepared , with the fibers for the first sample left untreated while the fibers for the second sample were treated with a corona discharge to promote adhesion with the epoxy . the corona discharge consisted of five second exposures four times followed by rotation of the fiber by 90 ° and repeating the treatment until the fiber had been rotated 360 °. the epoxy was loctite product x263572 , developed expressly for use with fluoropolymers and other low surface energy polymers . approximately 350 grams of resin were mixed with 122 grams of hardener . a fixture was made to suspend the fibers in a 100 ml beaker so that they did not touch the sides or the bottom of the beaker . the fibers were looped over the top of a rod so that the ends of the fibers were suspended in the resin . the epoxy was cured for 10 hours at 22 ° c . followed by 2 hours at 65 ° c . and 2 hours at 120 ° c . to achieve a complete cure . following cooling to room temperature for 4 hours , the beakers were removed and the bottom 2 - cm was cut off from each potted end . the ends were polished to achieve a clean finish on the potted ends . the adhesion between the fiber and the potting resin was tested using a chatillon force gauge attached to an individual fiber and pulled to failure . in each case the failure mode was the fiber pulling free of the epoxy . for the untreated fiber , the average pull force required to pull out the fiber was 3 . 37 lbf or 15 newtons . the treated fibers had an average pullout force of 7 . 53 lbf or 33 . 5 newtons . in this example , the film potting method is used to make a cross flow module consisting of 110 hollow fibers potted at both ends of the bundle . 110 loops of a hollow fiber membrane prepared from polytetrafluoroethylene with an inner diameter of 1 . 5 mm and an outer diameter of 1 . 9 mm with a porosity of 40 % were wrapped around a winding frame 400 mm from end to end and 250 mm wide . the winding frame was fitted with slotted rods at each end , with spacing between slots of 2 . 0 mm , ensuring spacing between the hollow fibers of 0 . 1 mm . a potting film pre pared from ethylene fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer ( efep , daikin rp 4020 ) with a thickness of 0 . 0762 mm , a width of 25 . 4 mm , and a length of 220 millimeters was woven between each individual fiber at the end of the winding frame . the film was passed underneath the first fiber on the frame and then alternately passed over the top of the next fiber and underneath the following fiber . this pattern was repeated until the film was passed between each fiber on the winding rack . the excess tape was trimmed off . a second strip of tape of similar size was placed on top of the hollow fibers ( referred to as the top tape ), directly above the woven strip . the end of the winding rack containing the tape was heated above its melting point of 160 ° c . by means of a forced air heat gun set at 450 ° c . for 45 seconds . the potting tapes melted sufficiently to attach to each other and to the hollow fibers . the weaving process was repeated at the other end of the winding rack , followed by application of a top layer of film heated and bonded to the fibers and the woven film . the process was again repeated on the two ends on the back side of the winding rack . the fibers were removed from the winding rack by cutting the fibers along the major axis of the slotted ends containing the tape , forming two webs of fibers bound by the potting tape . each woven web containing 110 fibers was laid on a flat surface with the side fitted with the top tape facing downward . a third piece of potting film of similar dimensions ( bottom film ) was placed over the hollow fibers directly above the other two films and heated in a similar manner , bonding the two strips of film to one another and to the hollow fiber . the first web was subsequently wound into a tight cylinder , being careful that the ends remained parallel and that the diameters of each end were identical . the second web was subsequently added to the end of the first web and continued to be wrapped , resulting in a final diameter of approximately 38 mm in diameter . to compress the bundle ends and occlude any voids , each taped end was fitted with a sleeve of a fluoropolymer heat shrink with an inner diameter of 38 mm ( fep 160 dupont , 1 . 3 : 1 expansion ratio ) approximately 25 mm long . each taped end was then placed in an oven at 232 ° c . for 30 minutes . the heat shrink tubing reduced in diameter , compressing the bundle of fibers into a contiguous mass . the resulting mass was allowed to cool for 30 minutes . the fluoropolymer heat shrink was then cut from the potted end . the potted bundle final diameter was 32 mm with a packing density of 78 %. examination of the potted ends via optical microscopy revealed no voids in the potted ends and good contact between the efep potting resin and the fibers . the resulting module was pressure tested by using the method outlined above and found to be fluid tight . subsequent testing of the individual fibers showed a pull strength of greater 75 newtons , with the fiber failing before the bond with the potting . in this example , the film potting method is used to produce a dead - end filter module . a continuous length of porous ptfe hollow fiber with the dimensions of 1 . 0 mm inner diameter and 1 . 5 mm outer diameter , with a specific gravity of 0 . 9 grams / cm 3 was employed for this module . using the winding apparatus previously described in example 1 , the fiber was wound between the two end pieces 120 times to create two 120 - fiber webs on the top and bottom of the winding frame . the spacing between the fibers was maintained by machined grooves in the end pieces of the winding frame . the spacing between the fibers was set at 1 . 6 mm . the spacing between the two end elements of the frame was 610 mm . this process was repeated several times to generate sufficient fibers to make the unit . a strip of 0 . 051 mm thick thv - 220g film ( dyneon ) with a width of 50 mm was woven in between the porous hollow fibers following previously described methodology at the two ends of the winding frame . after weaving one strip of film at each end of the winding frame , another strip of film of identical dimensions was placed directly over the top of the fibers . using an industrial heat gun set at 450 ° c ., hot air was passed over the film for approximately 30 seconds . the film was fused to the individual fibers as well as to the underlying film . this process was repeated on the opposite end of the frame . the frame was rotated to expose the opposing side and a second strip was applied over the woven strips at both ends of the frame as described above . the fibers are then cut along the length of the two end pieces creating two individual webs of 100 fibers each that were approximately 610 mm long . both webs were laid out on a flat surface with the sides without the 2 nd strip of film facing downward . a third piece of film was then bonded in a similar fashion on top of the woven film on both ends of the web , creating two 120 fiber webs with each end secured by a top film , a bottom film , and a woven film . to prepare the dead - end filter , a section of a web containing 16 fibers was cut from a larger web . while holding the web on both ends , one end was rotated 180 °. the web was then folded in half , laying the taped ends on top of one another . by this action the exit lumen of one fiber at the start of the web is placed adjacent to the entrance lumen of the furthest most fiber on the other side of the web . the web is rolled up at the taped ends to create a tight cylinder . to compress the bundle into a solid mass , a 50 mm length of 12 mm id fep ( 1 . 3 to 1 ratio ) heat shrinkable sleeve was subsequently placed over the bundled end placed into a tunnel heater at 218 ° c . for fifteen minutes . the bundle was removed and allowed to cool at room temperature for approximately 20 minutes . the heat shrink sleeve was carefully scored and removed from the bundled end . another small web consisting of thirty - one fibers was twisted and folded in the same fashion as the first web and rolled around the original bundle . a 50 mm length of 38 mm id fep ( 1 . 6 to 1 ratio ) heat shrink sleeving was placed over the bundle and heated at 218 ° c . for fifteen minutes . the bundle was removed and allowed to cool at room temperature for approximately twenty minutes , followed by removal of the fep heat shrink sleeve . the process of preparing and folding web sections was repeated using webs of 63 fibers , 70 fibers , 80 fibers , 123 fibers , 50 fibers , each followed by compression with the appropriately sized fep heat shrink and heating in the oven . the final bundling process involves wrapping a 2 , 750 mm × 5 mm wide strip of 0 . 127 mm thv 500g film / tape around the bundle and then placing a 5 mm long piece of 76 mm diameter fep heat shrink sleeving over the tape and heat at 232 ° c . for thirty minutes . the bundle is removed from the oven and allowed to cool for forty - five minutes . following removal of the heat shrink sleeve , the final step in the method can consist of trimming off 25 mm of the potted end for a fresh clean finished bundle , exposing the open lumen ends . this finished “ dead - end ” cartridge produces an outside diameter of 67 mm , containing 433 individual fibers with 886 open lumen ends with an active filtration length of 250 mm . pull strength of individual fibers were measured as described and averaged 70 n . in this example , the film potting method is used to produce a double ended cross flow module using double weaves . 200 loops of a hollow fiber membrane prepared from polytetrafluoroethylene with an inner diameter of 1 . 5 mm and an outer diameter of 1 . 9 mm with a porosity of 65 % were wrapped around a winding frame 1000 mm from end to end and 400 mm wide , fitted with slotted rods at each end , with spacing between slots of 2 . 0 mm , ensuring spacing between the hollow fibers of 0 . 1 mm . a potting tape prepared from dyneon thv - 220 with a thickness of 0 . 0762 mm , a width of 25 . 4 mm , and a length of 600 millimeters ( referred to as the weave tape ) was woven between each individual fiber at the end of the winding frame starting by passing under the first fiber , over the adjacent fiber , and continuing across the frame , resulting in a strip of potting film being interlaced between the fibers . the excess tape was trimmed off . after completing the initial weaving step , a second piece of the thv 220 film of similar dimensions was woven next to the first piece of thv tape , reversing the weaving pattern from the first film . the second piece of film was woven by first passing the film over the first fiber , under the second fiber , and on until the second strip has been woven between all the fibers . this weaving process was repeated at the opposite end of the frame . a strip of film that is double the width of the individual weaving strips but of the same length was placed on top of the hollow fibers ( referred to as the top tape ), directly above the woven strip . the end of the winding rack containing the tape was heated so that the film was brought above its melting point of 160 ° c . by means of a forced air heat gun set at 450 ° c . for 60 seconds . the potting tapes melted sufficiently to attach to each other and to the hollow fibers . this process was repeated at the other end of the winding rack . the process was again repeated on the two ends on the back side of the winding rack . the fibers were cut at the ends of the winding frame to create two individual webs of fiber . each web was placed on a flat surface with the top strip facing downwards and another strip of film applied across the woven strips and bonded in a similar fashion to the first side . on completion of applying the potting film , the web is rolled up on itself . after rolling the 200 fiber web a diameter of approximately 46 mm was achieved . a 50 mm long piece of 38 mm ( 1 . 3 / 1 ) fep heat shrink and slide over each end of the bundle . each potted end is placed in an oven at 233 ° c . for a period of 30 minutes to achieve a finished diameter of approximately 39 mm after removing the fep heat shrink . the bundle was removed from the oven and allowed to cool for 30 minutes . once cooled , the fep heat shrink was removed and the second 200 fiber web was rolled onto the compressed bundle resulting in a diameter of approximately 56 mm . another 50 mm long piece of 60 mm fep heat shrink was placed over each end of the bundle and placed in an oven at 232 ° c . for a period of 30 minutes to achieve a finished diameter of 51 mm . the bundle was removed from the oven and allowed to cool for 30 minutes . the fep heat shrink was removed and approximately 25 mm was trimmed off of each bundled end resulting in a clean flush cut with open lumen ends . the average pull - out strength was measured at 68 newtons . in this example the tape potting method utilizing a spring steel compression is used to produce a dead - end filter module . 200 loops of a hollow fiber membrane prepared from polytetrafluoroethylene with an inner diameter of 1 . 0 mm and an outer diameter of 1 . 4 mm with a porosity of 43 % were wrapped around a winding frame equipped with slotted ends spaced at 1 . 5 millimeters , ensuring spacing between the hollow fibers of 0 . 1 mm . a potting film prepared from dyneon thv - 220 with a thickness of 0 . 0762 mm , a width of 25 mm , and a length of 400 mm was woven between each individual fiber at the end of the winding frame resulting in a pattern wherein the tape was alternately passed over the top of one fiber and underneath the adjacent fiber . a strip of film of similar size was placed underneath the hollow fibers , directly beneath the woven strip . a third strip of film was placed above the woven strip . the end of the winding rack containing the film was heated via a hot air gun set at 450 ° c . for 45 seconds . the potting films melted sufficiently to attach to each other and to the hollow fibers . the fibers were removed from the winding rack by cutting the fibers along the major axis of the slotted end containing the film . one end of the hollow fiber membrane web was then folded over on itself resulting in a 180 degree twist in the web . the two taped ends were laid on top of one another . the entire taped web was subsequently wound into a tight cylinder with the taped fiber ends wrapping up on themselves . to achieve compression , the taped end was fitted with a sleeve of spring steel ( 0 . 178 mm 1095 grade tempered spring steel ) approximately 130 mm long by 5 mm wide . the sleeve of spring steel was in turn fastened with two hose clamps to allow compression of the spring steel . each taped end was then placed in an oven at 232 ° c . degrees for 30 minutes . following 15 minutes of heating , the bundle was removed and the hose clamps tightened , resulting in a 10 % reduction in the spring steel sleeve diameter , compressing the bundle of fibers and molten tape into a contiguous mass . the process was continued 2 times . the resulting mass was allowed to cool for 30 minutes . the potted bundle final diameter was 35 mm with a packing density of 78 % in a dead end configuration . the resulting module was pressure tested by observing the bubble point of the hollow fibers as outlined above and it was found to have a fluid tight seal . subsequent testing of the individual fibers showed an average puff strength of 71 newtons . the following example illustrates the use of a primer solution of the potting resin to promote adhesion between the potting film and the porous ptfe hollow fibers being assembled into a module . 110 loops of a hollow fiber membrane prepared from polytetrafluoroethylene with an inner diameter of 1 . 5 mm and an outer diameter of 1 . 9 mm with a porosity of 65 % were wrapped around a winding frame 400 mm from end to end and 250 mm wide , fitted with slotted rods at each end , with spacing between slots of 2 . 0 mm , ensuring spacing between the hollow fibers of 0 . 1 mm . after the fibers are secured to the winding rack , the ends of the individual fibers are pretreated with a solution of the potting resin , in this example a solution of dyneon thv 220 prepared by dissolving 3 grams of thv 220 per 40 ml of acetone . using a synthetic bristle brush , a thin layer of the thv 220 solution is applied to both ends of each fiber , ensuring that the full circumference of each fiber was coated . the coating was applied from the end of each fiber in a distance equivalent to that of the potting film , in this case 25 mm . following application of the primer coating , the thv solution was allowed to dry at room temperature for 120 minutes . after drying a second layer of the thv solution was applied to the fibers . the second coating was allowed to dry at room temperature for an additional 120 minutes . a potting tape pre pared from dyneon thv - 220 with a thickness of 0 . 0762 mm , a width of 25 . 4 mm , and a length of 600 millimeters ( referred to as the weave tape ) was woven between each individual fiber at the end of the winding frame starting by passing under the first fiber , over the adjacent fiber , and continuing across the frame , resulting in a strip of potting film being interlaced between the fibers . the excess tape was trimmed off . after completing the initial weaving step , a second piece of the thv 220 film of similar dimensions was woven next to the first piece of thv tape , reversing the weaving pattern from the first film , that is , passing over the first fiber , under the second fiber , and on until the second strip has been woven between all the fibers . this weaving process was repeated at the opposite end of the frame . a strip of film that is double the width of the individual weaving strips but of the same length was placed on top of the hollow fibers ( referred to as the top tape ), directly above the woven strip . the end of the winding rack containing the tape was heated above its melting point of 160 ° c . by means of a forced air heat gun set at 450 ° c . for 60 seconds . the potting tapes melted sufficiently to attach to each other and to the hollow fibers . this process was repeated at the other end of the winding rack . the process was again repeated on the two ends on the back side of the winding rack . the fibers were cut at the ends of the winding frame to create two individual webs of fiber . each web was placed on a flat surface with the top strip facing downwards and another strip of film applied across the woven strips and bonded in a similar fashion to the first side . on completion of applying the potting film , the web is rolled up on itself . after rolling the 110 fiber web a diameter of approximately 35 mm is achieved . a 127 mm piece of 0 . 178 mm thick 1095 tempered spring steel was wrapped around each end of the bundle and secured with two standard hose clamps . the potted ends were placed in an oven at 233 ° c . for a period of 30 minutes . the bundle was removed and the hose clamps were tightened approximately 9 times to achieve an outside diameter of approximately 26 . 5mm or 25 % of the original starting diameter . the potted ends were allowed to cool for approximately 30 minutes and the clamps and tempered spring steel strip was removed . approximately 25 mm was trimmed off each potted end resulting in a clean flush cut with open lumen ends . an average pull strength of 81 newtons was measured . it should be noted that throughout this patent application , for the sake of brevity , we use the term x / y to represent a copolymer of x and y , and the term x / y / z to represent a terpolymer of x and y and z .",1

s end effector . as shown in the fig1 , the view state can be defined as a vector : here , ( x w , y w ) is the view position . the view orientation ( γ , φ ) is composed of the azimuth angle γ and the zenith angle φ . the world coordinate frame o w x w y w z w and the local coordinate frame o v x v y v z v are defined , as shown in fig1 . in the world coordinate frame , the x w y w plane is located at the object plane of the system . the local coordinate frame o v x v y v z v is fixed on the observed target . the azimuth angle γ and zenith angle φ are defined with respect to the local coordinate frame o v x v y v z v . in korean patent application no . 10 - 0839871 , the rotation angle of the scanning mirror 21 and view angle are coupled as shown in fig2 . the zenith angle decrease in order to observe the object in the center of the object plane . to decouple the rotation angle of the scanning mirror and view angles , a telecentric scanner is designed and introduced to the system , which includes a two axis scanning mirror 21 and a telecentric lens group 20 . the system layout is shown in fig3 . the view position can be steered by the telecentric scanner . the view direction can be steered by double wedge prisms 10 and 11 . a first intermediate image is formed by a first imaging optical element 31 . optical elements 32 and 33 integrate a deformable mirror 40 into the system . the deformable mirror 40 is used for correction of aberration induced by the wedge prisms . the optical elements 34 and 33 relay the active aperture of the deformable mirror to the system aperture . a final imaging optical element 35 forms a final image on the image sensor 60 . the concept of the telecentric system is shown in fig4 , where the telecentric lens group is simplified as a lens 20 . a stop 70 is located at the focal point of the telecentric lens . it makes an entrance pupil infinitely . therefore in the object side , the chief rays are always parallel to the optical axis . when the telecentric lens is integrated to the system , the scanning mirror is located at the focal point of the telecentric lens . the azimuth angle and zenith angle of view are only related to the rotation angle of the prisms . the telecentric scanner is designed separately from the whole system . a preliminary design for the experiment setup is shown in fig5 . diffraction limit is achieved in the design . a two axis scanner includes an x axis scanning mirror 210 and a y axis scanning mirror 211 . a telecentric lens group consists of two lenses , a plano - convex lens 200 and an achromatic doublet lens 201 . the maximum peak - valley wavefront error of the whole system including wedge prisms is less than 2 . 6 λ ( λ = 660 nm ). the zenith and azimuth variation with the change of the scanning mirror angle when θ p1 = θ p2 =− 90 ° is shown in fig6 ( a ) and ( b ). as can be seen , the zenith angle φ equals 18 . 9 °. the azimuth angle γ equals 90 °. the motion of the scanning mirror and view orientation are decoupled . and a larger zenith angle is achieved . during the operation of the system , the angle of wedge prism and scanning mirror can be determined based on the kinematics and jacobian matrix of the system . the kinematics of the system can be defined as : where ( x w , y w , φ , λ ) is the vector for work space variables . the position ( x s , y s ) of ray after the telecentric lens group can be defined by the following equations : x s = d tan ( θ sx )/ cos ( θ sy )+ a tan ( θ sx ) where d is the distance between the principal plane of the telecentric lens group and the y scanning mirror 211 . a is the distance between the two mirrors . the configuration of two mirror scanning system is shown in fig7 . the ray tracing of the wedge prisms is shown in fig8 . by applying ray tracing through each surface , the final azimuth angle γ , zenith angle φ , and the view position ( x w , y w ) can be determined by the following equations : φ = cos − 1 ( x 5 ( 3 )); γ = π − a tan 2 ( x 5 ( 1 ), x 5 ( 2 )); where x 5 is the vector of ray between the last surface of the second wedge prism 11 and the object plane . e 5 is the cross point between x 5 and the object plane . in actual operation of the system , determination of joint variables given the position and orientation of view is more important . the relationship between the joint space and working space is nonlinear and complex . an analytical inverse relationship is difficult to obtain . therefore a numerical solution to inverse kinematics is applied in the present invention . the jacobian of the system can be divided to four parts as shown as follows : because of the decoupled design , the inverse jacobian can be expressed as : ( 1 ) desired working space variable is set as v d =[ x w , d y w , d γ d φ d ]′. ( 2 ) initial joint variables are p 0 =[ x s y s θ p1 θ p2 ] t 0 . where λ r and λ t are the gain factors . δ is the damping factor . δ = δ 0 ( 1 − ω / ω 0 ) 2 , if ω & lt ; ω 0 ; otherwise , δ = 0 , where ω =√{ square root over ( det ( jj t ))}. ( 5 ) if v d − f ( p i + 1 )& lt ; ε , then p i is the result , else go to ( 3 ). although the integration of active components in the present invention can achieve new functions , it also introduces aberrations that can degrade the quality of the image . in the present invention , a deformable mirror device 40 is applied to correct the aberration . instead of using a wavefront sensor , the system calculates the focus measure of the image captured from the camera . the control system uses focus measure as metric to represent the aberration of the image . the control signal is generated to change the surface of the deformable mirror iteratively during operation . as can be seen , because no wavefront sensor or laser source is used , the present invention becomes simple and robust to different kind of targets . the control diagram is shown in fig9 . in order to compare the present invention with the earlier approach with the coupled design , one simulation result is shown in fig1 . both systems apply double wedge prisms with 18 ° 8 ′ vertex angle . in the initial state , the top view of micro gear can be achieved from both systems . fig1 ( a ) shows the top view of a micro gear . because of self - occlusion , the hole in the gear cannot be observed . in order to observe the hole in the gear , a view with maximum zenith angle needs to be achieved . the current system can change the zenith angle φ up to 18 . 9 °. the captured image is shown in fig1 ( b ), where the hole in the gear can be observed . however , the earlier approach with the coupled design can only achieve the zenith angle φ up to 13 . 8 °. the captured image is shown in fig1 ( c ). as can be seen , a larger area of interest is achieved in the present system . the ability of the present invention to change the view without moving the object was tested using multi views of a micro chip . the top view of the micro chip is shown in fig1 ( a ), when θ sx = 0 °, θ sy =− 0 . 37 °, θ r1 = 180 ° and θ r2 = 0 °. the zenith angle φ is 0 . 43 °. the side of the chip cannot be observed due to self - occlusion . using a conventional optical system , it is difficult to observe every side of an object . however , in the present invention , by changing the configuration of the prisms and the scanning mirror , images with a different zenith angle φ and azimuth angle γ can be achieved . fig1 ( b ) shows the view with a zenith angle φ = 18 . 9 ° and an azimuth angle γ = 0 ° when θ sx =− 1 . 16 °, θ sy = 0 °, θ r1 = 90 ° and θ r2 = 90 °. the left side of the chip and the solder joint can be observed . fig1 ( c ) shows the view with a zenith angle φ = 18 . 9 ° and an azimuth angle γ = 90 ° when θ sx = 0 °, θ sy = 1 . 28 °, θ r1 = 0 ° and θ r2 = 0 °. fig1 ( d ) shows the view with a zenith angle φ = 18 . 9 ° and an azimuth angle γ = 270 ° when θ sx = 1 . 16 °, θ sy = 0 °, θ r1 =− 90 ° and θ r2 =− 90 °. fig1 ( e ) shows the view with a zenith angle φ = 18 . 9 ° and an azimuth angle γ = 270 ° when θ sx = 0 °, θ sy =− 1 . 28 °, θ r1 =− 180 ° and θ r2 =− 180 °. the dash lines indicate that every side of the chip can be observed with a different configuration of the wedge prisms and the scanning mirror . as can be seen , the present invention can obtain more vision information compared to a conventional optical system . as the scanning mirror also changes the zenith angle , the maximal zenith angle is different at different view positions . a microassembly application is shown in fig1 . the micro shaft needs to be inserted into the hole of the micro gear as shown in fig1 ( a ). fig1 ( b ) shows the top view of the micro gear and micro shaft . from the top view , the micro shaft can be moved near the micro gear first as shown in fig1 ( c ). however , it is impossible to make an insertion without information about the hole in the gear . with the present invention , the system can change the zenith angle and azimuth angle of view to 18 . 9 ° and − 90 °. the captured image in this configuration is shown in fig1 ( d ). then , the micro shaft can be aligned with the hole as shown in fig1 ( e ). the present system has a simple kinematics . the inverse kinematics is easy to get a solution , which is important for automation of the system . the zenith angle of view can achieve a large value compared to the previous system , which can provide more vision information when occlusion happens . while the exemplary embodiments have been shown and described , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure as defined by the appended claims . in addition , many modifications can be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of this disclosure without departing from the essential scope thereof . therefore , it is intended that this disclosure not be limited to the particular exemplary embodiments disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure , but that this disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims .",6

and nuts . the mattress support component 500 of the bed enclosure 1 , shown in fig3 and 4 , is suitably adapted to support a bed mattress 5 . the mattress support component 500 may be constructed of any suitable rigid material , such as metal or rigid plastic . in the preferred embodiment it is constructed of wood , specifically dimensioned lumber . in one embodiment the mattress support component 500 is comprised of lateral members 510 , 530 , 540 secured in a substantially horizontal orientation to the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 on the interior portions of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , and a mattress support surface 550 which is placed onto the lateral members 510 , 530 , 540 . in the preferred embodiment the lateral members 510 , 530 , 540 each are substantially elongate and substantially planer and have a substantially uniform thicknesses and atop edge 518 , 538 , 548 . see fig3 . there is a head support member 510 , a foot support member , a first side support member 530 , and a second side support member 540 . the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members lie substantially within a single horizontal plane . the mattress support surface 550 is substantially planar and has a width just slightly less than the length of the lower horizontal support member 140 of the head subframe 100 . it is placed onto at least a portion of the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of at least two of the lateral support members , for example onto the top edge 538 of the first side support member 530 and the top edge 548 of the second side support member 540 . in other embodiments there may be multiple mattress support surfaces 550 , placed on the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of lateral support members and lying within a single substantially horizontal plane . the use of multiple mattress support surfaces 550 allows each to be smaller and thus easier to manipulate . in the preferred embodiment each of the plurality of mattress support components 500 extends from the top edge 538 of the first side support member 530 to the top edge 548 of the second side support member 540 . the mattress support component 500 may further comprise at least one cross piece 560 , with each cross piece 560 being substantially elongate and substantially planer and having a substantially uniform thickness , a top edge 568 , a first end , and a second end . see fig3 . each cross piece 560 is secured between the first side subframe 300 and the second side subframe 400 and with its top edge 568 oriented upwards and in a plane with the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members . the first end of each cross piece 560 is secured to the first side support member 530 . similarly , the second end of each cross piece 560 is secured to the second side support member 540 . each cross piece 560 is oriented substantially parallel to the head support member 510 . the mattress support surface 550 is placed onto at least a portion of the top edge 568 of at least one cross piece 560 . when the mattress support component 500 is configured with one or more cross pieces 560 the mattress support surface 550 is better supported from below , strengthening the bed enclosure 1 . in another embodiment there may be a plurality of lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 secured to each lower horizontal support member 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 . this permits the use of shorter lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 and allows for gaps between the lateral support members located on a given lower horizontal support member , to accommodate the ends of the cross pieces 560 . in this configuration the first end of each cross piece 560 is secured directly to the lower horizontal support member 340 of the first side subframe 300 between adjacent first side support members 530 , and the second end of each cross piece 560 is secured directly to the lower horizontal support member 440 of the second side subframe 400 between adjacent second side support members 540 . in the preferred embodiment the lateral support members are positioned relative to the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 such that the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members are positioned below the top edges 148 , 248 , 348 , 448 of the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 . see fig4 , 4 a , and 4 b . the height of the portions of the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 which extend above the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 is less than the thickness of the bed mattress 5 . this configuration addresses the problem of “ burrowing ”, in which a user of the bed enclosure 1 either intentionally or inadvertently places a portion of his or her body between the side of the bed mattress 5 and a side wall . this could occur when the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members are positioned in substantially the same plane as the top edges 148 , 248 , 348 , 448 of the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 of the subframes 100 , 200 300 400 , such that the sides of the bed mattress 5 are proximate to the flexible sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 . an application of force to the region of proximity between the side of the bed mattress 5 and a sidewall may cause a space to open there between , potentially entrapping a body part and leading to serious harm to the user . with the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 configured as described , a substantial portion of the bed mattress 5 lies below the top edges 148 , 248 , 348 , 448 of the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 so that the lower portions of the sides of the bed mattress 5 are proximate to a rigid structure , thereby minimizing the amount of space that can be opened between the sides of the bed mattress 5 and the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 . having the height of the portions of the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 which extend above the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 less than the thickness of a bed mattress 5 allows the top portion of the sides of the bed mattress 5 to extend above the rigid structure , reducing the possibility of contact by the user with a hard surface . see fig4 a . in the most preferred embodiment the height of the portions of the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 which extend above the top edges 518 , 538 , 548 of the lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 should be just slightly less than the thickness of the bed mattress 5 when the bed mattress 5 is fully compressed . the above - described elements of the mattress support component 500 may be fixedly secured to the subframes or removably secured to the subframes . in one embodiment the mattress support component 500 is removably secured to the subframes by a plurality of bottom fasteners 740 placed within bottom apertures 720 formed into and through the lateral support members and the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 . see fig4 c . bottom apertures 720 are disposed along the lower horizontal support member 140 of the head subframe 100 and along the head support member 510 such that the bottom apertures 720 of the head subframe 100 align with the bottom apertures 720 of the head support member 510 . in a like manner bottom apertures 720 are disposed long the lower horizontal support members 240 , 340 , 440 of the other subframes 200 , 300 , 400 and aligned with bottom apertures 720 disposed along the other lateral support members . each aligned pair of bottom apertures 720 is oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lower horizontal support member 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 or lateral support member into which it is formed , and has a substantially cylindrical inside diameter . so configured , each pair of aligned bottom apertures 720 forms a single continuous passage through the corresponding adjacent lower horizontal support member and lateral support member . the bottom fasteners 740 may be configured similarly to the side fasteners 730 of the attachment component 700 . in the preferred embodiment , the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 are removably secured to the frame 10 by the attachment component 700 . in this embodiment , each sidewall has a first vertical edge 652 , a second vertical edge 654 , a top edge 656 , a bottom edge 658 , a plurality of first edge apertures 662 located proximate to the first vertical edge 652 , and a plurality of second edge apertures 664 located proximate to the second vertical edge 654 . see fig5 . the first edge apertures 662 of the first sidewall 610 are aligned with the first corner apertures of the attachment component 700 and the second edge apertures 664 of the first sidewall 610 are aligned with the fourth corner apertures . the first edge apertures 662 of the second sidewall 620 are aligned with the second corner apertures and the second edge apertures 664 of the second sidewall 620 are aligned with the first corner apertures . the first edge apertures 662 of the third sidewall 630 are aligned with the third corner apertures and the second edge apertures 664 of the third sidewall 630 are aligned with the second corner apertures . the first edge apertures 662 of the fourth sidewall 640 are aligned with the fourth corner apertures and the second edge apertures 664 of the fourth sidewall 640 are aligned with the third corner apertures . the first sidewall 610 is secured to the frame 10 by placing its first vertical edge 652 between the first vertical support member 110 of the head subframe 100 and the second vertical support member 320 of the first side subframe 300 such that the side fasteners 730 placed within the first corner apertures pass through the first edge apertures 662 of the first sidewall 610 , and by placing the second vertical edge 654 of the first sidewall 610 between the second vertical support member 120 of the head subframe 100 and the first vertical support member 410 of the second side subframe 400 such that the side fasteners 730 placed within the fourth corner apertures pass through the second edge apertures 664 of the first sidewall 610 . in a similar manner the first and second edges 652 , 654 of the remaining sidewalls 620 , 630 , 640 are placed between pairs of vertical support members 110 , 320 , 120 , 410 , 420 , 210 , 220 , 310 , with side fasteners 730 passing through the edge apertures 662 , 664 of the sidewalls 620 , 630 , 640 . the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 may further comprise a plurality grommets 670 , with the grommets 670 located within the edge apertures 662 , 664 , one grommet 670 per aperture 662 , 664 . this strengthens the stress points between the side fasteners 730 and the edge apertures 662 , 664 and creates a more durable sidewall . thus , the edges 652 , 654 , 656 , 659 of the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 are sandwiched between pairs of vertical support members 110 , 320 , 120 , 410 , 420 , 210 , 220 , 310 , with the side fasteners 730 placed through the edge apertures 662 , 664 to prevent slippage . this configuration allows the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 to be very securely attached to the frame 10 , yet easily removed simply by removing the side fasteners 730 and separating the subframes . in yet another embodiment the vertical support members 110 , 120 , 210 , 220 , 310 , 320 , 410 , 420 may comprise indentations on their adjacent surfaces at the edge apertures 662 , 664 to accommodate the grommets 670 , allowing an even tighter fit between the subframes . in another embodiment of the present invention , the top edge 656 of the first sidewall 610 is removably attached to the upper horizontal support member 130 of the head subframe 100 , the top edge 656 of the second sidewall 620 is removably attached to the upper horizontal support member 330 of the first side subframe 300 , the top edge 656 of the third sidewall 630 is removably attached to the upper horizontal support member 230 of the foot subframe 200 , and the top edge 656 of the fourth sidewall 640 is removably attached to the upper horizontal support member 430 of the second side subframe 400 . the top edges 656 of the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 may also be wrapped over and around the upper horizontal support members 130 , 230 , 330 , 430 of the subframes 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 . see fig5 . there may further be a plurality of top edge apertures located proximate to the top edge 656 of each sidewall 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 , through which may be placed top fasteners . this creates a tighter fit of the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 to the frame 10 . in yet another embodiment , the bottom edges 658 of the first sidewall 610 , the second sidewall 620 , the third sidewall 630 , and the fourth sidewall 640 are removably attached to the lower horizontal support members 140 , 340 , 240 , 440 of the head subframe 100 , the first side subframe 300 , the foot subframe 200 , and the second side subframe 400 , respectively . in one configuration , the first sidewall 610 has a plurality of bottom edge apertures located proximate to its bottom edge 658 and aligned with the bottom apertures 720 of the head support member 510 , the second sidewall 620 has a plurality of bottom edge apertures located proximate to its bottom edge 658 and aligned with the bottom apertures 720 of the first side support member 530 , the third sidewall 630 has a plurality of bottom edge apertures located proximate to its bottom edge 658 and aligned with the bottom apertures 720 of the foot support member , and the fourth sidewall 640 has a plurality of bottom edge apertures located proximate to its bottom edge 658 and aligned with the bottom apertures 720 of the second side support member 540 . the first sidewall 610 is further secured to the frame 10 by placing its bottom edge 658 between the lower horizontal support member 140 of the head subframe 100 and the head support member 510 of the mattress support component 500 such that the bottom fasteners 740 placed within the aligned bottom apertures 720 of the lower horizontal support member 140 of the head subframe 100 and the head support member 510 of the mattress support component 500 pass through the bottom edge apertures of the first sidewall 610 . in a similar manner the bottom edges 658 of the remaining sidewalls 620 , 630 , 640 are placed between corresponding pairs of lower horizontal support members 240 , 340 , 440 and lateral support members , with bottom fasteners 740 passing through the bottom edge apertures of the sidewalls 620 , 630 , 640 . see fig4 b . the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 may further comprise a plurality of grommets 670 , with the grommets 670 located within the bottom edge apertures , one grommet 670 per aperture . thus , the bottom edges 658 of the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 are sandwiched between corresponding pairs of lower horizontal support members and lateral support members , with the bottom fasteners 740 placed through the bottom edge apertures of the sidewalls 610 , 620 , 630 , 640 to prevent slippage . in yet another embodiment the lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 and lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 may comprise indentations on their adjacent surfaces at the bottom apertures 720 to accommodate the grommets 670 , allowing an even tighter fit between the paired lower horizontal support members 140 , 240 , 340 , 440 and lateral support members 510 , 530 , 540 . modifications and variations may be made to the disclosed

"with the reference symbol 1 , a hook base of a hook assembly 3 is designated . in fig1 , a bobbin case 5 with a bobbin 7 inserted therein lies above the hook base 1 . the bobbin case 5 with the bobbin 7 is thus not yet inserted into the hook base 1 . this is a state after the replacement / filling of the bottom thread bobbin 7 . in the hook base 1 , a connection element 11 is placed on a spindle 9 constructed centrally . this element is connected rigidly to the spindle 9 but can rotate axially and can be made from plastic or metal . the periphery of the connection element 11 can have a cylindrical construction ( no illustration ) or , as shown in the figures , it can have a shoulder - shaped neck section in the upper region . the bobbin case 5 comprises , in the center , a borehole 13 that has a cylindrical profile in the upper part a and that has a cylindrical construction in the lower part b over a partial region of the periphery of the borehole 13 , e . g ., over 180 °, and the opposite region is formed by a cylindrical section whose axis lies at an angle to the axis of the other region ( cf . fig1 - 4 , in each , left side of the borehole 13 ). in the end region of the bobbin case 5 , the borehole 13 can have a closed construction or its cross section can have a smaller diameter than the cylindrical section a of the borehole 13 lying underneath . on a circular shoulder 15 or a flat end face on the upper end of the connection element 11 , a coaxially arranged coil spring 17 is supported . the spring 17 is attached with its upper end on the bobbin case 5 , e . g ., clamped or bonded . when the bobbin case 5 is placed on top , the upper end ring 19 of the coil spring 17 therefore contacts the bobbin case 5 . advantageously , the end ring 19 is larger in diameter than the rest of the windings . the coil spring 17 is dimensioned such that , in the case of a bobbin case 5 locked completely in the hook base 1 , the coil spring 17 is under compressive force and , when the bobbin case 5 is released , the coil spring 17 lifts or ejects the bobbin case 5 at least partially from the hook base 1 , in order to simplify the grasping of the bobbin case 5 . on the lower end of the connection element 11 , also called the case carrier , a circular groove 21 is countersunk . the axial height of the groove 21 is slightly greater than the axial height of a crescent - shaped flange section 23 directed inward and running over a partial region of the borehole 13 on the bobbin case 5 . the distance of the inner edge 25 of the flange section 23 relative to the opposite , non - parallel wall section b is slightly larger than the diameter of the connection element 11 ( cf . fig6 ). below , the functioning of the hook assembly 3 will be explained in greater detail . the bobbin case 5 equipped with a new bobbin 7 , i . e ., a bobbin filled with thread , is pushed axially from the top over the connection element 11 . here , the coil spring 17 comes into spring contact with the upper end of the connection element 11 . a marking 29 is formed eccentrically on the end face 27 of the bobbin case 5 . the marking 29 can be coloring or a region provided with grooves by means of , for example , a laser beam , or can consist of a recess . for engaging or locking the bobbin case 5 , the person sewing presses with one finger approximately in the center on the bobbin case 5 ( arrow f 1 ); for further pressing , the bobbin case 5 becomes slightly tilted by the flange 23 provided only over a partial region ( ca . 180 °) on the lower end of the borehole 13 , as is visible in fig2 . through this inclined position , it becomes possible that the crescent - shaped flange 23 on only part of the periphery can slide past the lateral surface of the connection element 11 and can then engage in the groove 21 , when the bobbin case 5 tilts back to the horizontal . for releasing the bobbin case 5 from the hook base 1 , the procedure is reversed , in that , a pressure according to arrow f 2 is exerted with a finger on the eccentrically formed marking 29 and thus the bobbin case 5 tilts and the edge 25 of the flange 23 moves out from the groove 21 and then the bobbin case 5 is lifted by the force of the coil spring 17 until it can be raised with two fingers from the hook base 1 . in fig5 , a bobbin 7 is shown in the axial section that is not supported in a bobbin case 5 . so that it can rotate within the hook base 1 during sewing , a sleeve 31 is inserted so that it can rotate in the center of the bobbin 7 . the sleeve 31 comprises , both at the top and also at the bottom , means , e . g ., a raised edge or flange 33 , wherein these means hold the sleeve 31 in the bobbin 7 axially with play . the borehole 13 in the sleeve 31 is constructed analogous to the borehole 13 in the bobbin case 5 in the examples 1 to 4 . in other words , the upper region a is cylindrical and approximately half of the lower region b has a profile of a cylinder - barrel surface inclined toward the axis of the bobbin case 5 ( cf . also fig2 ). the upper end of the sleeve 31 is closed and is used as a contact for the coil spring 17 not shown in fig5 . in the ring - shaped flange of the sleeve 31 lying at the top , a marking 29 is formed eccentrically , as in the first embodiment , in order to indicate to the operator at which point he must apply a pressing force f 2 for unlocking . in another construction of the invention shown in fig8 , the connection element 11 is part of the spindle 9 , i . e ., the periphery of the spindle 9 has the shape of the periphery of the connection element 11 in the first embodiment . the function of the insertion or ejection of the bobbin case 5 with the bobbin 7 takes place in the same way .",3
"the pixel array 100 shown schematically in fig1 includes photo - sensitive pixels 110 , 140 , i . e ., circuitry for sensing light . although only two photo - sensitive pixels 110 and two photo - sensitive pixels 140 are shown , the pixel array 100 may in fact include many more or fewer photo - sensitive pixels 110 , 140 . the pixel 110 includes a p - type photodiode 112 as a photo - sensitive element . the photodiode 112 in each pixel 110 corresponds to an image pixel , i . e ., a fraction of the image to be sensed . more than one photodiode may also correspond to the same image pixel . the cathode 114 of the p - type photodiode 112 is connected to a supply voltage denoted as vdd . vdd can be , for example , 3v or 5v . the anode 116 of the p - type photodiode 112 is connected to a charge - sharing line 102 . more generally , as illustrated in the pixel array 100 of fig1 , the charge - sharing line 102 is connected to the anode 116 of each p - type photodiode 112 in each photo - sensitive pixel 110 . the anode 116 is also connected to a terminal 120 of a reset switch 118 . the reset switch 118 also includes a control terminal 122 , and a terminal 124 connected to a reference voltage denoted as vmid . typically , the reference voltage vmid is less than the supply voltage vdd . for example , if vdd is 5v , vmid can be 3 . 5v or 2 . 5v , and if vdd is 3v , vmid can be 1 . 5v or 1 . 2v . the control terminal 122 of the reset switch 118 in each pixel 110 is connected to a signal denoted as reset −. although the reset switch 118 of the pixel 110 is depicted as a p - type metal oxide semiconductor field - effect transistor ( p - mosfet ), other types of switches including n - type mosfets ( n - mosfets ), transistors , and other non - semiconductor switches may also be used . the pixel 140 includes an n - type photodiode 142 that can operate as a photo - sensitive element . the cathode 146 of the n - type photodiode 142 in each pixel 140 is connected to the charge sharing line 102 . the anode 144 of the n - type photodiode is connected to a certain reference voltage , e . g ., ground voltage or 0v , typically denoted as gnd . the cathode 146 is also connected to a terminal 150 of a reset switch 148 . in a similar fashion to the reset switch 118 in the pixel 110 , the reset switch 148 includes a control terminal 152 , and a terminal 154 connected to the reference voltage vmid . it should be understood , however , that although fig1 shows the reference voltage vmid connected to all pixels 110 , 140 , the reset switches of different pixels may in fact be connected to different reference voltages ( e . g ., vmid1 , vmid2 , etc . ), having different values , such as 2 . 5v and 3v . the control terminal 152 of the reset switch 148 in each pixel 140 is connected to a signal denoted as reset +. the reset switch 148 of the pixel 140 is depicted as an n - mosfet , but , again , other types of switches such as p - mosfets , transistors , and other non - semiconductor switches may also be used . the charge - sharing line 102 is connected to a gate terminal 162 of a driver 160 . the driver 160 is configured as a source follower , i . e ., it produces an output at a drain terminal 164 that is proportional to the voltage at the gate terminal 162 . the voltage at the gate terminal 162 is determined by the charge accumulated on the charge - sharing line 102 . a source terminal 166 of the driver 160 is connected to a supply voltage , e . g ., vdd . the drain terminal 164 of the driver 160 is connected to a select switch 170 having a select input 172 . when the select input 172 is activated , the select switch 170 turns “ on ” and a signal ( e . g ., a voltage signal ) at the drain terminal 164 is substantially reproduced at the output terminal 174 of the select switch 170 . the embodiment of the pixel array 100 depicted in fig1 employs n - mosfets as the driver 160 and select switch 170 . this , however , is for illustration only , and other types of devices such as p - mosfets , transistors , and other non - semiconductor devices may also be used as the driver 160 and / or select switch 170 . moreover , the device used for the driver 160 need not be of the same type as the device used for the select switch 170 . to perform image sensing , the pixel array 100 is exposed to a view to be imaged , such as a view from a camera . the reset switches 118 , 148 are turned on substantially simultaneously by activating the respective select signals reset − and reset +. the signal reset − is activated by setting it to a voltage that is substantially less than the voltage at the terminal 124 , i . e ., vmid . for example , the signal reset − may be set to 0v . the signal reset + is activated by setting it to a voltage substantially the same as the voltage vmid at the terminal 154 , e . g ., 3 . 5v . the reset signals are held active for a predetermined reset duration , on the order of a few nanoseconds . during this time , the photodiodes 112 , 142 are “ reset ,” i . e ., the voltages at the anode 116 of the photodiode 112 and at the cathode 146 of the photodiode 142 are set to be approximately equal to vmid . accordingly , the voltage on the charge - sharing line 102 is also approximately equal to vmid . after the reset duration , the reset switches 118 , 148 are turned off substantially simultaneously by deactivating the respective select signals reset − and reset +. each photodiode 112 , 142 that is exposed to a portion of the view to be imaged ( i . e ., an image pixel ) accumulates a charge proportional to the intensity of the light incident upon the photodiode from the image pixel . in particular , the n - type photodiodes 142 accumulate and discharge electrons at the cathode 146 . because the number of electrons discharged at each cathode 146 is proportional to the intensity of the light from the associated image pixel , the number of electrons ( i . e ., the accumulated charge ) at each cathode 146 represents the value of the associated image pixel . as all cathodes 146 are connected to the charge - sharing line 102 , the electrons from all cathodes 146 are accumulated , i . e ., “ added ” on the charge - sharing line 102 . thus , the charge on the charge - sharing line 102 due to the accumulated electrons is related to the sum of the image - pixel values associated with the photodiodes 142 . the p - type photodiodes 112 accumulate and discharge holes at the anode 116 . in a similar fashion to the case of the n - type photodiodes 142 , the number of holes discharged at the anode 116 of each p - type photodiode 112 is proportional to the intensity of the light from the image pixel associated with the photodiode 112 . accordingly , the number of holes ( i . e ., the accumulated charge ) at each anode 116 represents the value of the associated image pixel . all anodes 116 are also connected to the charge - sharing line 102 , so that the holes from all anodes 116 are accumulated , i . e ., “ added ” on the charge - sharing line 102 . thus , the charge on the charge - sharing line 102 due to the accumulated holes is related to the sum of the image - pixel values associated with the photodiodes 112 . in the pixel array 100 , all anodes 116 and cathodes 146 are connected to the charge - sharing line 102 . as a result , the holes collectively discharged at all anodes 116 and the electrons collectively discharged at all cathodes 146 combine on the charge - sharing line 102 . an electron - hole combination nullifies the charges associated with each individual electron and hole in the pair and , as a result , the charge on the charge - sharing line 102 can be expressed as the difference between the sum of charges due to all holes and the sum of charges due to all electrons . in effect , the charge on the charge - sharing line 102 represents the sum of pixel values associated with the p - type photodiodes 142 minus the sum of pixel values associated with the n - type photodiodes 112 . thus , the net charge on the charge - sharing line 102 corresponds to a pixel value obtained by adding the pixel values associated with the p - type photodiodes 142 and subtracting therefrom the pixel values associated with each n - type photodiode 112 . if more electrons were discharged at the cathodes 146 than holes discharged at the anodes 116 , the net charge on the charge - sharing line 102 would be negative , causing the voltage on the charge - sharing line 102 to decrease from the reset value vmid . conversely , if more holes than electrons were discharged , the net charge would be positive , causing the voltage on the charge - sharing line 102 to increase from vmid . the net voltage on the charge - sharing line 102 , denoted as vpix , is also present at the gate 162 of the driver 160 . therefore , the voltage at the drain terminal 164 changes according to vpix . after a pre - determined duration of accumulating the above - described charges , called the integration time ( typically on the order of a few milliseconds ), the select switch 170 is activated by activating the select input 172 . then , an output signal , denoted as vout , is produced at the output terminal 174 having a voltage substantially the same as the voltage at the drain terminal 164 . as the voltage at the drain terminal 164 is related to vpix , which represents the addition and subtraction of various image pixels , the signal vout also represents addition and subtraction of the image pixels . advantageously , in the pixel array 100 , the value of an individual image pixel is merely represented as a charge at an anode 116 or at a cathode 146 . individual pixel values are not digitized , and are not sent to a processor for analog - to - digital conversion . this substantially decreases the required processor capacity and the number of interconnects that would otherwise be required to deliver the charges sensed at each pixel 110 , 140 to the processor for the analog - to - digital conversion . moreover , a digitized value corresponding to each individual image pixel is not stored in a memory cell . only the signal at the output 174 ( i . e ., vout ) is digitized and stored in memory . thus , the size of the memory that is required to store the compressively sampled signals is substantially smaller than the memory that would otherwise be required to store each pixel value individually . as mentioned , in the pixel array 100 , circuitry including the driver 160 and the switch 170 produces a voltage at the output terminal 174 that is related to the voltage vpix at the gate terminal 162 , but , in doing so , the circuitry generally introduces some noise ( denoted as vnoise ). in addition , the voltage at the terminal 174 may also be offset by a threshold voltage vth , a parameter associated with the driver 160 and selector - switch 170 circuitry . typically , the noise and the threshold voltage are not known and , hence , the value corresponding only to the addition and / or subtraction of pixels cannot easily be extracted from the output signal vout at the terminal 174 . often , the noise and the threshold voltage offset values are not substantial , and do not significantly affect the accuracy of the added and / or subtracted pixel values obtained from the output signal vout . in these cases , the pixel array 100 works just fine . in some very high - resolution image - sensing applications , however , it is desirable to mitigate or eliminate the effect of the noise and the threshold voltage . some methods , such as obtaining a pixel value from the output signal vout after resetting the photodiodes 112 , 142 , storing that value in a temporary memory , reading a pixel value corresponding to vpix , as described above , and subtracting from this pixel value the value stored in the temporary memory can mitigate the effects of noise and threshold - voltage offset . the temporary memory storage and the subtraction operation , however , can significantly increase the system size and / or power consumption . the pixel array 200 illustrated in fig2 can be employed , however , to avoid or mitigate the noise and threshold - voltage offset effects without substantially increasing the system size , power consumption , or cost . in the pixel array 200 , the pixel 210 includes a transfer switch 280 having a transfer control input 282 . the anode 116 of the p - type photodiode 112 is connected to a terminal 284 of the transfer switch 280 . a terminal 286 of the transfer switch 280 is connected to the charge - sharing line 102 and to the terminal 120 of the reset switch 118 . the transfer control input 282 of each transfer switch 280 in each pixel 210 is connected to a signal tg +. the transfer switch 280 is illustrated as being a p - mosfet , but it may also be another type of field - effect transistor ( fet ), transistor , or a non - semiconductor switch . the pixel 240 includes a transfer switch 290 having a transfer control input 292 . the cathode 146 of the n - type photodiode 142 is connected to a terminal 294 of the transfer switch 290 . a terminal 296 of the transfer switch 290 is connected to the charge - sharing line 102 and to the terminal 150 of the reset switch 148 . the transfer control input 292 of each transfer switch 290 in each pixel 240 is connected to a signal tg −. the transfer switch 290 is illustrated as being an n - mosfet , but it may also be another type of fet , transistor , or a non - semiconductor switch . in the pixel array 200 , one or more of the p - type photodiode 112 and / or one or more of the n - type photodiode 142 can be pinned photodiodes . moreover , the pixels 210 , 240 can be back - illuminated pixels and / or photogate pixels . in operation of the pixel array 200 , both the reset switch 118 and the transfer switch 280 in pixel 210 are turned on substantially simultaneously during the reset period . the transfer switch 280 is turned on by settling the signal tg + to a voltage less than vmid ( e . g ., 0v ). after resetting the photodiode 112 , the reset switch 118 and the transfer switch 280 are turned off substantially simultaneously . the p - type photodiode 112 then accumulates charge according to the intensity of the light received from the image pixel associated with the photodiode 112 . accordingly , the photodiode 112 discharges holes at the anode 116 , as described above . but , in this case , because the transfer switch 280 is turned off , these holes are not transferred to the nodes 286 , 120 ( collectively referred to as a floating - diffusion node ) or to the charge - sharing line 102 . the reset switch 118 is then turned on a second time , setting the voltage at the nodes 286 , 120 substantially equal to vmid , and is thereafter again turned off . the pixel 240 is operated in a similar fashion , where both the transfer switch 290 and the reset switch 148 are turned on substantially simultaneously , thereby resetting the n - type photodiode 142 , and then off substantially simultaneously so that the electrons discharged at the cathode 146 are not transferred to the nodes 296 , 150 . the reset switch 148 is then turned on a second time ( substantially at the same time at which the reset switch 118 is turned on a second time ), setting the voltage at the nodes 296 , 150 substantially to vmid , and is thereafter again turned off . once the voltage at nodes 286 , 120 and 296 , 150 are set substantially equal to vmid , the select switch 172 is turned on . a first reading of the signal at the terminal 174 , denoted as vout_ref , is then related to vmid . in particular , vout_ref can be expressed as vmid + vth + vnoise . subsequently , the transfer switches 280 , 290 are turned on . as a result , the electrons accumulated at cathodes 146 are transferred to the charge - sharing line 102 through switches 290 , and the holes accumulated at anodes 116 are also transferred to the charge - sharing line 102 through switches 280 . as described above with reference to fig1 , the electrons and holes combine on the charge - sharing line 102 so as to represent a charge corresponding to a pixel value obtained by adding the individual pixel values associated with the p - type photodiodes 142 and subtracting therefrom the individual pixel values associated with each n - type photodiode 112 . thus , the voltage on the charge - sharing line 102 after turning on the transfer switches 280 , 290 corresponds to vpix , as described above . a second reading of the signal at the terminal 174 , denoted as vout_pix , is related to vpix , and may be expressed as vpix + vmid + vth + vnoise . the difference between vout_pix and vout_ref substantially eliminates the effect of vth and vnoise , i . e ., the effect of the unknown threshold voltage and noise . accordingly , the difference between the two readings of the output signal at the terminal 174 virtually yields only vpix , which corresponds to the addition and / or subtraction of individual pixels . although in fig1 and 2 all p - type photodiodes 112 share common control inputs reset − and / or tg +, and all n - type photodiodes 142 share common control inputs reset + and / or tg −, this is for illustrative purposes only . in other embodiments , only a subset of the p - type photodiodes 112 share a common reset control , or a common transfer control , or both . similarly , only a subset of the n - type photodiodes 142 may share a common reset control , or a common transfer control , or both . in yet other embodiments , each photodiode may have a distinct pair of reset and transfer control inputs . in a pixel array 300 , depicted in fig3 , the pixels 310 , 340 comprise p - type photodiodes 312 and n - type photodiodes 342 , respectively , and each pixel 310 , 340 shares a common reset switch 318 . in this embodiment , the photodiodes 312 , 342 may not be reset individually , but because fewer switches ( e . g ., transistors ) are required compared to the pixel array 100 ( shown in fig1 ), the pixel array 300 can be smaller than the pixel array 100 . similarly , in the pixel array 400 shown in fig4 , the pixels 410 , 440 share a common reset switch 418 , and , hence , the photodiodes included therein may not be reset individually . but , the pixel array 400 can be smaller than the pixel array 200 shown in fig2 due to the use of fewer switches . in another embodiment according to the invention , a pixel array includes only one type of photodiode ( e . g ., only p - type photodiodes or only n - type photodiodes ). one set of pixels , designated as “ a ” pixels , shares one pair of reset and transfer control signals , namely r1 and t1 . another set of pixels , designated as “ b ” pixels , shares another pair of reset and transfer control signals , namely r2 and t2 . all pixels “ a ” and “ b ,” however , are connected to the same charge - sharing line and driver / selector circuitry . initially , the “ a ” and “ b ” pixels are reset by activating the r1 , t1 , r2 , and t2 signals , as described above with reference to fig2 , and a signal vout_ref is measured . then , r1 , r2 , t1 , and t2 are deactivated , and , after the integration time , only t1 is activated . a value corresponding to the sum of all “ a ” pixels , denoted as vout_apix , is measured . soon thereafter , t2 is activated , allowing the charges accumulated by the “ b ” pixels to be combined with the charge accumulated by all “ a ” pixels , which is already present on the charge - sharing line . accordingly , a value corresponding to the sum of all “ a ” and “ b ” pixels , denoted as vout_a + bpix , is measured . by digitizing vout_apix and vout_a + bpix , and by subtracting the digitized value of vout_apix from vout_a + bpix , a value corresponding to the sum of all “ b ” pixels can be obtained . from these values , a value corresponding to the sum of all “ a ” pixels minus the sum of all “ b ” pixels can also be computed . in an alternative embodiment , after measuring vout_apix , as described above , the voltage at the charge - sharing line that is common to the “ a ” and “ b ” pixels is reset , e . g ., to vmid , by activating and deactivating the r1 and r2 signals . then t2 is activated as before , but now only the charges accumulated by the “ b ” pixels are combined at the charge - sharing line . accordingly , a value corresponding to the sum of all “ b ” pixels , denoted as vout_bpix , is measured . by digitizing vout_apix and vout_bpix , a value corresponding to the sum of all “ a ” pixels minus the sum of all “ b ” pixels and / or the sum of all “ b ” pixels minus the sum of all “ a ” pixels can be computed . the photodiodes corresponding to the “ a ” and “ b ” pixels can be of the same type or can be of different types , i . e ., the “ a ” pixels may correspond to p - type or n - type photodiodes , and , accordingly , the “ b ” pixels may correspond to n - type or p - type photodiodes . in yet another embodiment according to the invention , a pixel array includes more than one charge - sharing line , where each line is connected to a different set of pixels in the array . each charge - sharing line may also be associated with a driver / selector circuitry such as that including the driver 160 and the select switch 170 shown in fig1 and 2 . accordingly , the pixels in the set associated with each charge - sharing line may be added and / or subtracted , and a signal representing the sampled ( i . e ., processed ) pixel value for the associated set may be output from the driver / selector circuitry . these signals can be digitized , and additional arithmetic operations can be performed on the digitized values resulting in additions and / or subtractions , or other functions , of the sums of pixel values from each set . in general , a pixel array or focal plane can be configured as an m × n matrix where n is the number of charge - sharing lines and output signals , and m is the number of pixels in a set associated with each charge - sharing line . for example , a 2 × 2 pixel array includes two charge - sharing lines c 1 , c 2 , two pixels p 11 , p 12 connected to line c 1 , and two pixels p 21 , p 22 connected to line c 2 . all four pixels may be of the same type ( i . e ., accumulating electrons , or accumulating holes ), or p 11 , p 12 may be of one type and p 21 , p 22 may be of a different type . alternatively , p 11 , p 21 may be of one type and p 12 , p 22 may be of a different type . other configurations of pixel arrays , e . g ., 4 × 2 , 4 × 4 , 8 × 2 , 8 × 4 , 8 × 8 , etc ., are also within the scope of the invention . the numbers m and n can be selected to be substantially larger than 8 ( e . g ., 64 or larger ) so as to meet the requirements of a suitable sampling function . while the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims . the scope of the invention is thus indicated by the appended claims and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced .",7

"the remote starter switch 10 of the present invention has a cylindrical housing 11 with an internal bore 12 . a partition 14 extends across the bottom of housing 11 and contains a central cavity or recess 15 which receives one end 17a of spring 17 . also , partition 14 contains openings 19 and 20 and lip 21 around the top of cavity 15 extends higher than the top surface of partition 14 . openings 24 and 25 are located in opposite sides of housing 11 for cooling purposes ( see fig2 ) and cavities comprising spaces 26 and 27 are located in opposite side walls 14a and 14b , respectively of partition 14 . a first switch contact 30 comprises a leaf spring which has an upturned outer end 30a , connected to a flat section 30b which in turn is connected to end 30d by angular section 30c . end 30d connects with split sleeve 31 into which is pressed rivet 32 having an enlarged head 32a . similarly , a second contact 34 has an upturned outer end 34a connected to a flat section 34b which in turn is connected to end 34d by angular section 34c . end 34d connects with split sleeve 35 into which is pressed rivet 36 having an enlarged head 36a . external leads 38 and 39 connect to rivets 32 and 36 , respectively , and the switch makes and breaks the current between the leads . rivet 32 and 36 are prevented from passing through openings 19 and 20 , respectively because of the engagement of contact ends 30d and 34d , respectively , with the top of partition 14 . curved cutouts 12a are located in the wall 11 to facilitate the insertion of the rivets 32 and 36 downwardly through the bore 12 and into the openings 20 and 19 , respectively . the flat sections 30b and 34b have curved edges 30e and 34e which are located around upturned lip 21 to locate the contacts 30 and 34 over spaces 26 and 27 , respectively , so that the contact outer ends can bend downwardly into the spaces . a plunger 40 is closed at top end 40a and contains a bore 40b which communicates with open end 40c and receives the other end 17b of the spring . a metal eyelet 42 is tightly inserted into bore 40b and has a circular end flange 43 which overlaps open end 40c of the plunger . the flange 43 comprises the contact ring which electrically connects contacts 30 and 34 together upon movement of the plunger against the force of spring 17 . plunger 40 is slidable in bore 45a of guide 45 which also has a step 45b engaged by a shoulder 40d on plunger 40 . guide 34 fits snugly into the end of bore 12 of housing 11 and has two pins 47 projecting from opposite sides . also , housing 11 contains two bayonet type openings 48 ( only one shown ), each of which receives a pin 47 in order to secure the guide 45 to the housing . the pressure of spring 17 normally holds the pins 47 against the top of the bayonet openings 48 and holds flange 40d of plunger 40 against step 45b ( see fig1 ). a non - conductive fiber washer 50 is located below the end 45e of guide 45 and is of sufficient size to permit passage of contact ring 43 and plunger 40 therethrough in order to engage the contacts . the washer 50 serves to protect the guide end against heat created at the contacts . to assemble the switch , the rivets 32 and 36 with the contacts 30 and 34 attached thereto are inserted into the openings 19 and 20 and the contacts are aligned around the lip 21 so that each contact is over a cavity in the housing . plunger 40 is then inserted through the opening in guide 45 and the ends of spring 17 are inserted into cavity 15 and plunger bore 40b . thereafter , washers 50 and guide 45 are inserted into the housing 11 and the guide is turned so that a bayonet type connection is obtained between pins 47 and housing openings 48 . the spring 17 holds plunger 40 and contact ring 43 away from the upturned ends of the contacts ( see fig3 ). when it is desired to close the switch , a force in the direction of arrow 52 is applied to the plunger 40 causing compression of spring 17 and movement of contact ring 43 first against the top portion of upturned contact ends 30a and 34a which are not shielded by washer 50 ( see fig2 ). the tops of the contact ends will be the first contact areas . further downward movement of plunger 40 causes the flat section 30b and 34b to bend as the upturned ends 30a and 34a move into cavities 26 and 27 , respectively . after bending , contact ring 43 engages second contact areas comprising larger contact portions of flat sections 30b and 34b ( see portion 30b &# 39 ; of fig4 ). thereafter , the current between leads 38 and 39 will be primarily through the contact portions of flat section 30b , 34b and the contact ring . when it is desired to open the switch , the pressure on plunger 40 is removed and spring 17 will raise the contact ring 43 away from the contacts . the first contact portions to break contact will be the larger portion of the flat sections and the last portions to break contact will be the tops of contact ends 30a and 34a which were also the first portions to make contact . the tops of the contact ends provide fast breaking , point contacts where the make and break of the switch occurs . thus , any burning and corrosion will therefore occur at these points and there will be no such deterioration at the larger , second contact areas of the flat sections 30b and 34b . since the second contact areas will be clear of corrosion and burning , there will be an excellent conduction between the two contact areas and the contact ring . also , since plunger 40 is fully rotatable within the housing 11 , fresh areas of the contact ring can be continually brought against the first and second contact areas of the contacts so that excessive burning and corrosion of contact ring 34 can be prevented . thus , the switch is capable of carrying relatively large inductive currents with the use of small , low cost contacts which isolate the burning and corrosion occurring on make and break to small contact areas .",7
"the present invention will be discussed as embodied on a full duplex fddi ii ring network having a 100 mbps bandwidth . the ring network has 20 attached stations , each requiring a 20 mbps channel . this is depicted graphically in fig1 . in the preferred embodiment , the ring network is comprised of a dual media access control ( mac ) fddi ii network . in ring networks such as the one described above , real - time , isochronous information ( such as moving images and voice ) is allocated on a channel basis . in the fddi ii network in question ,, the 100 mbps bandwidth can be divided into 1536 - 64 kbps channels or any combination of these channels . since each of the 20 attached stations required a 20 mbps channel , in the prior art a total of 400 mbps ( 20 stations × 20 mbps per station ) worth of bandwidth is needed for the stations to communicate with each other . since fddi ii is only 100 mbps , these 20 stations could not all operate simultaneously on the network . it should be noted , however , that in practice , each station does not have a need to communicate to each of the other 19 stations simultaneously . rather , a station will normally require communication which some subgroup of the total . this fact opens up the possibility of assigning a portion of the bandwidth to a group of stations , and then reassigning the bandwidth to another group . the method by which this is accomplished , referred to as spacial reuse , is described in more detail below . the simplest implementation of spacial reuse occurs when the groups of stations on a ring network that wish to communicate with each other form contiguous , non - overlapping subgroups . this will be referred to as linearly distributed groups . for example , in the ring network of fig1 the communications requirements of the station could essentially divide the ring into five linearly distributed communications groups : communication group 1 , comprised of stations 1 - 4 , ( 21 ); communication group 2 , comprised of stations 5 - 8 ( 22 ); communication group 3 , comprised of stations 9 - 12 ( 23 ); and communications group 4 , comprised of stations 13 - 16 ( 24 ); and communications group 5 , comprised of stations 17 - 19 ( 25 ). ( note that the stations in each group are contiguous : that is , if the first station x and last station y in a group g are considered the end points of an arc on the circle formed by the ring network , each station lying on that arc -- or between station x and station y -- belongs to group g . in contrast , in the communications group formed of the stations 1 , 2 , 4 , the stations are not contiguous and hence this group would not be linearly distributed .) were unlimited bandwidth available , if each station required 20 mbps , then each group would be assigned one of channels a through e , each having an allocated bandwidth of 80 mbps . this is shown in table 1 . using the concept of spacial reuse of the present invention , however , each of the five groups is reallocated the same channel s at 80 mbps . ( this is shown in table 2 .) because each group is full duplex and contains its communication only within its own group , the channel is free for reuse outside of the spatial group . more particularly , assume channel s is comprised of the bands from 20 to 100 mbps , and further assume that station 6 needs to send message 2 to station 7 , within communication group 2 ; station 9 needs to send message 3b to station 12 within communication group 3 ; and station 10 needs to send message 3a to station 11 in communication group 3 . station 6 will use 40 - 60 mbps , station 9 will use 20 - 40 mbps , and station 10 will use 40 - 60 mbps . thus , reuse will occur for the bandwidth assigned to station 6 and station 10 . the details of the operation are as follows . station 6 will send message 2 to station 7 , occupying the clockwise bandwidth 40 - 60 mbps as the message travels between station 6 and station 7 . station 7 receives the message . at this point , data in 40 - 60 mbps is no longer required . this bandwidth is then free for station 10 ( which is &# 34 ; further down the line &# 34 ; on the ring network in terms of data traffic proceeding counterclockwise ) to use to send its message to station 11 . in the meantime , station 9 uses 20 - 40 mbps to communicate with station 12 . the bandwidth is not required once the traffic passes station 12 , hence , station 13 can make use of it if it wishes to communicate with any of the other stations in communication group 4 . this utilization is shown in fig3 . for an originating station requiring communications with a station in its subgroup situated in a counter - clockwise direction from it ( in fig1 this is equivalent to a station in a subgroup with a lower number than the originating station ), the bandwidth moving in the counterclockwise direction is used . a somewhat more complex situation occurs when the communication groups are &# 34 ; nested .&# 34 ; generally , two types of nesting can occur : regular nesting and cross boundary nesting . regular nesting ( or just nesting ) occurs when one group of stations is spatially located entirely within another group . for example , assuming stations are sequentially numbered clockwise , the communication group a consisting of stations 4 - 5 and 6 , is nested within the communication group b consisting of stations 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 . in this situation , as graphically depicted in fig2 communication group a ( 31 ) is nested within communication group b ( 32 ). cross boundary nesting ( or cb nesting ) occurs when two groups partially overlap so that one group extends across the boundary of the other . referring to fig3 communication group c ( 41 ) consisting of stations 4 , 5 and 6 is cb - nested in the communication group d ( 42 ) consisting of stations 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 . communications groups which do not overlap with any other group are referred to as independent groups . for example , referring to fig3 communication group e ( 43 ), consisting of stations 10 , 11 , and 12 , is independent of communication groups c and d . the operation of the invention in a nesting situation is as follows . consider a configuration of five groups depicted in fig4 : group 1 ( 51 ) is independent ; group 2 ( 52 ) is nested entirely within group 3 ( 53 ); and finally group 4 ( 54 ) and group 5 ( 55 ) are cb nested . in this configuration , under spacial reuse , channel s will be allocated to groups 1 , 2 , and 4 . these groups can be allocated the same channel because they are independent of each other . groups 3 and 5 can then also be allocated their own separate channel t because they are independent of each other . they must be assigned a different channel than the other groups because they are not independent ( nesting wise ) of the other groups . also , groups 1 , 2 , and 4 all reuse the same channel because they are nest - wise independent . the same holds for groups 3 and 5 . the stations of each group and their channel allocations are shown in table 3 . in the case of a non - contiguous communications group n , it can be observed that the invention may also be used provided those stations which , if included in group n would make n contiguous , are not required to be in another communication group . in essence , they are included in communications group n to make it linearly distributed . in order to implement the spatial reuse concept on a ring network like fddi , a management agent software would have to keep a logical and physical ring map ( which is part of the fddi standards ) and would have to allocate the channels based on spatial grouping . this algorithm would have to determine the physical ring map , determine the spatial groupings , determining the nesting between the groupings , and allocate the channels based on the independent groups . ( in this context , independent refers to groups that are not nested .) it can be observed that if there are no nested groups then all groups may be assigned the same single channel . for each nesting of groups an additional channel allocation will have to be provided ( one for each nest and / or each level of nesting ). thus it can be seen that by using spatial reuse , the bandwidth of a ring network can be enormously extended . although the implementation of the invention has been disclosed within the context of a fidi ii ring network , the invention can also find application in any ring - topology network . although a specific embodiment of the invention has been disclosed , it will be understood by those having skill in the art that changes can be made in the specific embodiment disclosed , without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention . table 1______________________________________prior art additionalgroup channel bandwidth allocated ( mbps ) ______________________________________1 . 1 - 4 a 802 . 5 - 8 b 803 . 9 - 12 c 804 . 13 - 16 d 805 . 17 - 20 e 80 total allocation : 400 mbps______________________________________ table 2______________________________________ additionalgroup channel bandwidth allocated ( mbps ) ______________________________________1 . 1 - 4 s 802 . 5 - 8 s / 3 . 9 - 12 s / 4 . 13 - 16 s / 5 . 17 - 20 s / total allocation : 80 mbps______________________________________ table 3______________________________________ additionalgroup channel bandwidth allocated ( mbps ) ______________________________________1 . 1 - 4 s 802 . 6 - 8 s / 3 . 5 - 9 t 804 . 11 - 15 s / 5 . 15 - 17 t / total allocation : 160 mbps______________________________________",7

branched or three - dimensional product . furthermore , monomers may themselves comprise repetitive building blocks , and when polymerized the polymers formed from such monomers are then termed “ blockpolymers ”. monomers may belong to various chemical classes of molecules including organic , organometallic or inorganic molecules . examples of organic monomers are acrylamide , vinylchloride , fluorene bisphenol or 3 , 3 ′- dihydroxytolane . examples of organometallic monomers are octamethyl -

5 reagents , or more . moreover , mixing the reagents need not be performed in a single step , but may also be performed in intervals . for example , in a mixture of equal proportions of both reagents , 10 ml of the first reagent may be combined with 1 ml of the second reagent . after a first predetermined time , another 4 ml of the second reagent may be added , and after second predetermined time , the remaining 5 ml of the second reagent may be added . similarly , it is contemplated that multiple layers of reagent mixtures may be employed to generate a plurality of layers with same or different ratio between the first and the second reagent . although the reagent mixture is preferably spin coated on a silicon waver , various alternative methods of applying the reagent mixture to a substrate are contemplated , including spray coating , dip coating , sputtering , brushing , doctor blading , etc . it is further contemplated that the reagent mixture need not necessarily be applied to a silicon waver as a substrate , but may also be applied to any material so long as such material is not substantially dissolvable in the solvent ( s ) contained in the reagent mixture . with respect to forming a polymeric structure , many methods other than heating the reagent mixture to 400 ° c . for 60min are contemplated . alternative methods include heating the reagent mixture to temperatures higher than 400 ° c ., for example , temperatures in the range of 400 ° c .- 500 ° c ., or higher , but also heating to lower temperatures than 400 ° c ., for example , temperatures in the range of 100 ° c . to 400 ° c . it is further contemplated that many durations other than 60min may be appropriate for forming a polymeric structure , including longer times in the range of 1 to several hours , and longer . similarly , shorter durations than 60 min are also contemplated , ranging from a few seconds to several minutes , and longer . it is further contemplated that by heating remaining volatile solvent in the polymeric structure is at least partially removed . moreover , heating may also advantageously rigidify the polymeric structure . although in preferred embodiment the polymeric structure is formed using heat , various alternative methods of forming the polymeric structure are contemplated , including catalyzed and uncatalyzed methods . catalyzed methods may include general acid - and base catalysis , radical catalysis , cationic - and anionic catalysis , and photocatalysis . for example , the formation of a polymeric structure may be catalyzed by addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide , addition of radical starters , such as ammoniumpersulfate , or by irradiation with uv -

z wherein z = 0 − 3 , and the formula c 2 h x f y , wherein x is an integer between 0 and 5 , and x + y is 6 . in this example , the hydrofluoric acid reacts and disintegrates the silica , resulting in dissolving the silica particle form the film and thus forming pores . particularly contemplated dissolving reagents are a 2 % ( w / v ) aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid , nf 3 , and nh 4 f , but also non - fluorinated solvents , including chlorinated hydrocarbons , cyclohexane , toluene , acetone , and ethyl acetate . the second reagent may also be removed by dry etching where the polymeric structure is exposed to etch gases , including h 2 f 2 , nf 3 , ch x f y , and c 2 h x f y , such that the silica is converted into volatile fluorosilicon components . the volatile fluorosilicon components are subsequently removed from the polymeric structure by heating or evacuating , thus forming a porous structure . it should also be appreciated that alternative methods need not be based on dissolving the second reagent , but may include various alternative methods other than thermolysis and other than evaporation . for example , appropriate methods include radiolysis using focused α -, or β -, or γ - rays , electromagnetic waves , chemical transformations of the second reagent , sonication , and cavitation . the following examples are given to illustrate the formation of a nanoporous low dielectric constant material according to the inventive subject matter . preparation of 10 wt % colloidal silica : starting material is mibk - st ( nissan chemical ) 30 wt % colloidal silica in mibk , particle size 12 nm . 80 gm of mibk - st were mixed with 160 gm cyclohexanone in a plastic flask with stirring . the preparation is named cs10 . 1 . 2 gm of neat hexamethyldisilazane ( hmdz ) were added to 240 gm cs10 in a plastic bottle and slowly stirred for one hour at room temperature to allow for reaction . the preparation is named cs10h . the objective is to make a more stable suspension of colloidal silica in organic solvent by modifying the surface of the colloidal silica from hydrophilic to hydrophobic . base matrix material : a solution of 10 wt % poly ( arylene ether ) resin in cyclohexanone is prepared and named x33 . base adhesion promoter : a solution of 25 wt % polycarbosilane polymer in cylcohexanone is prepared and named a3 solution . 50 / 50 poly ( arylene ether )/ silica formulation : 241 . 2 gm of cs10h were mixed with 241 . 2 gm of x33 , and 5 . 78 gm of a3 solution were added and mixed well . the final composition comprising 4 . 94 wt % poly ( arylene ether ), 4 . 92 wt % silica , 0 . 296 wt % polycarbosilane and 0 . 246 wt % hdmz is sonicated for 30 minutes , filtered through a 0 . 1 μm filter , and collected in plastic bottle . the solution prepared from example 1 was spun - coated onto an 8 ″ silicon wafer using a semd coater . spin conditions : the films were coated on a semix tr8002 - c coater with manual dispense , top side rinse ( tsr ) and back side rinse ( bsr ). the volume of dispense was about 5 ml and cyclo - hexanone was utilized as the top and back side rinse solvent . the spin speed was 2000 rmp for 50 seconds . the films were double coated to achieve about 7000 a thickness . bake conditions : all wafers were baked under nitrogen on the semix coater following each spin coating step . the bake conditions are given in the table 1 . cure conditions : wafers were cured in a horizontal furnace protected by a nitrogen flow of 60 liter / min . the oxygen concentration in nitrogen was less than 50 ppm . the curing sequence is listed in table 2 . the temperature quoted is the temperature of the furnace center and was confirmed to be accurate with a thermocouple at the furnace center where the demo wafers were cured . wet etch conditions : cured films were etched with 50 : 1 buffered oxide etcher ( boe ) at room temperature for 3 . 0 minutes to remove the silica , thus forming porous structure . after being etched , the wafers were rinsed with deionized water , isopropyl alcohol and de - ionized water . finally the wafers was dried at 150 ° c . in vacuum . ir spectroscopy : the ir spectra of porous poly ( arylene ether ) films on the wafers were recorded on a nicolet 550 infrared spectrophotometer . the amount of silica in the film was determined from the peak intensity at 1050 - 1150 cm − 1 whereas the concentration of poly ( arylene ether ) was monitored from the peak at 1500 cm − 1 . results for the peak intensity were listed in table 3 . no residual organic solvent , un - crosslinked acetylene group , and oxidation related ir absorption peaks are observed for the film at near 1700 - 1800 cm − 1 ( aliphatic carbonyl group ), 2900 cm − 1 ( aliphatic carbon - hydrogen bond ), 3500 cm − 1 ( o — h bond ), and 2210 cm − 1 ( carbon - carbon triple bond ). ir spectra of the porous flare ™ films also indicate over 97 % of embedded dielectrics has been converted to pore after wet etch . film thickness , thickness uniformity and refractive index : porous poly ( arylene ether ) film thickness , thickness uniformity and refractive index were shown in table 4 . the dielectric constant ( k ) of the film was calculated from the capacitance of the film with thickness ( t ) under aluminum dot , using a hewlett - packard lcr meter model hp4275a . the dielectric constant is obtained according to the following equation : where a is the area of the aluminum dot ( cm 2 ), c is the capacitance ( farad ), t is the film thickness ( cm ), and e o is the permittivity of the free volume ( 8 . 85419 × 10 − 14 f / cm ). the dielectric constant of the low k porous poly ( arylene ether ) and the solid poly ( aryene ether ) control after various treatments were listed in table 5 . a decrease in dielectric constant of about 0 . 73 was achieved after introducing porosity into the solid film . the dielectric constant of the porous film increased slightly by 0 . 13 after soaking in water at room temperature for 48 hours . however , the dielectric constant was the same as the pre - soaked value after drying in a hot plate heating for 2 minutes at 250c . no significant decrease in k was found for the porous film after heated in flowing nitrogen at 400c . for 20 hours , even though the film shrank in thickness of about 8 %. dielectric constant of the porous film was also unchanged after 30 - day storage at ambient conditions . thus , specific embodiments and methods for producing nanoporous material using a dissolvable reagent have been disclosed . it should be apparent , however , to those skilled in the art that many more modifications besides those already described are possible without departing from the inventive concepts herein . the inventive subject matter , therefore , is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims . moreover , in interpreting both the specification and the claims , all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the context . in particular , the terms “ comprises ” and “ comprising ” should be interpreted as referring to elements , components , or steps in a non - exclusive manner , indicating that the referenced elements , components , or steps may be present , or utilized , or combined with other elements , components , or steps that are not expressly referenced .",7
"for the purpose of illustration only , the following detailed description references a certain embodiment of an electron beam tomography ( ebt ) imaging system . it is understood that the present invention may be used with other imaging systems ( such as computed tomography systems , and other imaging systems , for example ). fig1 illustrates an ebt imaging system 100 formed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the system 100 includes an electron source 110 , a focusing coil 120 , deflection coils 130 , target rings 140 - 143 , a data acquisition system ( das ) 150 , a reconstruction system 155 , a detector array 160 , and an object positioner 170 . as will be described further below , the electron source 110 generates an electron beam that travels to the focusing coil 120 . at the focusing coil 120 , the electron beam is focused to create a narrow , elliptical beam spot on the target rings 140 - 143 . at the deflection coils 130 , the electron beam is deflected to sweep along one of the target rings 140 - 143 . when the focused electron beam hits one of the target rings 140 - 143 , the contacted target rings 140 - 143 emit a fan beam of x - rays . the point at which electrons from the electron beam are deflected onto the target ring 140 is referred to as the “ beam spot ” and serves as a source of imaging x - rays . in certain embodiments , there may be a single target ring 140 or a plurality of target rings 140 - 143 , for example . in certain embodiments , the target rings 140 - 143 are made of tungsten . the electron beam may be swept along a 210 degree arc to produce , at each spot along the arc , a fan beam of x - rays . the x - rays emitted from the target rings 140 - 143 pass through the object , such as a patient , for example , that is located on the object positioner 170 . the object positioner 170 may be a table , a support , a wall bucky , or other movable or non - movable positioner , for example . the x - rays then impinge upon the detector array 160 . the detector array 160 includes at least one row of detector elements . the detector elements of the detector array 160 generate signals in response to the impinging x - rays . the signals are transmitted from the detector array 160 to the das 150 . the das 150 collects the data and sends the data to a reconstruction system 155 . the reconstruction system 155 analyzes the signals and generates a medical diagnostic image from the data obtained from the detector array 160 . the reconstruction system 155 may also store data or transmit data to an external processor or memory , for example . the reconstruction system 155 may be embodied in software and / or in hardware , for example . the detector array 160 receives x - rays from several angles , along the arc over which the beam is swept , to produce a set of x - ray projections . the projection data is received by the das 150 , and the total data from one sweep are arranged in a matrix called a sinogram . within the sinogram , each row contains all projection data for one detector element , and each column contains data at a certain sample number for that detector element . from the two - dimensional sinogram of projection data , the reconstruction system 155 may reconstruct a two - dimensional image , typically characterizing an axial slice of the object imaged . backprojection or another reconstruction technique may be used to reconstruct the two - dimensional image . the resulting image , however , may contain streaks or image artifacts ( such as ghost images , for example ) due to imperfections or inaccuracies in the system 100 and position of system 100 components . examples of inaccuracies include errors in detector position or mischaracterization of the motion of the beam spot . calibration of the system 100 may help to reduce or eliminate streaks or image artifacts to improve image quality . a phantom may be used to calibrate the system 100 to improve image quality and accuracy , for example . fig2 illustrates a multipin phantom 200 used for system geometrical calibration in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the multipin phantom 200 includes a block 210 of foam or other similar material . the multipin phantom 200 also includes a plurality of pins placed on or in the block 210 . multiple pins enable the phantom 200 to triangulate on system 100 components , such as the detector array 160 and the individual detectors of the detector array 160 and electron beam , for example , and obtain additional measurements , such as radius , motion , and position , for example . in certain embodiments , the multipin phantom 200 includes pins 220 - 227 . the pins may include a metal , such as tungsten , for example . the pins 220 - 227 are placed roughly in a circle and are aligned along an axis of the detector array 160 . the pins 220 - 227 may be enclosed in a cylinder of plastic for protection . the multipin phantom 200 may be attached to a smaller cylinder that allows the multipin phantom 200 to be mounted on a centermount of the object positioner 170 . fig3 illustrates a flow diagram 300 for a method for calibrating a medical diagnostic imaging system 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . after a brief overview , the steps of the method will be described in further detail below . first , at step 310 , positions of the elements of the detector array 160 , coefficients of energy beam or source motion , and other manufacturer information are preloaded . then , at step 320 , the multipin phantom 200 is placed on the object positioner 170 , and a scan is acquired . next , at step 330 , phantom pin locations are analyzed . using the theoretical locations of the elements in the detector array 160 and theoretical motion of the beam spot along the target rings 140 - 143 , a rough estimation of the locations of pins 220 - 227 in the phantom 200 is made . then , at step 340 , the positions of the pins 220 - 227 and the motion of the beam spot along the target rings 140 - 143 is refined in a calculation that assumes the detector elements to be in their ideal location . at step 350 , the refined pin positions and beam spot motion are used to refine the positions of the detector elements . at step 360 , a quality metric called “ cluster error ” ( defined below ) is calculated and used to decide if the measurement of the detector element and beam spot positions is sufficient . if measurement is not sufficient , refinement continues in iterations of the above process . now the method of calibration will be described in more detail . first , at step 310 , theoretical ( or ideal or desired ) component position data is preloaded . the theoretical data may be the expected position of the center of the detector array 160 and of the individual detector elements in the detector array 160 , as well as coefficients describing the radial and angular motion of the beam spot produced by the energy source 110 . the preload of desired data may be preceded by a blank scan to account for background or noise in the ebt imaging system 100 . then , at step 320 , the multipin phantom 200 is scanned . the multipin phantom 200 may be placed on the object positioner 170 , without concern for the precise location of the multipin phantom 200 . next , at step 330 , the positions of the detectors in the detector array 160 and the motion of the electron beam are “ frozen ” at the assumed or theoretical values . a scan with the multipin phantom 200 is performed . a sinogram is produced from irradiation of the multipin phantom 200 by radiation , such as x - rays , for example , from the target rings 140 - 143 . by way of example only , 864 detector elements with 864 samples each may be included in the detector array 160 , and eight pins 220 - 227 may be included in the multipin phantom 200 . in this example , the sinogram obtained from the detector array 160 is an 864 - by - 864 sinogram . next , a trace of pins 220 - 227 through the sinogram is performed to identify the positions of individual pins 220 - 227 in the sinogram . areas of high attenuation are assumed to be pin 220 - 227 shadows and are characterized for their central points and traced through the sinogram . pin 220 - 227 position overlaps and other data may also be removed . by way of example , a sample may be obtained every 40 microseconds . the time at which the center of a pin 220 - 227 is detected may be a fractional sample number , such as sample number 1 . 25 . with 864 detector elements and 8 pins , the result is an 864 - by - 8 table of pin 220 - 227 samples sorted by pin number ( hereinafter , pin sample table ). pins 220 - 227 are identified by a sample number that corresponds to the time at which the sample was obtained ( e . g ., the time at which the center of the pin 220 - 227 was observed ). then , at step 340 , the detector array 160 position is “ frozen ” or held constant at the values calculated in step 330 . new values for the coefficients describing the motion of the beam spot on the target rings 140 - 143 and pin 220 - 227 positions are refined from values obtained in previous steps . the mathematical method of this refinement will be described in detail below . next , at step 350 , the source 110 and pin 220 - 227 positions are “ frozen ” or held constant at the values calculated in step 340 , and the detector array 160 positions are refined . detector position refinement proceeds in a manner similar to the pin 220 - 227 position refinement of step 340 . in effect , pin 220 - 227 positions and electron beam or source 110 motion may be used to triangulate on each detector position in the detector array 160 . then , at step 360 , an assessment of the self - consistency of the set of equations describing the system 100 is made . each entry in the pin sample table can be turned into a hypothetical ray from the detector element to the target ring 140 - 143 . one end of the detector - target ray is defined by the position of the detector element , while the other is defined by the location of the beam spot at the time that detector element saw the pin 220 - 227 . fig4 illustrates a ray tracing 400 used in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . in the ray tracing 400 , a ray extends from a detector element 465 to the target ring 140 . the actual position of the pin 220 may be unknown . after all detector - target rays for a given pin 220 - 227 are determined , the “ centroid ” of the rays is computed . the centroid is defined as a position in space which minimizes , in a least squares sense , the distance of closest approach of each ray to the centroid . the centroid is then assumed to be the position of the pin 220 - 227 for subsequent calculations . the least squares method is used to solve a set of equations with more equations than unknown variables . accordingly , the answer achieved is not an exact solution but rather a solution that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residual errors . fig5 illustrates a clustering 500 of rays analyzed with a least - squares method used in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . in fig5 , a plurality of rays from detector elements to the target ring 140 - 143 overlap to form the centroid in the region of the actual pin . the variation among the rays may be used to determine the accuracy of the system of equations describing the pin positions , detector element positions , and beam motion . once the centroid has been determined for all pins , a “ cluster error ” can be calculated . it is defined as the average distance by which each detector - target ray misses its own centroid . in a perfect system , cluster error would be zero . in practice , a cluster error of 5 microns , for example , usually indicates a sufficiently self - consistent solution for streak - free images . at step 370 , if the cluster error is above a certain threshold , refinement continues for the positions of the detector elements and the pins 220 - 227 , along with source 110 motion as a function of time . refinement continues according to the steps described above , starting at step 340 , for example . for example , if the average distance by which rays miss the centroids of the pins 220 - 227 is more than ten microns , the refinement iterations continue . each iteration of refinement may more precisely determine positions and characteristics . if the cluster error is below a certain threshold ( ten microns , for example ), the pin 220 - 227 , detector array 160 , and source 110 calculations are sufficient , and system 100 operation ( e . g ., imaging ) may proceed . that is , the detector position and source 110 motion may be used in reconstruction of a medical diagnostic image through backprojection or other imaging method , for example . while the answers obtained in the above calibration may not be perfect , the process may be iterated so that the solutions converge . in certain embodiments , calibration iterations converge to an answer in which an average ray will miss the centroid of its pin by no more than about three microns . an image generated after such calibration is virtually free of geometrically - caused streaks . iterative calibration also provides an accurate description in radius and angle of beam spot motion along the target rings 140 - 143 . the following is a discussion of the mathematical method used to refine system 100 parameters and component configuration . for example , first consider a one dimensional case represented in fig6 . assume there is a variable parameter “ x ” and a theoretical function “ f ” that operates on parameter x . for an observed empirical value , f ( x 0 ), a value x 0 may be determined that will cause the function f to produce an observed empirical value f ( x 0 ). analysis begins with an initial guess x 1 which , when acted upon by the theoretical function , produces a value f ( x 1 ). if the derivatives of function “ f ” may be calculated , a taylor &# 39 ; s series expansion is performed about point x 1 , since f ( x 0 ) is a known , empirical value , solving for “ h ” may reveal how much to vary x 1 to produce x 0 , the unknown quantity . solving for h is impractical , however , so the series is simplified to ignore second - order and higher terms . the resulting equation is equation 2 may be solved for h 1 , giving an approximate solution for an improved “ x ,” x 2 = x 1 + h 1 ( 3 ). proceeding in this fashion , approximations may be refined to produce x 3 , x 4 , etc ., each of which is closer to the desired value x 0 . that is , the input parameter may be refined until the theoretical function acting on the input parameter produces the desired observed value . however , rather than simply solving for a one - dimensional “ x ,” multiple parameters may be simultaneously optimized to produce a close theoretical match to thousands of detector - pin “ events ” visible in the sinogram of the multipin phantom 200 . the parameters include positions of each pin 220 - 227 , positions of the detector elements in the detector array 160 , and the coefficients of the fourier series describing the motion of the electron beam source in radius and angle , for example . therefore , for a given detector element d and a given pin p , the error ( difference between theoretical sample prediction q s and measured sample number q m ) may be written as q m d , p - q s d , p ≈ ∂ q d , p ∂ r p ⁢ | s ⁢ · ∇ r p + ∂ q d , p ∂ θ p ⁢ | s ⁢ · ∇ θ p + ∑ j ncoefs ⁢ ∂ q d , p ∂ rc j ⁢ | s ⁢ · ∇ rc j + ∑ j ncoefs ⁢ ∂ q d , p ∂ a ⁢ ⁢ c j ⁢ | s ⁢ · ∇ a ⁢ ⁢ c j ( 4 ) where r p represents the radius of pin p , θ p represents the angle of pin p , rc j represents the j th radial coefficient of beam motion , and ac j represents the j th angular coefficient of beam motion . in other words , the measured sample value of pin p in detector element d is roughly equal to the theoretical value plus the derivative of the sample function with respect to pin p &# 39 ; s radius times ∇ r , plus the derivative with respect to pin p &# 39 ; s angle times ∇ θ , plus the derivatives multiplied by the deltas of the source coefficient terms , etc . a desired result of the calculation is the values of the deltas (“∇”) that minimize the difference between measured pin sample values and theoretical values obtained by applying the system model (“ f ”) to the parameter values ( i . e ., pin position , beam motion coefficients , etc .). while equation ( 4 ) is one equation with multiple unknowns , creating simultaneous equations for all pins 220 - 227 seen by all detector elements in the detector array 160 results in more equations than unknowns . by casting the problem into a system of linear equations , an adjustment to the parameters ( represented by the vector h ) may be determined using singular value decomposition ( svd ). svd minimizes , in a least - squares sense , the disagreement between theoretical sample values and the empirically measured values . thus , equation ( 4 ) may be generalized to a system of equations denoted by where { right arrow over ( e )} represents the error or the difference between measurement and theory of each detector - pin combination , the vector δrc denotes adjustments or deltas for individual parameters to produce more accurate theoretical sample values , and p represents the matrix of partial derivatives of each detector - pin sample with respect to individual parameters . the error vector { right arrow over ( e )} mmay be represented as follows : detector 1 detector 2 . . . detectorn { right arrow over ( e )}=[ e 1 1 , e 2 1 , e 3 1 , . . . , e npins 1 , e 2 2 , e 3 2 , . . . , e npins 2 , . . . , e 1 n , e 2 n , e 3 n , . . . , e npins n ] (( 6 ), where e p d ddenotes a difference between empirical data and theory in the sample number of pin p as seen by detector d . the vector of parameter changes may be represented as follows { right arrow over ( h )}=[ δr p1 , δθ p1 , δr p2 , δθ p2 , . . . , δrc 1 , δrc 2 , δrc 3 , . . . , δac 1 , δac 2 , δac 3 , . . . ] (( 7 ), where δr p ddenotes a change in radius of pin p , δθ p represents a change in angle of pin p , δrc represents a change in radial source coefficient , and δac denotes a change in angular source coefficient . the matrix of derivatives p is shown below . in practice , pin position cross terms may be set to zero , as a deviation in the position of one pin position has only a second order effect on another pin position . p = [ ∂ q 11 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q 11 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ∂ q 12 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q 12 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ∂ q 13 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q 13 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯ ∂ q 21 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q 21 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ∂ q 22 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q 22 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ∂ q 23 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q 23 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯ ∂ q n1 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q n1 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ∂ q n2 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q n2 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ∂ q n3 ∂ r p1 ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ θ p1 ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ r p2 ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ θ p2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ rc 1 ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ rc 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ ac 1 ⁢ ∂ q n3 ∂ ac 2 ⁢ ⋯ ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯ ] ⁢ pin ⁢ ⁢ 1 pin ⁢ ⁢ 2 ⁢ ⁢ detector ⁢ ⁢ 1 pin ⁢ ⁢ 3 pin ⁢ ⁢ 1 pin ⁢ ⁢ 2 ⁢ ⁢ detector ⁢ ⁢ 2 pin ⁢ ⁢ 3 pin ⁢ ⁢ 1 pin ⁢ ⁢ 2 ⁢ ⁢ detector ⁢ ⁢ n pin ⁢ ⁢ 3 ⁢ ⁢ (( 8 ) tthe matrix p includes a number of rows equal to the number of detector elements n in the detector array 160 in the system 100 multiplied by the number n of pins 220 - 227 . the number of columns in the matrix p is equal to twice the number n of pins 220 - 227 ( one term for each radius , one term for each angle ) plus the number of source coefficients . the first set of columns represents derivative terms for the pin positions , varying the radius and angle of each pin according to sample number . the second set of columns varies the radius coefficients of the source electron beam . the third set of columns varies the angle coefficients of the source . calculation of the derivative terms may be accomplished numerically . once the equation e = h * p is set up , the solution involves using a singular value decomposition ( svd ) algorithm to solve for h . values in the vector h may be added to the initial parameters to provide a more accurate list of pin 220 - 227 positions and source 110 coefficients . improved detector element positions may also be calculated . solving for detector element positions by adding detector element positions to the system of equations results in too large of a solution space for current off - the - shelf computers . thus , a separate “ clustering ” method may be used in which detector element positions are solved for individually . for each detector element , the source coefficients are evaluated at the times of each pin 220 - 227 sighting ( yielding the source 110 positions ). rays may be drawn from the target 140 - 143 through the pins 220 - 227 . a point of convergence is calculated . the detector element position is updated to the point of convergence , barring errors or unlikely results . the process of setting up the system of equations , solving the system , and clustering of detector elements may then be repeated until a sufficient answer is obtained . in certain embodiments , motion and other characteristics of the energy beam may be modified based on the above described calibration method . for example , iterative calibration of the detector array 160 and energy source 110 is performed , as described above in reference to fig1 , 2 and 3 . then , beam spot motion information is used to adjust currents applied to the deflection coils 130 coils . a complete set of coil currents for a scan is called a “ tune .” fig7 illustrates an electron beam tuning system 700 formed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the system 700 includes a radial beam correction module 780 and an angular beam adjustment module 790 . the radial beam correction module 780 and the angular beam adjustment module 790 may be separate units or may be combined in a single unit . the radial beam correction module 780 and the angular beam adjustment module 790 may be embodied in hardware and / or in software . the system 700 may be used in conjunction with an electron source 710 , a focusing coil 720 , deflection coils 730 , target rings 740 - 743 , a das 750 , a reconstruction system 755 , a detector array 760 , an object positioner 770 , and a multipin phantom 775 . the electron source 710 , focusing coil 720 , deflection coil 730 , target rings 740 - 743 , das 750 , reconstruction system 755 , detector array 760 , object positioner 770 , and multipin phantom 775 are similar to the components described above in relations to fig1 and fig2 . in operation , tuning is similar to calibration described above . the multipin phantom 775 is placed on the object positioner 770 without particular regard to accuracy . a scan is acquired . then , the iterative computations previously described are performed to characterize the motion of the beam spot along the target rings 140 - 143 . once beam spot and / or electron beam motion have been determined , coil currents may be adjusted to optimize beam spot and / or electron beam movement . coil currents for the deflection coil are stored as a series of deflection update blocks ( dubs ). a dub represents a single “ quantum ” of coil currents sent to each deflection coil . in certain embodiments , a dub is stored for every twenty microseconds . thus , a single deflection buffer may contain thousands of dubs . in correcting radial fluctuations of the motion of the beam spot along the target rings 140 - 143 , the radius of the beam spot is examined at the time of each dub . if the radius is too large ( too much deflection ), the dipole currents in the deflection coil are decreased by a scale factor proportional to the size of the deviation from an ideal tune . if the radius is too small ( not enough deflection ), the dipole currents are increased by a scale factor proportional to the size of the deviation from an ideal tune . by going through each dub and scaling the dipole currents , a tune that is substantially flatter and closer to an ideal tune than the original tune may be obtained . the above process may be iterated ( rescan the multipin phantom 775 with the new tune , redo the multipin phantom 775 calibration , and re - correct the deflection buffers ) to produce a set of coil currents with a desired radial flatness . the angular motion of the electron beam may also be adjusted using information from the multipin phantom 775 . an optimal tune produces a beam spot that moves with a constant angular velocity . an initial tune may have angular accelerations and decelerations . deviations from the desired angular velocity may be flattened out on a dub - by - dub basis . each dub corresponds to a specified time ; hence the desired angular position of the beam spot for each dub is known . the actual angular position at a given time is contained in a beam spot position file calculated using the multipin phantom 775 . although the beam spot goes through all the correct angles , the beam spot may not be at the correct angle at the correct time . by searching through the existing dubs and beam spot position file , coil currents may be found that will place the electron beam at the desired position for any given dub . these currents are then interpolated and loaded into the dub that is being optimized . for example , assume that the dub at 25 milliseconds is the one being optimized . it may be that the desired location of the beam spot at this time is the 6 o &# 39 ; clock position . however , the actual beam spot may be at the 6 o &# 39 ; clock position at a different time , for example t = 24 . 985 ms . in that case , the coil currents in the two dubs spanning 24 . 985 ms would be linearly interpolated and placed in the dub at 25 ms . linear interpolation or combination will help ensure that the beam spot will be at the 6 o &# 39 ; clock position at 25 ms into the scan . linear combination is performed for every dub in the deflection buffer . through linear combination , the angular deviations are “ flattened ,” and a constant angular velocity is approached . in some embodiments , the flattening process is iterated to approach the desired angular velocity . physical limitations of the deflection coil 730 and focusing coil 720 and effects of the previously described radial modifications being performed along with the angular modifications may result in iteration . fig8 illustrates a flow diagram 800 for a method for adjusting an electron beam used in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . first , pin positions , detector element positions , and electron beam motion parameters are determined through estimation and refinement according to steps 310 - 370 described above . when detector element positions and electron beam motion have been computed , the electron beam may be adjusted as described below . electron beam and beam spot motion parameters , as well as other parameters , such as pin positions and detector element positions , may be stored in a file . at step 375 , the file , such as the beam spot motion file , may be loaded or retrieved in the system 700 for use in adjusting the electron beam . at step 380 , currents for the deflection coils 730 are loaded from a series of deflection update blocks ( dubs ). then , at step 385 , the radius of the electron beam spot is examined at the time of each dub . if the radius is too large ( indicating too much deflection , for example ), the dipole currents in the deflection coil are decreased by a scale factor proportional to the size of the deviation from an ideal coil current or tune . if the radius is too small ( indicating not enough deflection , for example ), the dipole currents are increased by a scale factor proportional to the size of the deviation from an ideal tune . next , at step 390 , dubs are adjusted to put the beam at a proper angle as a function of time . using the search and interpolation method described above , the coil currents are modified to make the beam spot sweep along the targets 140 - 143 with the correct constant angular velocity . finally , at step 395 , the adjusted coil current values are stored . the adjusted coil currents aim and focus the electron beam in the electromagnetic focusing coil 20 and deflection coils 730 to strike a desired position on the target rings 740 - 743 at a desired time . the above steps may be repeated as necessary to adjust the electron beam . while the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the scope of the invention . in addition , many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from its scope . therefore , it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed , but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims .",0
"referring particularly to fig1 - 3 , the chair base unit comprising the present invention essentially consists of an upper supporting plate 10 to which the seat , back and footrest unit of an operatory chair , such as dental chair , may be attached for support and also to be raised and lowered to a desired position by said base unit . said base unit also comprises a flat bottom plate 12 , which is adapted to rest upon a supporting surface such as a floor , and a base plate 14 , which is attached to bottom plate 12 by a short vertical pivot 16 , for rotation of the base plate 14 and all of the mechanism supported thereby relative to the bottom plate 12 . the mechanism for moving the upper plate 10 with respect to the base plate 14 comprises the subject matter of the present invention . specifically , as will be seen from fig1 - 3 , this mechanism comprises a pair of lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 which , as best seen from fig4 and 5 , are spaced transversely a substantial distance . each assembly , 18 and 20 , preferably comprises two pairs of crossed links 22 and 24 . each of said pairs of links 22 and 24 are pivotally connected intermediately of the ends thereof by appropriate pivot bolts 26 , which connect the upper pair of lazy tong links , and pivot bolts 28 connect the lower pair of such cross links . the lower ends of links 22 and 24 of the upper set are connected to the upper ends of said links of the lower set by additional pivot bolts 30 . the lower ends of links 24 of the lower set are pivotally connected by additional pivot bolts 32 to fixed brackets 34 , which are best shown in fig1 - 4 , the same being fixed to the upper surface of base plate 14 . correspondingly , the upper end of links 22 of the upper set are pivotally connected by additional pivot bolts 36 to brackets 38 , which are fixed to supporting plate 10 of the upper end of the base unit . the upper ends of links 24 of the upper set preferably have an anti - friction roller 40 fixed thereto for longitudinal movement within a guide channel 42 , one of such channels being disposed adjacent each side edge of the upper supporting plate 10 , as shown in fig1 - 3 and particularly in fig5 . for purposes of bracing the transversely spaced parallel sets of lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 against lateral skewing movement or any other type of transverse movement between the upper supporting plate 10 and the base plate 14 , appropriate brace members are connected to the various links of the lazy tong assemblies . as best shown in fig5 a transverse brace bar 44 is welded at its opposite ends respectively to the upper ends of links 24 of the upper set thereof , the position of said brace bar also being illustrated in fig1 - 3 . another , somewhat u - shaped transverse brace bar 46 , extends between the lower ends of links 22 of the lower set thereof . further , still another transverse brace bar 48 , best shown in fig1 and 4 , extends between the terminal upper end of links 22 of the lower set thereof , it being understood that fig4 is an end view of the base unit as seen from the left end of fig1 . in fig4 the transverse brace bar 48 obscures a cylindrical brace bar 50 , which extends between the lower ends of the links 22 of the upper set thereof , as best shown in fig5 in which the cylindrical brace bar 50 obscures the transverse brace bar 48 , which is at the opposite end of the base from the cylindrical brace bar 50 . further , the brace bar 50 may either be tubular or solid , and in any event , the pivot bolts 30 preferably are threaded into tapped holes in the opposite ends of the cylindrical brace bar 50 . it readily can be visualized from the foregoing that the linkage structure is amply braced against lateral , skewing or slanting movement with respect to a vertical plane extending from the base of the unit and disposed between the vertically spaced sets of lazy tong assemblies . all of the various ends of the links of the several sets of lazy tong assemblies have been accounted for in the foregoing with the exception of the lower ends of links 22 of the lower set thereof . as best shown in fig6 however , there is secured to base plate 14 outwardly from the lower ends of links 22 of the lower set , a pair of guide channels 52 , which are horizontal and open faces thereof are disposed inwardly toward each other respectively for the reception of anti - friction guide members 54 . in operation , the guide members 54 and the anti - fraction rollers 40 simply move longitudinally within their respective guide channels 52 and 42 , respectively , at the lower and upper ends of the base unit as the lazy tong assemblies respectively are expanded and contracted simultaneously to raise and lower the upper supporting plate 10 . hence , it will be seen that rigid transverse brace members 44 , 46 , 48 and 50 provide stability for the lazy tong assemblies to resist swaying or skewing in one transverse direction , whereas the pivot bolts 36 and anti - friction followers 40 at the upper end of the lazy tong assemblies , together with the pivot bolts 32 and anti - friction guide or follower members 54 at the lower ends of said lazy tong assemblies provide resistance to swaying or skewing of the lazy tong assemblies in a lateral direction transverse to the direction against which said rigid bracing members resist swaying or skewing . the prime mover in the power mechanism by which the lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 are expanded and contracted simultaneously comprises , preferably , an electric motor 56 of fractional horsepower rating , such as of the order of 1 / 8 horsepower , but such rating is not to be regarded as restrictive . however , because of the linkage mechanism , drive screw and other details of the power system which are described hereinafter , it will be seen that the base comprising the present invention for supporting , raising and lowering seat and back means connected thereto is very efficient and economical from the standpoint of power consumption . as shown in fig1 - 3 , motor 56 is enclosed within a suitable housing 58 to provide suitable aesethics for that portion of the base . also , the drive shaft of the motor 56 is connected to a gear reduction unit 60 which has an output drive shaft 62 . mounted on the outer end of drive shaft 62 is a drive sprocket 64 around which a sprocket chain 66 extends , the same also extending around a driven sprocket gear 68 , see fig6 which is fixed to one end of drive screw 70 . drive screw 70 preferably is of the acme type and extends through a transverse yoke 72 which has a central threaded bore complementary to screw 70 . it is to be noted from fig1 - 3 that the screw 70 is substantially horizontal and parallel to base plate 14 and , from fig6 it will be seen that said screw is substantially centrally between lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 . opposite ends of the screw 70 are respectively rotatably supported within appropriate bearing blocks 74 and 76 . a pair of parallel connecting rods 78 are pivotally connected at one end to opposite ends of the transverse yoke 72 , as clearly shown in fig6 and the opposite ends are pivotally connected to one end 80 of a bell crank unit comprising a pair of similar bell crank members 82 , the shape of which is best shown in fig1 - 3 . the bell crank members 82 readily may be formed from metal plate stock and the intermediate portion of each of said members 82 has a boss 84 connected thereto , such as by welding . said intermediate portions and bosses 84 are bored respectively to receive the opposite ends of a transverse supporting shaft 86 . the opposite terminal ends of shaft 86 extend through complementary holes formed in the upper ends of a pair of similar vertical plates which jointly comprise a composite pivot member 88 which is rigidly connected to and supported by base plate 14 . the opposite or upper ends 90 of bell crank members 82 are connected by pivots 92 respectively to one end of each of a pair of connecting links 94 . the opposite ends of connecting links 94 are pivotally connected to pivot bolts 28 , which also interconnect the lower pair of crossed links 22 and 24 of each of the lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 . the electric motor 56 is of the reversible type and is controlled by suitable switch means , not shown , which , for example , preferably are mounted upon the back of a chair seat when supported by the upper supporting plate 10 . however , the present invention also contemplates foot - operated switch members which are illustrated in fig6 and comprise pedals 96 . referring to fig7 it will be seen that a conduit 98 extends from a suitable source of current , not shown , and is positioned beneath the bottom plate 12 within suitable space therein provided for such conduit , said conduit leading to a terminal board 100 , shown in fig6 . said terminal board preferably is enclosed within the housing 58 and appropriate circuit control means , such as relays and the like , not shown , also are included within said terminal board 100 . a circuit also extends between the switches 102 , which are actuated by the foot pedals 98 and the motor 56 . any additional manually operable switch means , such as those referred to above as being on the back of a chair seat likewise are connected by appropriate circuitry , not shown , to the terminal board 100 . it is to be understood that all of such circuitry is relatively simple and of conventional nature and actually does not comprise part of the novelty of the present invention . for purposes of concealing the lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 and the mechanism by which the same are actuated , the chair base comprising the present invention is provided with an accordian type flexible cover 102 , which is expansible and contractable vertically . the cover extends entirely around the circumference of the upper supporting plate 10 and the upper end of said cover is clamped to the periphery of said supporting plate by a flanged clamping member 104 , which surrounds said upper end of cover 102 and any suitable means such as screws or otherwise , not shown , are employed to clamp said upper end of cover 102 to the upper supporting plate 10 . similarly , a stiff shroud 106 , which may be formed from metal , molded from plastic or a rigid nature , or otherwise , surrounds the lower portion of the operating mechanism for the lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 . said shroud , at the forward end of the base unit , interfits with housing 58 that encloses the electric motor 56 and otherwise is suitably secured to the base plate 14 so as to be movable therewith when the same is rotated about the pivot 16 with respect to the flat bottom plate 12 . the lower end of flexible cover 102 also is clamped to an inwardly extending flange 108 on the upper edge of shroud 106 by means of another flanged clamping member 110 which extends around the inner periphery of flange 108 and is secured thereto with the rim of the flexible cover 102 sandwiched therebetween by the use of screws , not shown , or any other suitable means . as described above , the lazy tong assemblies 18 and 20 , the upper supporting plate 10 and all of the operating mechanism for the lazy tong assemblies are mounted upon base plate 14 for support . said base plate and all of the mechanism mounted thereon is movable about the vertical pivot 16 with respect to the flat bottom plate 12 . such movement of the base plate 14 is facilitated by the provision of a plurality of anti - friction rollers 112 , which are positioned within suitable notches formed in the periphery of base plate 14 as best shown in fig6 and 7 . the rollers 112 operate upon a smooth area in the upper face of the flat bottom plate 12 . from fig1 it will be seen that the flat bottom plate 12 preferably is provided with a circular recess 114 in the upper surface thereof which receives the base plate 14 and the upper surface of the flat bottom plate 12 , which extends outwardly from the periphery of circular recess 114 , slopes downwardly around all edges of the plate 12 to prevent accidental tripping of an operator upon the outer periphery of said flat bottom plate 12 . after the base plate 14 has been disposed in a desired rotary position with respect to the flat bottom plate 12 , it is locked in said position by a relatively simple but effective locking means in the nature of a brake unit 116 . details of said brake unit 116 are best illustrated in fig6 - 9 , and the details thereof are as follows : a bridging plate 118 is secured by suitable screws 120 , see fig8 to a supporting block 122 , which is connected by additional screws 124 to base plate 14 . a shaft 126 extends through suitable bearings in the outer flange 128 and supporting block 122 , said shaft extending beyond both of said bearings . a foot treadle 131 is secured to the forward end of shaft 126 . the opposite end of shaft 126 is received within a suitable bearing hole in another supporting block 130 , which is fixed by welding within a suitable recess 132 formed within the base plate 14 . also supported within the recess 132 is a slide 134 which , on the inner end thereof has a cam surface 136 . the outer end of slide 134 has a brake block 137 of friction material fixed thereto for engagement with the wall of circulr recess 114 in the flat bottom plate 12 , as clearly shown in fig8 and 9 . slide 134 is guided for radial movement within recess 132 by a suitable channeled bracket 138 , the outer ears of which overlie the top surface of base plate 14 , as clearly shown in fig9 and are secured to said surface by appropriate screws . adjustably mounted upon the shaft 126 between the supporting blocks 122 and 130 is a cam actuator comprising a head 139 , see fig8 secured by a set screw to the shaft . the head 139 has a small shaft projecting therefrom which rotatably supports a roller 140 which , as best shown in fig9 engages cam surface 136 when the end 142 of foot treadle 131 is depressed . following the initial engagement of the end 142 of foot treadle 131 by the foot of the operator , continued movement of said end 142 will cause the roller 140 to move from the full line position thereof shown in fig9 to the dotted line position , and such movement causes the brake block 137 to be moved into firm frictional engagement with the vertical wall of the circular recess 114 in flat bottom plate 12 , and thereby lock the base plate 14 against any further rotation with respect to the flat bottom plate 12 . when the roller 140 is in the dotted line position thereof shown in fig9 it abuts the flat transverse end 144 of slide 134 and when in this position , it will automatically be retained therein until the opposite end of the foot treadle 131 is depressed , whereby such movement will restore the roller 140 to the full line position thereof shown in fig9 and thereby unlatch the brake block 137 so as to free the base plate 14 for rotation , when desired . from fig8 it also will be seen that a screw 146 is threaded into supporting block 130 coaxially with the socket therein which receives one end of shaft 126 . the inner end of screw 146 abuts said socketed end of shaft 126 and thereby assures effective operation of the cam - actuating roller 140 , since the screw 146 prevents axial movement of the shaft 126 toward the right as viewed in fig8 . therefore , it will be seen that the chair base comprising the present invention includes a simple but effective mechanism for locking and unlocking the base plate 14 and the mechanism supported thereby against rotation relative to the recess 114 within which base plate 14 is positioned relative to flat bottom plate 12 . from the foregoing , it will be seen that the present invention provides a chair base which is capable of elevating and lowering an operatory chair seat and back , such as those commonly used in detail operatories and other similar uses in the medical profession such as ophthalmology and other areas of the medical profession . the lazy tong mechanism is of such nature that it permits the seat of a chair to be extended to a very low position and the compact arrangement of the operating mechanism for the lazy tong systems also has been designed to achieve this advantageous result . the pair of lazy tong systems which are disposed in transversely spaced relationship are adequately braced to prevent swaying or canting of the seat and back when supported by said base . further , the elevation of the seat from its lowest position occurs smoothly and gently due to the particular linkage and bell crank arrangment which actuates the lazy tong system . further , substantial mechanical advantage is provided to effect such raising and lowering of a chair seat by said base , whereby a relatively low - powered electric motor is fully capable of effecting such raising and lowering of a chair seat and back by said base . further , all of the lazy tong systems and the power mechanism to expand and contract the same is enclosed within attractive expansible cover means and all of said mechanism is rotatable upon a bottom plate which rests upon a supporting surface , such as a floor and , following a rotation of the chair base unit relative to said bottom plate , effective brake means are provided to secure said rotatable base unit in a desired position upon said bottom plate . while the invention has been described and illustrated in its several preferred embodiments , it should be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the precise details herein illustrated and described since the same may be carried out in other ways falling within the scope of the invention as illustrated and described .",1
"please refer to fig1 , which is a function block diagram of a chip 10 and a circuit board 12 , both of which are installed in a micro - controller system , according to the present invention . the circuit board 12 , for example , is a motherboard and the chip 10 is a chip installed on the motherboard . the circuit board 12 can also be a printed circuit board with an add - on card installed and the chip 10 is for controlling the add - on card . the chip 10 comprises an i / o circuit 16 and a core circuit 14 for data calculation and information manipulation . the i / o circuit 16 buffers and transforms both data manipulated by the core circuit 14 and data ready to be transmitted to the circuit board 12 and raw data ready to be transmitted to the core circuit through the circuit board 12 . as described previously , the core circuit 14 is biased by a low - leveled voltage and generates low - leveled data and signals of low levels , which are to be pumped by the i / o circuit 16 and then to be transmitted to the circuit board 12 . on the contrary , the i / o circuit 16 reduces the voltage of both raw data and signals ready to be transmitted from the circuit board 12 to the core circuit . since the i / o circuit 16 is designed to exchange data with the circuit board 12 and vice versa , bias voltages to bias the i / o circuit 16 and the circuit board 12 are of equal levels . the circuit board 12 and the i / o circuit 16 of the chip 10 are biased by two distinct direct voltages vcc and vss ( can be referred as ground ) respectively . since the core circuit 14 needs a low - leveled voltage as a bias voltage , the chip 10 has to combine with the circuit board 12 to form a regulator 18 to generate a regulated voltage vp 25 to bias the core circuit 14 . typically , the circuit board 12 provides the chip 10 with a direct voltage of 3 . 3 volts , while the bias voltage to bias the core circuit 14 is of 2 . 5 volts . for such a configuration , the regulator 18 generates the regulated voltage vp 25 , capable of providing power for the core circuit 14 to operate , with the direct voltage vcc of 3 . 3 volts . in the regulator 18 , a bipolar junction transistor qp 1 , which is installed on the circuit board 12 , functions as a charging circuit to provide currents . a capacitor cp 1 functions as a power module 24 . in accordance with the transistor qp 1 and the power module 24 , the chip 10 comprises an operational amplifier 20 , a bandgap circuit 22 for generating a bandgap voltage vbg 0 , and two voltage - dividing resistors rp 0 and rp 1 . a bias voltage , whose level is between the direct voltages vcc and vss , biases the regulator 18 . the operational amplifier 20 has two differential input ends , labeled by “+” and “−” and connected to node np 1 and to a bandgap voltage output end of the bandgap circuit 22 respectively . an output end op 0 of the operational amplifier 20 is electrically connected to a base of the transistor qp 1 for biasing the base of the transistor qp 1 with a driving voltage as a driving signal . in operation , the chip 10 can connect the output end op 0 to the transistor qp 1 of the circuit board 12 with a pin . the direct voltage vcc biases an emitter of the transistor qp 1 . a collector of the transistor qp 1 is electrically connected to the power module 24 at node np 0 . the power module 24 comprises a capacitor of high capacitance for voltage regulation and bypassing the interference of alternative fluctuation as well . the capacitor can be charged to a stable state and generates the regulated voltage vp 25 at node np 0 . the regulated voltage vp 25 of the power module 24 at node np 0 can be transmitted back to the chip 10 through another corresponding pin . the regulated voltage vp 25 not only provides the core circuit 14 with the biased voltage , it also generates a divided voltage vs 0 at node np 1 through the use of the resistors rp 0 and rp 1 . after comparing the bandgap voltage vbg 0 with the direct voltage vs 0 , the operational amplifier 20 generates a driving voltage vd 0 to control the transistor qp 1 . operations of the regulator 18 are described as follows : when the circuit board 12 enables the chip 10 to start to function , the circuit board 12 provides the regulator 18 with the direct voltage vcc to enable the regulator 18 to function . in the meantime , the operational amplifier 20 also starts to compare a voltage vs 0 at node np 1 with the bandgap voltage vbg 0 generated by the bandgap circuit 22 . since node np 0 and the voltage vs 0 both are kept at low level before the regulator 18 functions , as the operational amplifier 20 starts to function , the operational amplifier 20 outputs the driving voltage vd 0 of a low level at the output end op 0 due to a comparison result that the voltage vs 0 is far smaller than the bandgap voltage vbg 0 . in the mean time , a voltage across the emitter and base of the transistor qp 1 is almost equal to a voltage difference between the direct voltages vcc and vss , enabling the transistor qp 1 to generate a high - leveled current ic 0 as a charging current to charge the high - capacitanced capacitors cp 1 of the power module 24 . as the charging process keeps functioning , the voltages at node np 0 as well as at node np 1 are increasing and the operational amplifier 20 keeps increasing the driving voltage vd 0 at the output end op 0 . the degree to which the driving voltage vd 0 is increased corresponds to the degree to which a voltage across the emitter and base of the transistor qp 1 is decreased , enabling the transistor qp 1 to conduct lesser currents . the operational amplifier 20 is capable of controlling the driving voltage vd 0 by detecting the voltage vs 0 and stabling the voltage vp 25 at node np 0 . after reaching to the stable state , the operational amplifier 20 keeps the voltage vs 0 to be equal to the bandgap voltage vbg 0 . that is , the voltage vp 25 is equal to ( 1 + rp 0 / rp 1 ) vbg 0 . such the stable voltage vp 25 can function as the direct biased voltage for the core circuit 14 . the current for the core circuit 14 to operate is therefore supplied by the transistor qp 1 . occasionally , when the voltage vp 25 is changed , the operational amplifier 20 accordingly controls the driving voltage vd 0 to be dynamically compensated . for example , if the core circuit 14 needs more current due to an increment of calculation , the capacitor cp 2 is capable of preventing the voltage vp 25 at node np 0 from dropping abruptly . the voltage vp 25 of a slightly reduced level enables the voltage vs 0 to drop accordingly and a voltage across the emitter and base of the transistor qp 1 to rise , thus increasing currents ic 0 flowing through the transistor qp 1 to meet the demand of increasing currents for the core circuit 14 . however , although the regulator 18 shown in fig1 can generate the stable voltage vp 25 to bias the core circuit 14 , the regulator 18 has a problem that the regulator 18 actuates too great currents to flow through the transistor qp 1 in the beginning , the too great currents probably burning the transistor qp 1 . as described previously , when the regulator 18 starts to operate , voltage at node np 0 has a low level and the driving voltage vd 0 output by the operational amplifier 20 at the output end op 0 also has a low level . therefore , a voltage across the emitter and base of the transistor q 1 is almost equal to a voltage difference , 3 . 3 volts for example , between the direct voltages vcc and vss . however , the level of the voltage across the emitter and base of the transistor q 1 for the transistor q 1 to actuate a significant current is generally equal to 0 . 7 to 0 . 8 volts . theefore , the current actuated by the regulator in the beginning of operation is in fact greater than a current for the transistor qp 1 to operate normally dramatically . such a high - leveled current probably burns the transistor qp 1 while the regulator 18 is in the beginning of operation . accordingly , the present invention also presents an amended regulator . please refer to fig2 , which is a function block diagram of a regulator 38 fabricated between a chip 30 and a circuit board 32 according to the present invention . in accordance with allocation of modern microprocessor , the chip 30 also comprises a core circuit 34 and an i / o circuit 36 , the core circuit 34 operating at the voltage v 25 of a lower level , and the i / o circuit 36 as well as the circuit board 32 biased by the direct voltage vcc of a higher level . the direct bias vss can be ground of zero volts . in order to generate the regulated voltage v 25 for the core circuit 34 , a regulator 38 is fabricated between the chip 30 and the circuit board 32 for generating the regulated voltage v 25 according to the direct bias vcc provided by the circuit board 32 . the regulator 38 is biased by a voltage between the direct bias vcc and vss . the regulator 38 comprises a bandgap voltage generator 42 fabricated in the chip 30 for generating a bandgap voltage vbg , an operational amplifier 40 , a control circuit 48 , a mos transistor q 3 functioning as a charge circuit , and two voltage - dividing resistors r 0 and r 1 . in accordance with the above circuit , the circuit board 32 also comprises a bjt q 1 and a power module 46 for providing currents and appropriate reduced voltage . the operational amplifier 40 comprises a positive input end inp electrically connected to node n 1 , a negative input end inn for receiving the bandgap voltage vbg , and an output end op . in operation , the operational amplifier 40 generates a corresponding driving voltage vd as a driving signal at the output end op by referring by referring a voltage difference between the positive and negative input ends inp and inn . the driving voltage vd is for controlling a base of the transistor q 1 . in practice , the chip 30 can comprises a pin to electrically connect the output end op to the base of the transistor q 1 , whose emitter is biased by the direct voltage vcc and a collector is electrically connected to node n 0 . based on the control of the driving voltage vd , the transistor q 1 is capable of providing a charging current ic to flow to node n 0 . the power module 46 comprises a capacitor c 1 of high capacitance for voltage regulation and bypassing unnecessary interference , enabling a voltage at node n 0 to be stable . with the power module 46 as a load , the regulator 38 is capable of generating the regulated voltage v 25 at node n 0 . the regulated voltage v 25 at node n 0 can be transmitted back to the core circuit 34 for biasing the core circuit 34 by connecting node n 0 through another pin in the chip 30 to a node n 3 of the chip 30 . the resistors r 0 and r 1 are capable of generating a dividing voltage vs , equal to ( r 1 /( r 0 + r 1 )) v 25 , at node n 1 and transmitting the dividing voltage vs to the positive input end inp of the operational amplifier 40 . in the present invention , the control circuit 48 generates voltage signals vpc , vop and vopb as control signals . the transistor q 3 , as a pre - charging circuit , comprises a drain biased by the direct voltage vcc , a body biased by the direct voltage vss , a gate controlled by the voltage vpc , and a source electrically connected to node n 3 . with the above connection , the transistor q 3 is capable of generating a pre - charging current to flow to node n 3 based on the control of the control circuit 48 . the operational amplifier 40 , controlled by the voltage vop as well as vopb , selectably either disables the operational amplifier 40 to stop functioning or enables the operational amplifier 40 to start to function . in the preferred embodiment of the present invention , when the operational amplifier 40 is disabled , the operational amplifier 40 continuously outputs a high - leveled voltage ( that is the direct voltage vcc ) at the output end op to turn off the transistor q 1 . when the operational amplifier 40 is enabled , the operational amplifier 40 generates the corresponding driving voltage vd at the output end op by referring a voltage difference between the positive and negative input ends inp and inn . in accordance with the above allocation , the regulator 38 functions as following descriptions . in the beginning , the circuit board 32 provides the chip 30 and the regulator 38 with the direct voltage vcc . in the meantime , the control circuit 48 disables the operational amplifier 40 with the voltages vop and vopb . as described previously , the disabled operational amplifier 40 outputs the driving voltage of a high level at the output end op and disables the transistor q 1 to actuate currents because of a voltage of substantial zero volts between the emitter and base of the transistor q 1 . while the operational amplifier 40 is disabling , the control circuit 48 controls the transistor q 3 with the voltage vpc of a high level to provide the pre - charging charge ipc to flow through nodes n 3 and n 0 and charge the power module 46 . in other words , at this moment the pre - charge current ipc for charging the power module 46 is not generated by the transistor q 1 , but by the transistor q 3 instead . as the transistor q 3 keeps charging the power module 46 , the regulated voltage v 25 at node n 0 rises from a voltage of a low - level ( equal to the level of the direct voltage vss ), and the control circuit 48 keeps estimating how high the regulated voltage v 25 has risen until the control circuit 48 estimates that the regulated voltage v 25 has risen to a voltage equal to a predetermined voltage . in the preferred embodiment of the present invention , the predetermined voltage is a voltage whose level is slightly lower than that of the regulated voltage v 25 . as soon as the control circuit 48 has estimated that the regulated voltage v 25 has risen to the predetermined voltage , the control circuit 48 changes levels of the voltage signals vop , vopb and vpc , enables the operational amplifier 40 , and turns off the transistor q 3 not to provide the pre - charging current ipc . after starting to function , the operational amplifier 40 generates the corresponding driving voltage vd by referring a voltage difference between the voltage vs and the bandgap voltage vbg and controls the transistor q 1 to actuate the charging current ic to charge the power module 46 . eventually , the operational amplifier 40 keeps the regulated voltage v 25 to have a stable level equal to ( 1 + r 0 / r 1 ) vbg . from the above descriptions , when the regulator 38 begins to function and the regulated voltage v 25 is equal to zero volts , the regulator 38 disables the feedback control between the operational amplifier 40 and the transistor q 1 , preventing the operational amplifier 40 from excessively driving the transistor q 1 because of too high a voltage difference between the voltage vs and the bandgap voltage vbg . when disabling the operational amplifier 40 , the regulator 38 provides the pre - charging current ipc with the transistor q 3 , served as a pre - charging circuit , to flow to the power module 46 and to charge the capacitors c 1 and c 2 , raising the regulated voltage v 25 at node n 0 . as soon as the regulated voltage v 25 is raised to the predetermined voltage , the control circuit 48 controls the transistor q 3 with the signal vpc not to actuate and to stop providing the pre - charging current ipc . the control circuit 48 , in the meantime , enables the operational amplifier 40 with the signals vop and vopb , enabling the feedback control between the operational amplifier 40 and the transistor q 1 and stabilizing the regulated voltage v 25 . that is , while the operational amplifier 40 is functioning , the regulated voltage v 25 is not a low - leveled voltage any more and the voltage vs is becoming closer and closer to the bandgap voltage vgp , enabling the operational amplifier 40 to output the driving voltage vd of a level higher than that of the low - leveled voltage . therefore , as the driving voltage vd actuates the transistor q 1 , a problem of too low a voltage between the emitter and base can be approved and the transistor q 1 will not be exceedingly driven to actuate too great a current . fig3 is a circuit diagram of a practical embodiment of the operational amplifier 40 according to the present invention . fig4 is a circuit of a practical embodiment of the control circuit 48 according to the present invention . as shown in fig3 , the operational amplifier 40 is biased by voltages ranging between the direct voltages vcc and vss and is composed of nmos transistors t 1 , t 2 , t 5 to t 8 , t 12 and t 14 and pmos transistors t 3 , t 4 , t 9 to t 11 and t 13 . nmos transistors s 1 to s 3 and s 7 and pmos transistors s 4 and s 5 are functioned as switch transistors for the need to enabling or disabling the operational amplifier 40 . each of the nmos transistors comprises a body biased by the direct voltage vss . each of the pmos transistors also comprises a body biased by the direct voltage vcc . the transistors t 1 and t 2 form a differential pair . the transistors t 1 and t 2 comprise respective gates , serving as the positive and negative input ends of the operational amplifier 40 . the transistor t 5 , connected to the differential pair at node n 5 and serving as a current source for bias , comprises a gate electrically connected to gates of the transistors t 6 , t 7 and t 14 to form a current mirror . a support circuit 50 , capable of generating a current ir to serve as a reference current , adjusts a level of a bias voltage at node t 5 through the use of the current mirror . the transistors t 3 and t 4 function as active loads of the differential pair . the transistors t 3 and t 4 comprise respective gates connected to gates of the transistors t 9 and t 11 and form another current mirror . in summary , the transistors t 1 and t 5 form a differential input stage of the operational amplifier 40 . signals amplified by the differential input stage are further amplified by a second stage , including the transistors t 6 to t 11 , of the operational amplifier 40 . the operational amplifier 40 has the transistors t 12 and t 13 as a class ab output stage and node n 8 as the output end op . in contrast to the transistors t 1 to t 14 , which form a basic structure of the operational amplifier 40 , the switch transistors s 1 to s 7 control biases applied to the gates of the transistors t 1 to t 14 and enables or disables the operational amplifier 40 . the transistors s 1 , s 2 and s 7 have gates controlled by the signal vop generated by the control circuit 48 , please further refer to fig2 , while the transistors s 3 to s 5 have gates controlled by the signal vopb . operations for the operational amplifier 40 to disable or enable by referring by referring the signals vop and vopb are described as follows : when disabling the operational amplifier 40 , the control circuit sets the signals vop and vopb to have a high and low level respectively , conducting the switch transistors s 1 to s 7 . conducted transistors s 1 and s 3 reduce a voltage at node n 6 to a voltage equal to the direct voltage vss , turning off the transistors t 5 to t 7 and t 14 and enabling the current ir generated by the support circuit 50 to flow into the conducted transistor q 3 instead of the transistor q 14 . likewise , conducted transistors s 2 and s 7 pull voltages at the gates of the transistors tb and t 12 down to a voltage equal to the direct voltage vss and turn off the transistors t 8 and t 12 accordingly . the transistor t 10 is actuated . conducted transistors s 4 and s 5 pull voltages at the gates of the transistors t 3 , t 4 , t 9 and t 11 up to a voltage equal to the direct voltage vcc and turn off these four transistors . the actuated transistor t 10 combined with the turned off transistor t 11 are capable of pulling a voltage at the gate of the transistor t 13 down to a voltage of a low level , turning on the transistor t 13 , and pulling a voltage ( the driving voltage shown in fi . 2 ) at the output end op up to a voltage equal to the direct voltage vcc . when the regulator 38 just starts operating , the operational amplifier 40 is disabled and the high - leveled driving voltage vd at the output end makes a voltage difference between the emitter and the base of the transistor q 1 neglected and turns off the transistor q 1 . in contrast , when enabling the operational amplifier 40 , the control circuit 48 pulls the voltage vop up to a voltage of a high level and the voltage vopb down to a voltage of a low level . the transistors s 1 to s 7 are then turned off from affecting biases applied to the gates of the transistors t 1 to t 14 , the transistors t 1 to t 14 then capable of executing normal functions that the operational amplifier 40 has , generating the corresponding driving voltage vd at the output end op by referring by referring a voltage difference between the positive and negative input ends inp and inn . as shown in fig4 , the control circuit 48 of the present invention comprises nmos transistors m 1 to m 3 , m 5 , m 6 , m 9 to m 11 , pmos transistors m 4 , m 7 and m 8 , and an inverter 52 and a nor gate 54 , both of which are biased by voltages ranging between the direct voltage vcc and vss . each of the pmos transistors has a body biased by the direct voltage vcc , while each of the nmos has a body biased by the direct voltage vss . the transistors m 1 to m 3 have respective gates all electrically connected to the direct voltage vcc for forming an internal pre - charging circuit 56 , which is electrically connected to a gate of the transistor m 6 at node n 9 . the transistor m 6 further comprises a drain and a source , both of which are biased by the direct voltage vss and form a capacitor as a second power module . the internal pre - charging circuit 56 is capable of charging the capacitor formed by the transistor m 6 and generating a voltage v 2 at node n 9 . the transistors m 7 , m 9 and m 10 are connected to form a circuit of an inverter , receiving the voltage v 2 as an input voltage with the gate and outputting the voltage vpc for the control circuit 48 to control the transistor q 3 at node 10 , please further refer to fig5 . through the use of the nor gate 54 and the inverter 52 , the control circuit 48 is capable of generating another two control signals vop and vopb with the voltage vpc to enable or disable the operational amplifier 40 . please refer to fig5 , which is a timing diagram of voltages at corresponding nodes of the regulator 38 in operation according to the present invention , an abscissa representing time and an ordinate representing levels of the voltages . in fig5 , solid lines from top to bottom represent the regulated voltage v 25 , a voltage vreg , the voltage v 2 in the control circuit 48 , as shown in fig4 , and the signals vpc , vop and vopb for the control circuit 48 to control the transistor q 3 and the operational amplifier 40 . in following paragraph fig5 will be used to illustrate operations of the control circuit 48 and the regulator 38 as well . as shown in fig5 , it is assumed that the circuit board 32 enables the chip 30 to start to operate at time t0 . as described previously , at this moment the circuit board 32 begins to provide the regulator 38 with the direct voltage vcc . at time t0 the voltage vreg of a low level enables the transistors m 4 and mb ( referring to fig4 ) to be turned on and the transistors m 5 and m 11 to be turned off . in the meantime , the internal pre - charging circuit 56 begins to actuate a current ipc 2 as a second pre - charging current to flow to the gate of the transistor q 6 through node n 9 due to the bias the direct voltage vcc , like charging the capacitor formed by the transistor q 6 and raising the voltage v 2 at node n 9 for a voltage of a low level . however , a voltage at node n 9 at time t0 is still a low - leveled voltage , which turns on the transistor m 7 and turns off the transistors m 9 and m 10 , pulling the voltage vpc at node n 10 as well as the voltage vop up to voltages of high levels . the inverter 52 of the control circuit 48 pulls the signal vopb down to a voltage of a low level . as described previously , the high - leveled voltage vpx turns on the transistor q 3 and enables the transistor q 3 to actuate the pre - charging current ipc to charge the power module 46 and to raise the voltage v 25 . in the meantime , the signal vop has a high level and the signal vopb has a low level , enabling the operational amplifier 40 to be disabled and to output the driving voltage vd of a high level at the output end op to turn off the transistor q 1 ( referring to fig2 , fig3 , and corresponding descriptions ). as shown in fig5 , as the internal pre - charging circuit 56 charges the transistor m 6 at time t0 , the voltage v 2 at node n 9 starts to rise from a voltage of a low level and eventually reaches to a voltage great enough to turn off the transistor m 7 and to turn on the transistors m 9 and m 10 , thus reducing the high - leveled voltage vpc at time t0 to the voltage vpc of a low level at time t1 , reducing the high - leveled voltage vop to the voltage vop of a low level , and raising the low - leveled voltage vopb at time t1 to the voltage vopb of a high level . moreover , from the time t0 to t1 , not only does the internal pre - charging circuit 56 of the control circuit 48 charge the capacitor formed by the transistor q 6 , the transistor q 3 , as a pre - charging circuit , of the regulator 38 also charges the capacitors c 1 and c 2 of the power module 46 , raising the regulated voltage v 25 at node n 0 from the time to on . up to time t1 , the regulated voltage v 25 has been raised to a voltage of a level equal to a voltage level v 25 m . since the voltages vpc , vop and vopb at time t1 have changed , the transistor q 3 is then turned off and stops actuating the pre - charging current ipc . the operational amplifier 40 begins to operate after time t1 and adjusts the driving voltage vd to drive the transistor q 1 to charge the power module 46 , raising the driving voltage vd after time t1 until that the driving voltage vd is stable . the stable driving voltage vs is equal to ( 1 + r 0 / r 1 ) vbg . for example , the stable driving voltage vs is 2 . 5 volts . the stable driving voltage vs can then used for the operations of the core circuit 34 . it is apparent from the previous descriptions that when the operational amplifier 40 and the transistor q 1 begin to operate , the regulated voltage v 25 is generated by the transistor q 3 in the pre - charging circuit from time t0 to t1 , from a voltage of a low level at time t0 to a voltage equal to the voltage v 25 m at time t1 . the operational amplifier 40 drives the transistor q 1 at time t1 with the regulated voltage v 25 instead of the driving voltage vd of a low level and prevents the transistor q 1 from burning out due to too great a current . additionally , it can be seen in fig5 that the sooner the voltage vc 2 of the control circuit 48 is changed , the earlier the operational amplifier 40 as well as the transistor q 1 begin to operate . for example , if the voltage vc 2 changes in accordance with a dotted curve vc 2 p , at time tp the voltage vc 2 rises to a voltage to enable the voltages vpc and vop to be reduced and the voltage vopb to be increased . therefore , as the regulated voltage v 25 is raised to be equal the stable regulated voltage v 25 mp , the regulated voltage v 25 is then made stable by the operational amplifier 40 and the transistor q 1 . in other words , in order to control the transistors q 3 and q 1 capable of operating sequentially when the regulated voltage v 25 is raised to be equal to a predetermined voltage , the internal pre - charging circuit 56 of the control circuit 48 can be controlled to adjust the speed to charge the transistor m 6 , the transistor q 3 charging the power module 46 to a voltage equal to the predetermined voltage when the voltage vc 2 is raised to a voltage whose level is high enough to trigger the voltages vpc , vop and vopb to change . moreover , the transistor m 6 and currents actuated by the internal pre - charging circuit 56 can be adjusted to adjust the speed for the internal charging circuit 56 to charge the transistor m 6 . for example , if the current ipc 2 actuated by the pre - charging circuit 56 is equal to one - tenth of the pre - charging current ipc flowing through the transistor q 3 , and the equivalent capacitance of the transistor m 6 is also equal to one - tenth of the equivalent capacitance of the power module 46 , the voltage vpc 2 will rise as fast as the regulated voltage v 25 when the transistor q 3 is in operation . therefore , the rising speed for the voltage vpc 2 can be used to estimate the rising speed for the voltage v 25 and the timing for the transistors q 3 and q 1 to operate sequentially . in contrast to the prior art , the present invention can provide a regulator capable of providing a stable and concise regulated voltage in a feedback control manner . in the prototype regulator , since the operational amplifier controls the bjt transistor qp 1 to operate according to a low - leveled regulated voltage in the beginning and drives the transistor qp 1 exceedingly , the transistor qp 1 is easily burned - out , disabling the regulator to generate the regulated voltage and preventing the core circuit of the chip from getting the bias voltage and operating . in the present invention , the transistor q 3 functions as a pre - charging circuit and raises the regulated voltage to a voltage equal to a predetermined voltage prior to the operations of the operational amplifier and the bjt transistor q 1 , preventing the transistor q 1 from burning out due to too great driving currents to drive the transistor q 1 after the operational amplifier starts to function , allowing the regulator to function normally thereafter , and ensuring that the core circuit can obtain the concise and stable bias voltage . following the detailed description of the present invention above , those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention . accordingly , the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims .",6

shaped as are the longitudinal edges 62 & amp ; 62 &# 39 ; of webs 52 . the inside panel members 40b differ from the inside panel members 40a because they include screw holes h and the longitudinal edges 63 and 63 &# 39 ; are less extended from the elements 54 and 58 than are the edges 62 and 62 &# 39 ;. actually , the members 40a and 40b could be identical , but the difference in the edges 63 & amp ; 63 &# 39 ; vs . 62 & amp ; 62 &# 39 ; save metal or other material from which the members 40b are constructed . the leg elements 56 are set back from the respective longitudinal edges 60 of webs 50 an appreciable distance as are lug elements 58 from the longitudinal edges 62 of webs 52 so that when a leg element 56 is interlocked with a lug element 58 of another panel member , e . g ., member 48a , slots 64 are formed between the adjacent panel members . these slots may be , in a final display unit 2 , vertical slots 6 , horizontal slots 10 or diagonal slots 14 . with the inside panel members 40a , the webs 50 are equal in width to the webs 52 and the web 54 connects to web 52 back away from the longitudinal edge 62 &# 39 ;. with the inside panel members 40b , the web 50 is wider than the web 52a in order to save construction material as aforesaid . with the end panel members 47 , the webs 50b are wider than the webs 52b and the third web 54a connects to webs 50b and 52b along their longitudinal sides 60 &# 39 ; a and 62a respectively . the longitudinal sides 60a and 62 &# 39 ; a of webs 50b and 52b respectively are c - shaped . the member has a leg element 56 , does not include a lug element , but does have a channel element 65 integral with web 54a . the end panel members 46a & amp ; 46b include a lug element 58 , but no leg element . also the first web 50b is narrower than the second web 52 . a fourth web 70 extends laterally from the longitudinal edge 60 &# 39 ; a of web 50b and joins the longitudinal edge 72 of the l - shaped member 74 . a channel 65 is formed integral with the web 70 . in the corner panel members 48a and 48b , the first web comprises a first flat portion 50c and a second flat portion 50d normal to portion 50c . the third web 54 extends from the portion 50c and the leg element 56 extends from portion 50d . the second web 52b is fixed apart and parallel to the portion 50c by the web 54 . there is also a y - shaped element 66 that extends from the first web at the joint of the first flat portion 50c with the second flat portion 50d at an angle of approximately 45 ° relative to both flat portions . the free ends 68 of y - element 66 are preferrably c - shaped , as are the longitudinal edges 60 and 60 &# 39 ; of the first web flat portions 50d and 50c respectively . to assemble a wall - mounted display unit such as unit 44 , an s -

shaped end cap 92 . holes 94 are preformed in the leg 90 to correspond to the spacing of holes h and the transverse edges 96 of the leg 90 are cut back the width of the webs 54a and 70 ( see fig1 ). as a result , the end cap 92 can be inserted in the direction of the arrow in fig4 into the end of the unit 44a to provide a closed or finished appearance . the cap 92 can be held in place by self -

the use of biologic fluid samples in assessing tobacco smoke consumption &# 34 ;, in measurement in the analysis and treatment of smoking behavior , j . grabowski et al ., eds ., nida research monograph no . 48 , uphs , adamha ( 1983 ). in contrast to nicotine , cotinine has a relatively long terminal elimination half - life ( two versus sixteen hours , respectively ). due to this pharmacological characteristic , cotinine has become the principally used objective biochemical marker of nicotine exposure in cigarette smoking and / or cessation - related research paradigms . while cotinine is a well - known metabolite of nicotine and is routinely measured in many laboratories , no systematic investigation of the physiological and subjective effects produced by intravenous cotinine administration has been performed in humans . k . i . yamamoto et al ., international j . neuropharmacol ., 4 , 359 ( 1965 ), reported that intravenous cotinine produced increases in eeg activity and behavioral arousal in cats with only a slight decrease in blood pressure . in squirrel monkeys , intramuscular cotinine injections increased rates of responding on fixed interval schedules of reinforcement over a wide range of doses ( m . e . risner et al ., j . pharmacol . exp . ther ., 234 , 113 ( 1985 ); s . r . goldberg et al ., psychopharmacology , 97 , 295 ( 1989 )). these findings , taken together , suggest that cotinine acts as a psychomotor stimulant . however , the pharmacologic mechanism of action has yet to be determined . in two recent human studies , the pharmacokinetic profiles of intravenous - and orally administered cotinine were examined without emphasis on measuring the subjective and / or physiological changes induced by this compound ( n . l . benowitz et al ., clin . pharmacol . ther ., 34 , 604 ( 1983 ); p . j . deschepper et al ., eur . j . pharmacol ., 31 , 583 ( 1987 )). moreover , using an uncontrolled experimental design , benowitz et al ., clin . pharmacol . ther ., 34 , 604 ( 1988 ), found that intravenous cotinine produced no cardiovascular changes and only slight differences in various subjective ratings which were comparable to placebo - induced changes found in other experiments with nicotine . consequently , benowitz and his colleagues concluded that cotinine lacked significant pharmacologic activity in humans . while the most extensively studied metabolite of nicotine is cotinine , other work has examined the behavioral effects of other nicotine metabolites . in squirrel monkeys and beagle dogs , intramuscular nornicotine injections increased rates of responding on fixed interval schedules of reinforcement and was discriminated as nicotine using a discrimination procedure ( m . e . risner et al ., j . pharmacol . exp . ther ., 234 , 113 ( 1985 ); s . r . goldberg et al ., psychopharmacology , 97 , 295 ( 1989 )). these findings suggest that nornicotine is psychoactive . in another studying pharmacokinetics , g . scherer et al ., klin wochenschr , 66 , 5 ( 1988 ), intravenously administered (-)- 3 - hydroxycotinine to male cigarette smokers and determined its half - life to be approximately six hours . no mention was made of toxic side effects or specific activity from the drug . while it is possible that , for use in therapy , nicotine metabolites and / or their salts thereof may be administered as the pure chemicals , as by inhalation of a fine powder via an insufflator , it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation . the invention thus further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising of a nicotine metabolite or combination of nicotine metabolites or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof , together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor and , optionally , other therapeutic and / or prophylactic ingredients . the carrier ( s ) must be acceptable , in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof . pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral or parenteral ( including intramuscular , subcutaneous and intravenous ) administration . forms suitable for parenteral administration also include forms suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation or for nasal , or topical ( including buccal , rectal , vaginal and sublingual ) administration . the formulations may , where appropriate , be conveniently presented in discrete unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy . such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers , solid matrices , semi - solid carriers , finely divided solid carriers or combinations thereof , and then , if necessary , shaping the product into the desired delivery system . pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete unit dosage forms such as hard or soft gelatin capsules , cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient ;

for example , containing 5 to 1000 mg , conveniently 10 to 750 mg , most conveniently , 50 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form . ideally , the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0 . 5 to about 75 pm , preferably , about 1 to 50 pm , most preferably , about 2 to about 30 pm . this may be achieved , for example , by the intravenous injection of a 0 . 05 to 5 % solution of the active ingredient , optionally in saline , or orally administered as a bolus containing about 1 - 100 mg of the active ingredient . desirable blood levels may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0 . 01 - 5 . 0 mg / kg / hr or by intermittent infusions containing about 0 . 4 - 15 mg / kg of the active ingredient ( s ). the desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals , for example , as two , three , four or more sub - doses per day . the sub - dose itself may be further divided , e . g ., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations ; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye . the invention will be further described by reference to the following detailed example . participants included 18 healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 years old who had 1 ) no history of psychiatric , alcohol and drug abuse disorders , 2 ) smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day for one year prior to study admission , 3 ) an expired - air carbon monoxide concentration of greater than 20 ppm , 4 ) not currently on any medication , and 5 ) not donated blood in the past 90 days . potential subjects were carefully screened for physical and mental health problems . (-)- cotinine base was synthesized from (-)- nicotine using the bromine - zinc oxidation method described by e . r . bowman et al ., biochem . preparations . 10 , 36 ( 1963 ). hereinafter , the term &# 34 ; cotinine &# 34 ; will be used to refer to (-)- cotinine . the cotinine base was analyzed for impurities using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatography and found to be pure . using sterile techniques , cotinine solution was prepared for intravenous administration . cotinine base was combined with sterile normal saline solution to achieve a concentration of three mg of cotinine base per one ml of solution . this solution was autoclaved and found to be non - pyrogenic using a standard pyrogenicity testing . the cotinine solution was again tested for molecular structure integrity and concentration accuracy . next , 10 ml of cotinine solution ( 30 mg cotinine ) were placed into 20 ml injection vials , sealed and stored in a refrigerator until used . the placebo was ten ml of sterile normal saline solution . placebo and active drug vials were prepared and labeled in a double - blind manner by pharmacy personnel . in addition to pharmacy personnel , one study physician who had no contact with subjects during the experimental sessions had access to the drug code in the event of a medical emergency . during sessions , subjects received 10 ml ( 30 mg ) of cotinine base solution diluted to 15 ml with sterile normal saline solution or placebo ( 15 ml of sterile saline solution ) infused intravenously through a 20 gauge indwelling intravenous catheter . this infusion rate was chosen so as not to exceed two mg per minute of cotinine delivered to the subject . infusions were performed using a controlled - rate syringe infusion pump . all subjects received cotinine and placebo infusions using a randomly assigned double - blind counterbalanced - order design . the physiological parameters monitored included heart rate , systolic , diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure , and a 12 - lead electrocardiogram ( ecg ) with measurement of pr , qrs and qt intervals . the biochemical parameters included expired - air carbon monoxide level ( co ), serum nicotine and cotinine concentrations . carbon monoxide was measured using standard techniques . the serum nicotine and cotinine concentration assays were performed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry at the laboratory of physiological hygiene at the university of minnesota medical school . self - reported ratings of subjective state , mood and cigarette withdrawal symptoms were obtained from the subjects . these measures included the profile of mood states questionnaire ( poms ), several 100 mm visual analog scales ( vas ) and the cigarette withdrawal symptoms checklist ( wsc ) of symptoms related to the cigarette withdrawal syndrome ( j . r . hughes et al ., arch . gen . psychiatry , 43 , 289 , ( 1986 )). the record of withdrawal symptom is a o =( none ) to 5 =( severe ) scale of 12 symptoms associated with tws : craving for nicotine , irritable / angry , anxious / tense , difficulty concentrating , restless , impatient , excessive hunger , insomnia , increased eating , drowsiness , headaches and miscellaneous group including tremor , heart racing , sweating , dizzy or g . i . problems . two 100 mm vas forms were used . one with 11 adjectives including &# 34 ; pleasant &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; need for cigarettes &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; energy &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; hungry &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; down &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; sedated &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; anxious &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; stimulated &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; fatigue &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; craving for cigarettes &# 34 ; and a separate vas for &# 34 ; craving for tobacco &# 34 ; rated form none to extremely . from the vas forms , a measure of &# 34 ; vigor &# 34 ; was created by subtracting the sedation score from the stimulation score . also , an adverse effects questionnaire ( aeq ) was used to assess possible problems associated with cotinine administration . these problems were restlessness , headaches , tachycardia / palpatations , tremor , excessive sweating , nausea / vomiting , upset stomach , lightheadedness / dizzy , drowsy , irritable , and excessive salivation . the symptoms assessed were those known to be experienced following nicotine administration . this study was performed on an outpatient basis over nine days . subjects were required to attend five scheduled laboratory sessions . all sessions were held at the tobacco research laboratory associated with the university of minnesota hospital complex . the first session was used for obtaining informed consent , physical and psychological screening of the prospective participants , background and baseline data collection . also , the subject habituated to the data collection procedures utilized during the sessions . if the participant met inclusion criteria , he was scheduled for his next visit . prior to session 2 , the subject was randomly - assigned to one of the two cotinine administration order conditions . sessions 2 and 4 were used to collect data for all dependent variables under conditions of ad libitum cigarette smoking and serving as a baseline from which to assess tobacco withdrawal induced changes measured at the beginning of sessions 3 and 5 , respectively . all sessions were scheduled to begin between 5 and 7 pm . sessions 2 and 4 were held seven days apart and lasted approximately 15 minutes . during these sessions , vital signs , co , wsc , vas , poms and aeq were completed . blood was drawn for later measurement of serum nicotine and cotinine concentration . at the end of sessions . 2 and 4 and after departing the laboratory , subjects were required to refrain from cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco use over the next 48 hours . at the end of this 48 hour period following sessions 2 and 4 , subjects reported to the laboratory for the two drug infusion sessions 3 and 5 , respectively . during sessions 3 and 5 , subjects received cotinine and placebo infusions in a counterbalanced order during these sessions . sessions 3 and 5 were held 48 hours after sessions 2 and 4 during which time the subject was to remain tobacco abstinent . abstinence was determined by using biochemical markers of smoke exposure including co and serum cotinine concentrations . after the subject reported to the laboratory , baseline measurements of co , vital signs , wsc , vas , poms and aeq were made . next , the ecg electrodes were attached to the chest wall and limbs . a 20 gauge indwelling intravenous catheter was placed in a prominent vein in the non - dominant forearm in order to allow the subject to freely complete subjective effects questionnaires during the remainder of the session . the catheter was used for intravenous drug administration and access in the event of an adverse medical event . heart rate and blood pressure were recorded . using standard venipuncture techniques , five mls of blood was drawn from the antecubital area of the dominant arm for later serum nicotine and cotinine concentration analyses . at intervals of 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes after the drug infusion , heart rate , blood pressure , ecg , wsc , vas , aeq were completed , and blood was drawn for later serum nicotine and cotinine concentration analyses . also , the poms was completed at 30 , 60 and 120 minutes after drug administration . the blood samples were allowed to stand for 30 minutes , centrifuged for 10 minutes and the serum was pipetted into plastic cryovials for storage in a - 20 degree c . freezer until the nicotine / cotinine assays were performed . all questionnaires were scored and entered into a computer by a research assistant who was blind to the dosing conditions . at the end of the experimental period and after all data scoring , collation and entry were completed , the drug order code and serum cotinine concentrations were entered into the computer . of the eighteen subjects who began the study , fourteen subjects were considered to be tobacco abstinent using the biochemical markers of cigarette smoke exposure during the two abstinence periods . as a result , only the data from these fourteen individuals were included in the statistical analyses . the statistical analyses included a two within subjects factor repeated measures analysis of variance ( dose × time ) using spss for the microcomputer . due to large expectancy effects which occurred at the end of the session , the two hour time point for all variables not included in the analyses . statistical significance was defined as a p - value equal to or less than a five percent probability of a chance occurrence . eighteen male cigarette smokers who were required to be abstinent prior to receiving the drug infusions in sessions 3 and 5 participated . upon receipt of the serum cotinine concentration data , four subjects were found not to be abstinent from cigarette smoking during the abstinence phases . their data was excluded from subsequent statistical analyses . of the four data sets removed , two received drug first and two received placebo first maintaining the counterbalanced - order design . the data presented herein represent those collected from the 14 study - compliant completing participants . the participants were healthy male cigarette smokers whose average age was 25 . 6 years ( sd = 6 . 5 ). none of the participants were interested in cigarette smoking cessation . they smoked an average of 25 . 4 ( sd = 6 . 0 ) cigarettes per day . their average expired - air carbon monoxide concentration was 9 . 1 ( sd = 7 . 3 ). their average expressed - air carbon monoxide concentration was 28 . 1 ppm ( sd = 10 . 3 ). the average ftc estimated nicotine yield of their cigarettes was 0 . 87 ( sd = 0 . 3 ). their average baseline serum cotinine concentration was 378 ( sd = 16 . 3 ). their mean education level was 14 . 5 years ( sd = 1 . 7 ). table 1__________________________________________________________________________biochemical measures cotinine placebo differencevariable mean ( se ) mean ( se ) mean ( se ) t -

active and produces many subjective changes in humans without affecting cardiovascular activity . further , while cotinine administration appeared to exacerbate certain symptoms of the tobacco withdrawal syndrome including restlessness and anxiety / tension , it simultaneously attenuated other withdrawal symptoms including sedation and the various craving measures ( for tobacco , nicotine and cigarettes ) experienced during the session . also , the subjective profile of cotinine base following intravenous administration is consistent with the activity of a psychomotor stimulant . other findings reported herein suggest that a nicotine metabolite , cotinine , may serve to act as an appetite suppressant and could be responsible in part for the decreased body weight of tobacco users . the data suggest that cotinine is a psychomotor stimulant and its ability to suppress appetite probably stems from this activity . acutely , people using psychomotor stimulants typically report more anxiety , tension , insomnia , irritability , restlessness and less sedated until they become tolerant to these effects . also , psychomotor stimulants typically are used as appetite suppressants ( e . g ., phentermine , phenmetrazine , amphetamine , fenfluramine , diethylproprion ). nicotine has been shown to increase resting metabolism and decrease perceived taste intensity of various foods in nicotine - experienced and nicotine - naive individuals suggesting a mechanism by which this drug exerts its effects . if nicotine and its metabolites act through the same mechanism , then they should act similarly in nicotine - experienced , nicotine - abstinent or nicotine - naive individuals . all publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are indicative of the level of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains . all publications and patent applications are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference . it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made in the invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims .",8
"fig1 shows the retina 1 , the iris 2 and the lens 3 of a human eye . the lens 3 has a clouded portion 4 which is or can be attributable to the age of the patient or to a disease ( cataract ). the clouded portion 4 is assumed to be of such nature that it adversely affects the effectiveness of the eye even if the retina 1 is intact . the apparatus for measuring the extent of clouding or obscuring of the lens 3 comprises a radiation source 5 which emits a beam of radiation along a first path 6 extending through the diaphragm of the iris 2 and impinging upon the clouded portion 4 . the latter disperses and reflects the incident beam of radiation and some of the dispersed and reflected radiation propagates itself along a second path 7 which is inclined with reference to the first path 6 . the extent to which the clouded portion 4 disperses the beam which impinges upon it after having advanced along the path 6 is proportional to the cloudiness of the lens 3 , i . e ., the diffusion of incident radiation is more pronounced if the clouded portion 4 is more pronounced . the improved apparatus further comprises means for monitoring the reflected radiation , and such monitoring means includes a photoelectronic transducer 8 which is installed in the second path 7 and generates signals denoting at least one characteristic of the reflected light , namely a characteristic which is indicative of the degree of dispersion of incident radiation by the clouded portion 4 . the signals which are transmitted by the transducer 8 form a photocurrent which is supplied to a simple signal processing device in the form of a nanoamperemeter 9 with a pointer and a suitably calibrated scale to indicate the seriousness of the clouding of the lens 3 in appropriate units . the apparatus of fig1 further comprises ( or can further comprise ) a host of additional components including mirrors which direct radiation along selected paths , filters and / or other optical elements . some of these optical elements are shown in fig2 . the radiation source 5 is or can be selected in such a way that it emits monochromatic light . fig1 further shows a modulator 10 which can influence the beam of radiation in the path 6 , e . g ., to modulate the intensity of radiation which is being emitted by the source 5 toward the iris 2 . for example , the radiation source 5 can emit a bundle of light which is used as an orientation beam and the modulator 10 can periodically increase the intensity of emitted light in pulsating fashion . the source 5 can emit radiation in the infrared or in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum or in the visible light range . the angle alpha between the paths 6 and 7 is preferably less than 91 °, more preferably between 5 and 90 ° and most preferably between 10 and 40 °. the radiation source 5 can constitute the light source of a slit lamp which includes means ( such as binoculars ) for permitting observation of the clouded portion 4 along the second path 7 . to this end , the slit lamp includes an ocular 107 whose axis coincides with the path 7 . a portion of radiation which is reflected by the clouded portion 4 of the lens 3 into and propagates itself along the path 7 can be deflected between the observation objective and one of the two oculars of the slit lamp by a partially transmitting mirror to impinge upon the photoelectronic transducer 8 . it is equally within the purview of the invention to replace one ocular of the slit lamp with a light measuring head which includes the transducer 8 . it is presently preferred to employ a transducer 8 wherein the spectral sensitivity distribution is the same as that of the human eye and to place the transducer behind a suitable filter . this ensures that the quantification of cloudiness of the lens corresponds to the subjective sensation of the patient . the photoelectronic transducer 8 can be replaced with a video camera whose images are electronically stored in a suitable memory . the camera can be used in conjunction with a computer which processes the signals from the camera and displays them in the form of curves , or which integrates or otherwise averages the signals and transmits a single averaged signal . the nanoamperemeter 9 of fig1 can be replaced with a more sophisticated ( e . g ., electronically controlled ) signal receiving and processing device of any known design . fig2 shows a modified apparatus wherein all such parts which are identical with or clearly analogous to corresponding parts of the apparatus of fig1 are denoted by similar reference characters . the radiation source 5 comprises a light emitting diode which is designed to emit light in the dark red range ( approximately 690 nm ). the light beam transfer from the source 5 through an adjustable diaphragm 11 and is deflected by a mirror 12 to impinge upon a partially light transmitting prismatic beam splitter 17 . the thus deflected beam of radiation passes through the main objective 14 of an optical system 13 whose axis coincides with the first path portion extending to the clouded portion 4 of the lens 3 behind the iris 2 of the eye of the patient . the diaphragm 11 can be set to permit the passage of a beam having a diameter of 1 . 3 - 3 mm . if desired , the aperture of the diaphragm 11 can have a noncircular outline in order to reduce the likelihood of excessive reflection of the beam of incident radiation by the cornea of the eye of the patient . the main objective 14 serves to image the iris 2 in the ocular 15 of the optical system 13 ( e . g ., a suitable telescope ), and to image the beam of red light which is directed toward the iris 2 along the path 6 . the beam splitter 17 of the optical system 13 mixes the radiation in the respective portion of the path 6 . an abbe prism 18 of the optical system 13 is disposed between the beam splitter 17 and the ocular 15 to reverse the image . a fixation point 19 is provided in the first path to enable the patient to look in the direction toward the beam splitter 17 . the clouded portion 4 can constitute a cataract which disperses and reflects some of the incident radiation into the path 7 wherein the reflected radiation impinges upon the photoreceiver 20 of a transducer 8 . the receiver 20 can include an optical element and a preamplifier which directs signals to a second component 21 of the transducer 8 , preferably a combined amplifier and band pass filter whose output is connected with a demodulator 22 having an output connected with the corresponding input of a microprocessor 23 . the band pass filter of the component 21 eliminates or reduces the influence of undesirable factors , and the amplifier of the component 21 intensifies the signals to a level which is required for convenient processing in the microcomputer 23 . the demodulator 22 serves to relieve the signals of noise and to demodulate the signals so that they are devoid of radiation which is attributable to daylight or artificial light , i . e ., the signals which reach the microcomputer 23 are derived solely from radiation which is emitted by the source 5 . an analog - digital converter ( not specifically shown ) is installed between the demodulator 22 and the microprocessor 23 which latter is equipped with a keyboard 24 . the microprocessor 23 of the transducer 8 processes the digital signals in accordance with selected mathematical algorithms before the signals reach an alphanumerical display unit 25 . if desired , the output of the microcomputer 23 can be connected with the input of a printer 26 which can be used with or in lieu of the display unit 25 . the components 25 , 26 together constitute a functional equivalent of the amperemeter 9 of fig1 . an output of the microcomputer 23 is connected with the modulator 10 for the beam of radiation issuing from the source 5 . the apparatus of the present invention can be designed to measure the polarization of light which is attributable to the presence of a cataract 4 . such polarization measurement ( in the path 7 ) can take place in addition to or in lieu of a measurement of intensity of reflected radiation . this is often desirable and advantageous if the source 5 emits nonpolarized light . the monitoring means ( transducer 8 ) can further comprise means for monitoring the electric or magnetic field of radiation in the path 7 to ascertain the energy density which is directly proportional to the rate of dispersion of radiation by the cataract 4 . if the source 5 emits monochromatic light , the monitoring means can operate in accordance with fresnel interference principles to ascertain the extent to which the dispersion of light affects the monochromaticity of light ( nonelastic dispersion ) which is an indication of the rate of dispersion of light by the cataract 4 . slit lamps which can be used in the apparatus of the present invention are manufactured and sold by haag - streit ag , hess - str . 27 , ch - 3097 liebefeld , switzerland . without further analysis , the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can , by applying current knowledge , readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that , from the standpoint of prior art , fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic and specific aspects of my contribution to the art and , therefore , such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the appended claims

"referring more particularly to fig1 there is shown a generalized block diagram illustrating a computer - supported display system in accordance with the present invention . the system of fig1 includes a local terminal computer memory 25 and a remote host computer memory 24 , interconnected by a data link 23 . interacting computer programs ( software ) reside in both the host computer 24 and the terminal 25 . the communications controller program 13 and the host controller program 12 manage the communications data link 23 . terminal controller 11 and host controller 12 each also manage multiple processes 10 and 21 , respectively , in its own environment , and multiplex their communications into a single stream for transmission on the data link 23 . the controller program 12 or 13 on the other end does the demultiplexing , as well as routing messages to the proper destination . such divided control of graphical displays is disclosed in christensen et al u . s . pat . no . 3 , 534 , 338 granted oct . 13 , 1970 . the terminal controller 11 exercises supervisory control over multiple processes , including the keyboard controller 16 , the mouse controller 14 ,, the communications controller 13 and the layer controller 19 . the keyboard controller 16 collects ascii coded signals representing keyboard characters and forwards them through controller 19 to the proper program 10 . mouse 15 is a well - known graphical input device which controls the position of a cursor on the screen and provides a plurality of control keys for modifying the display . such devices are well known and are described in the above - identified issue of byte publications , inc . the mouse controller program 14 assigns the mouse 15 to one of the displayed layer programs 10 . the communications controller 13 manages communications through the data link 23 with the host computer 24 for each layer program 10 . the layer controller program 19 is responsible for keeping the contents and visibility of each layer correct and current in response to the execution of layer programs 10 and 21 . each layer is kept up to date , regardless of whether it is currently visible , overlapped or totally obscured . terminal controller 11 , in combination with mouse 15 and mouse controller 14 , provides the user with the ability to create a layer of any size at any position on the cathode ray tube ( crt ) 18 , by pointing with the cursor under the control of mouse 15 . the mouse 15 is a peripheral device which makes possible interactions that are not as convenient with just a keyboard 17 alone . pushing a button on the mouse 15 , for example , can control the display of a self - explanatory menu of commands . users can switch their attention to any layer on the screen 18 or bring it to the top of the display by pointing the mouse 15 at an unobstructed portion of the layer and pushing a button . when a layer is created , a copy of a terminal simulating program 10 is associated with it in the terminal local memory 25 , and a separate executing command interpreter program 21 is associated with it on the host computer 24 . thus , each user &# 34 ; program &# 34 ; is implemented as two cooperating programs , one that runs in the terminal 25 and one that runs on host computer 24 , exchanging information via the data link 12 . the actual rectangular images of all of the layers on the screen 18 are recorded in bitmap memory 22 . storage medium 22 is a block of storage which lends itself to storing rectangular bitmaps which can be used to create images on the screen 18 . fig2 is a front view of a terminal 30 with a screen 31 depicting three overlapping layers a , b and c as they would actually appear on a cathode ray tube ( crt ) screen 31 . a &# 34 ; layer &# 34 ; in this sense , is a rectangular portion of the screen 31 and its associated image . it may be thought of as a virtual display screen since it comprises a graphical or visual environment in which a user can do any thing that could be done on an entire screen . layers may overlap as shown in fig2 but a set of bitmaps capable of maintaining an image of the obscured portion of a layer is always kept current . because all processes are asynchronous , drawing actions can be directed at any time to an obscured layer , and a resulting graphical object such as a line will be partially visible on the screen and partially recorded in the bitmaps representing the obscured portions of the layer . bitmap layer a in fig2 is the only unobscured layer . layer b is partially obscured by layer a while layer c is partially obscured by both layer a and layer b . while an operator can interact with these layers only one - at - a - time , the programs 21 ( fig1 ) continually update the bitmaps corresponding to these layers , in both the visible and obscured portions . referring more particularly to fig3 there is shown an example of overlayed layers in a terminal such as that shown in fig2 . reference numeral 40 indicates the top layer , layer a , while reference numeral 41 indicates a bottom partially obscured layer b . it can be seen that the rectangular area 42 which constitutes part of bitmap 41 is obscured in the display by the overlapping portion of laye a , shown as bitmap 40 . since the obscured portion 42 will not be displayed on the screen , it is necessary to provide a bitmap storage for the obscured rectangle . partial bitmap 44 serves this purpose . bitmap 41 is linked to bitmap 44 by a pointer 43 illustrated in the drawing as a directed arrow . the entire bitmap for layer b includes the unobscured portion of layer b in bitmap 41 , plus the obscured portion 44 , stored in a nondisplayed portion of the terminal memory . to programs operating on the bitmaps , the displayed and obscured portions are linked together in such a fashion that bitmap operators can operate on the entire bitmap whether or not displayed . to this end , the computer software maintains an obscured bitmap list comprising nothin more than a sequence of pointers to the obscured bitmap areas . this list is used to construct a bitmap of the entire area for purposes of recording in the bitmap the results of programs executing in the corresponding layer . this can be better seen in the schematic diagram of fig4 . referring then to fig4 there is shown a schematic diagram of the bitmap storage areas necessary to represent the layers illustrated in fig2 . thus , reference numeral 71 represents a bitmap of the entire display area which includes three layers , 56 , 57 and 58 , identified as layers a , b and c , respectively . as can be seen in fig4 bitmap 56 overlays and thus obscures portions of both bitmap 57 and bitmap 58 . moreover , bitmap 57 also overlays portions of bitmap 58 . since these various obscured portions will not be visible on the screen display , storage for the obscured portions of the bitmap must be maintained so that these portions can be updated concurrently with the execution of the corresponding programs . it can thus be seen that partial bitmap 59 in storage area 72 is used to store the bitmap of the area 51 of layer c obscured by layer b . similarly , the partial bitmap 60 is used to store the bitmap of layer c obscured by layer b . it will be noted that all obscured portions of the various layers are divided into rectangular areas in order to ease processing . the obscured area 54 represents an area of layer b obscured by layer a and also represents a portion of layer c obscured by layer b . thus , the area 54 requires two partial bitmaps , bitmap 61 and bitmap 64 , to represent the obscured portions of layers c and b , respectively . the bitmap portions are connected to the associated layers and to each other by directed arrows 65 , 66 , 67 and 68 for layer c and 69 and 70 for layer b . these directed arrows represent graphically the obscured list for each layer . these pointers are used during processing to update the bitmaps associated with each layer . the fact that a layer bitmap is actually composed of several disassociated parts , is a fact that is transparent to the graphical primitives . these areas are reassembled logically to permit direct bitmap operations on a virtual bitmap of the entire layer . only unobscured portions , of course , are actually displayed on the terminal screen . it will be noted that the obscured area 53 , 54 is divided into two pieces , 53 and 54 , depending on what layers have obscured these areas . although this area could be created as a single entity , for purposes of updating layer b , it is convenient to provide the breakdown shown in fig4 . if the layers are rearranged , the algorithms for dealing with the single and double obscured areas are greatly simplified . for this reason , these subdivisions are made when the layer is first created , and the positions and dimensions of the layer are made available to the software . in appendix a , there is shown a data structure declaration using the conventions of the c language , as described in the c programming language by b . w . kernighan and d . m . ritchie , prentice - hall , 1978 , for the bitmap arrays . the individual layers are chained together in the memory as a double - linked list in order , from the &# 34 ; front &# 34 ; to the &# 34 ; back &# 34 ; of the screen . of course , if they do not overlap , the order is irrelevant . in addition to the linked layers , each layer structure contains a pointer to a list of obscured rectangles and to the bounding rectangle on the screen . the obscured lists are also doubly - linked , but in no particular order . each element in the obscured list points to the bitmap for storing the off - screen image and contains a pointer to the next - adjacent layer toward the front which obscures it . returning to fig1 the various elements depicted are generally well - known in the prior art . the hardware elements , such as mouse 15 , keyboard 17 , and screen 18 , are identical to such elements in the prior art and , indeed , may be purchased as off - the - shelf items for the present application . furthermore , the majority of the software elements depicted in fig1 are also well known in the prior art . the mouse controller 14 and the keyboard controller 16 , for example , are likewise software processes which are well known and available in the prior art . the communication controller 13 and the contents of the remote memory 24 are similarly known and can be found in the aforementioned christensen et al . patent . moreover , the bitmap manipulation procedures known to the prior art can be used in the present invention because the layer processing software , to be described hereafter , is designed to make the various layers appear to the bitmap operators as virtual terminals upon which the bitmap operators can interact directly . the balance of the present disclosure will be used to describe the software elements in local memory 23 which are necessary to create the various layers and the bitmaps representing those layers in response to input from elements 15 , 17 , and 18 , as well as program output from the remote host computer memory 24 via data link 23 . the programs described herein are written in a pseudo - c dialect and use several simple defined types and primitive bitmap operations . ______________________________________ a point is defined as an ordered pair typedef struct { int x , y ; } point ; ______________________________________ that defines a location in a bitmap such as the screen . the coordinate axes are oriented with x positive to the right and y positive down , with ( 0 , 0 ) in the upper left corner of the screen . a rectangle is defined by a pair of points at the upper left and lower right , i . e ., ______________________________________typedef struct { point origin ; /* upper left */ point corner ; /* lower right */} rectangle ; ______________________________________ rectangles are half - open ; i . e ., a rectangle contains the horizontal and vertical lines through the origin , and abuts , but does not contain , the lines through &# 34 ; corner &# 34 ;. two abutting rectangles r 0 and r 1 , with therefore have no point in common . the same applies to lines in any direction ; a line segment drawn from ( x 0 , y 0 ) to ( x 1 , y 1 ) does not contain ( x 1 , y 1 ). these definitions simplify drawing objects in pieces , which is convenient for the present implementation . the subroutine rectf ( b , r , f ) performs the function specified by an integer code f , in a rectangle r , in a bitmap b . the function code f is one of : ______________________________________f -- clr : clear rectangle to zerosf -- or : set rectangle to onesf -- xor : invert bits in rectangle______________________________________ the routine bitblt ( sb , r , db , p , f ) ( bit - block transfer ) copies a source rectangle r in a bitmap sb to a corresponding rectangle with origin p in a destination bitmap db . the routine bitblt is therefore a form of rectangle assignment operator , and the function code f specifies the nature of the assignment : ______________________________________f -- store : dest = sourcef -- or : dest | = sourcef -- clr : dest & amp ; = ˜ sourcef -- xor : dest = source______________________________________ for example , f -- or specifies that the destination rectangle is formed from the bit - wise or of the source and destination rectangles before the bitblt () procedure . the routine bitblt () is a fundamental bitmap operation . it is used to draw characters , save screen rectangles and present menus . defined more generally , it includes rectf (). in the general case , the data from the source rectangle must be shifted or rotated and masked before being written to the destination rectangle . a rectangle may consist of several tens of kilobytes of memory , so it is possible that a single bitblt () may consume a substantial amount of processor time . a bitmap is a dot - matrix representation of a rectangular image . the details of the representation depend on the display hardware , or , more specifically , on the arrangement of memory in the display . for the idea of a bitmap to mesh well with software in the display , the screen must appear to the program as a bitmap with no special properties other than its visibility . because images ( bitmaps ) are stored off - screen , off - screen memory should have the same format as the screen itself , so that copying images to and from the screen is not a special case in the software . the simplest way to achieve this generality is to make the screen a contiguous array of memory , with the last word in a scan line followed immediately by the first word of the next scan line . under this scheme , bitmaps become simple two - dimensional arrays . given a two - dimensional array in which to store the actual image , some auxiliary information is required for its interpretation . fig5 illustrates how a bitmap is interpreted . the hatched region 80 is the location of the image . when a bitmap is allocated , the allocation routine , balloc (), assumes its data will correspond to a screen rectangle , for example , a part of one layer obscured by another . the balloc () routine creates the left and right margins of the bitmap to word - align the bitmap with the screen , so word boundaries 81 in the bitmap are at the same relative positions as in the screen . in fig5 the unused margin to the left of the image area in the bitmap is storage wasted to force the word - alignment . if the first bit of the image were always stored at the high bit of first word , there would only be wasted storage at the right edge of the bitmap , but copying the bitmap to the screen would require each full word in the bitmap to be rotated or shifted and masked . some bitmaps , such as icons , may be copied to an arbitrary screen location , so the word - alignment does not assist them . other than the extra space , however , no penalty is paid for the bitmap structure &# 39 ; s generality , because such images must usually be shifted when copied to the screen , and the choice of origin bit position is , on the average , irrelevant . the balloc () routine takes one argument , the on - screen rectangle which corresponds to the bitmap image , and returns a pointer to a data structure of type bitmap . bitmap is defined thus : ______________________________________typedef struct { word * base ; /* start of data */ unsigned width ; /* width in words */ rectangle rect ; /* image rectangle */} bitmap ; ______________________________________ the elements of the structure are illustrated in fig5 . width is in words , which are a fixed number ( e . g ., 16 ) of bits long . the parameter rect is the argument to balloc (), and defines the coordinate system inside the bitmap . the storage in the bitmap outside rect ( the unhatched portion 81 in fig5 ) is unused , as described above . typically , width is the number of words across the bitmap , between the arrows in fig5 . a bitmap may be contained in another bitmap , however , if width is the width of the outer bitmap , and &# 34 ; base &# 34 ; points to the first word in the bitmap . although such bitmaps are not created by balloc (), they have utility in representing the portion of the screen occupied by a layer . the balloc () routine and its obvious counterpart bfree () hide all issues of storage management for bitmaps . the bitmap structure is used throughout the illustrative embodiment of the present invention . graphics primitives operate on points , lines and rectangles within bitmaps , not necessarily on the screen . the screen itself is simply a globally accessible bitmap structure , called &# 34 ; display ,&# 34 ; and is unknown within the graphics primitives . a layer is a rectangular portion of the screen and its associated image . it may be thought of as a virtual display screen . layers may overlap ( although they need not ), but the image in the obscured portion of a layer is always kept current . typically , an asynchronous process , such as a terminal program or circuit design system , draws pictures and text in a layer , just as it might draw on a full screen if it were the only process on the display . because processes are asynchronous , drawing actions can take place at any time in an obscured layer , and a graphical object such as a line may be partially visible on the screen and partially in the obscured portion of the layer . the layer software isolates a program , drawing in an isolated region on the screen , from other such programs in other regions , and guarantees that the image on - and off - screen is always correct , regardless of the configuration of the layers on the screen . layers are different from the common notion of windows . windows are used to save a programming or working environment , such as a text editing session , to process &# 34 ; interrupts &# 34 ; such as looking at a file or sending mail , or to keep several static contexts , such as file contents , on the screen . layers are intended to maintain an environment , even though it may change because the associated programs are still running . the term ∓ layer &# 34 ; was coined to avoid the more cumbersome phrase &# 34 ; asynchronous windows &# 34 ;. nontheless , the difference between layers and windows is significant . the concept of multiple active contexts is natural to use and powerful to exploit . truly asynchronous grahics operations are difficult to support , because the state of a layer may change while a graphics operation is underway . the obvious simple solution is to perform graphical operations atomically . this partially asynchronous strategy is used throughout the present embodiment of the invention . processes explicitly call the scheduler when they are at a suitable stopping point and there is no interruptive scheduling . although this technique forces an extra discipline on the programmer ( as distinct from a user ), it adds little in complexity to the programs implementing the present invention and significantly simplifies the terminal run - time environment . it also avoids many potential race conditions , protocol problems , and difficulties with nonreentrant compiled code for structure - valued functions in c . for the purely single - user environment of a display terminal , such a scheme offers most of the benefits of preemptive scheduling , but with smaller , simpler , software . the data structures for layers are illustrated in fig3 and 4 . a partially obscured layer has an obscured list : a list of rectangles in that layer obscured by another layer or layers . in fig3 layer a obscures layer b . layer b &# 39 ; s obscured list has a single entry , which is marked &# 34 ; obscured by a .&# 34 ; if more than one layer obscures a rectangle , the rectangle is marked as obscured by the frontmost ( unobscured ) layer intersecting the rectangle . this is illustrated by rectangle 54 in fig4 . rectangle 54 is an obscured part of both layers b and c , so these layers store their obscured pieces off - screen , and mark them blocked by layer a . rectangles 53 and 54 ( fig4 ) may be stored as a single rectangle , as they were in fig3 . they are stored as two because if layer c is later moved to the front of the screen ( i . e . the top of the pile of layers ), it will obscure portions of both layers a and b . rectangle 54 in layer b would be obscured by c , but rectangle 53 would still be obscured by layer a . to simplify the algorithms for rearranging layers , the layer creation routine does all necessary subdivision when the layer is first made , so when layer c is created , the obscured rectangle in b is split in two along the edge of the new layer . the first part of the layer structure is identical to that of a bitmap . actually , the bitmap structure has an extra item to it : a null obs pointer , so a bitmap may be passed to a graphics routine expecting a layer as argument . the operating system in the present invention uses this subterfuge to camouflage layers . to a user - level program , layers do not exit , only bitmaps . the one layer that the user program sees , &# 34 ; display ,&# 34 ; is only used for graphics functions , and is therefore functionally a bitmap to the user program . the individual layers are chained together as a double - linked list , in order from &# 34 ; front &# 34 ; to &# 34 ; back &# 34 ; on the screen ( when they do not overlap , the order is irrelevant ). besides the link pointers , a layer structure contains a pointer to the list of obscured rectangles and the bounding rectangle on the screen . the obscured lists are also double - linked , but in no particular order . each element in the obscured list contains a bitmap for storing the off - screen image , and a pointer to the frontmost layer which obscures it . as will be seen later , an obscured element need only record which ( unobscured ) layer is on the screen &# 34 ; in front &# 34 ; of it , not any other obscured layers which also share that portion of the screen . obscured . bmap -& gt ; rect is the screen coordinates of the obscured rectangle . all coordinates in the layer manipulations are screen coordinates . the routine layerop (), shown in appendix b , is the main interface between layers and the graphics primitives . given a layer , a rectangle within the layer , and a bitmap operator , it recursively subdivides the rectangle into rectangles contained in single bitmaps , and invokes the operator on the rectangle / bitmap pairs . to simplify the operators , layerop () also passed along , unaltered , a pointer to a set of parameters to the bitmap operator . for example , to clear a rectangle in a layer , layerop () is called with the target layer , the rectangle within the layer in screen coordinates , and a procedure ( the bitmap operator ) to invoke rectf (). the layerop () routine divides the rectangle into its components in obscured and visible portions of the layer , and calls the procedure to clear the component rectangles . routine layerop () itself does no graphical operations ; it merely controls graphical operations done by the bitmap operator handed to it . it turns a bitmap operator into a layer operator . the layerop () routine first clips the target rectangle to the layer , then calls the recursive routine rlayerop () to do the subdivision . see appendix d for the pseudo - code for rlayerop . rlayerop () recursively chains along the obscured list of the layer , performing the operation on the intersection of the argument rectangle and the obscured bitmap , and passing nonintersecting portions on to be intersected with other bitmaps on the obscured list . when the obscured list is empty , the rectangle must be drawn on the screen . the code to test if two rectangles overlap is found in appendix c . the layer pointer and obscured pointer are passed to the bitmap operator ((* fn )()) because , although they are clearly not needed for graphical operations , layerop ()&# 39 ; s subdivision is useful enough to be exploited by some of the software to maintain the layers themselves . note that if layerop () is handed a layer with a null obs pointer , or a bitmap , its effect is simply to clip the rectangle and call the bitmap operator . so far , otherargs has been referred to in a deliberately vague manner . the layerop () routine works something like printf (): after the arguments required by layerop () ( the layer , bitmap operator and rectangle ), the calling function passes the further arguments needed by the bitmap operator . the layerop () routine passes the address of the first of these arguments through to the operator , which therefore sees a pointer to a structure containing the necessary arguments . appendix e illustrates the action of layerop (). the routine lblt () uses layerop () and bitblt () to copy an offscreen bitmap to a rectangle within a layer . the bitmap may contain , for example , a character . there are three basic transformations that can in principle be applied to layers : changing the front - to - back positions of overlapping layers ( stacking ); changing the dimensions of a layer ( scaling ); and changing the position of a layer on the screen ( translation ). any stacking transformation can be defined as a sequential set of one - layer rearrangement operations , moving a single layer to another position , such as to the front or back of the stack of layers . for example , the stack can be inverted by an action similar to counting through a deck of cards . the upfront () routine is an operator that moves a layer to the front of the stack , making it completely visible . it is the only stacking operator in the layer software , because in the few instances where a different operation is required , the desired effect can be achieved , with acceptable efficiency , by successive calls to upfront (). the action of pulling a layer to the front was chosen because it is the most natural . when something interesting happens in a partially obscured layer , the instinctive reaction is to pull the layer to the front where it can be studied . the upfront () routine also turns out to be a useful operation during the creation and deletion of layers . scaling and translation operators will not be discussed . the upfront () routine has a simple structure . most of the code is concerned with maintaining the linked lists . the basic algorithm is to exchange the obscured rectangles in the layer with those of the layer obscuring them , swapping the contents of the obscured bitmap with the screen . since the obscured rectangle has the same dimensions before and after the swap , the exchange can be done in place , and it is not necessary to allocate a new bitmap ; it is only necessary to link it into the new obscured layer . obscured rectangles are marked with the frontmost obscuring layer for upfront ()&# 39 ; s benefit : the frontmost layer is the layer that occupies the portion of the screen the rectangle would occupy were it at the front . see appendix f for the pseudo - code for the operator upfront (). the screenswap () routine interchanges the data in the bitmap with the contents of the rectangle on the screen , in place . it is easily implemented , without auxiliary storage , using three calls to bitblt () with function code f -- xor . note that because of the fragmentation of the obscured portions done when a new layer is created , if lp -& gt ; rect and op -& gt ; bmap -& gt ; rect intersect , the layer must completely obscure it . note also that it is upfront () which enforces the rule that the frontmost layer obscuring a portion of a second layer is the layer marked as obscuring it . only if these two layers are interchanged is the screen updated . it is simpler to delete a layer than to create one . the algorithm is : ( 1 ) pull the layer to the front . it now has no obscured pieces , and is a contiguous rectangle on the screen . ( 3 ) push the layer to the back . all storage needed for the obscured portions of the layer is now bound to the layer , since it obscures no other layer . a special routine , the opposite of upfront (), could be written to push the layer to the back , but upfront () can be used for the task . see appendix g for the dellayer pseudo - code . successive calls to upfront () push a layer to the back . the upfront () routine does not join disconnected obscured bitmaps which could be joined because of the deletion . making a new layer may require modifying obscured lists of other layers . if the new layer creates any new overlaps , the obscured list of the overlapped layer must be restructured so that upfront () need not subdivide any rectangles to pull the obscured layer to the front . the creation routine , newlayer () is shown in appendix j . the basic structure of newlayer () is to build the layer at the back , constructing the obscured list by intersecting the layer &# 39 ; s rectangle with the obscured rectangles and visible portions of the current layers . after allocating storage for the obscured bitmaps , the layer is pulled to the front , making it contiguous on the screen and forcing the rectangles obscured by the new layer to contain the new storage required by the addition of the new layer . finally , the screen rectangle occupied by the new layer is cleared to complete the operation . several ancillary routines are used by newlayer (). the addrect () routine adds rectangles to the obscured lists , obs , of the new layer . since the new layer is built at the &# 34 ; back &# 34 ; of the screen , any obscured rectangle of the new layer will be obscured by a layer already on the screen . the addrect () routine builds the list of unique obscured rectangles , marked by which layer is currently occupying the screen in each rectangle . to be sure that a rectangle is unique , it is sufficient to check just the origin point of the rectangle . the rectangles passed to addrect () are ordered so that the first layer associated with a particular rectangle occupies the screen in that rectangle . see appendix h for the addrect () pseudo - code . the addobs () routine does recursive subdivision of the obscured rectangles that intersect the new layer , calling addrect () when an overlap is established . it is similar to layerop () except that it does not chain along the obscured list , and no special action ( i . e ., storage allocation ) is required if the rectangles match exactly . as subdivided pieces are added to the obscured list of a current layer , the original rectangle must remain in the list until all the subdivided pieces are also in the list , whereupon it is deleted . new pieces must therefore be added after the original piece . when the topmost call to addobs () returns , the subdivision ( if any ) is complete , and the return value is whether the argument rectangle was subdivided . the newlayer () routine then removes the original rectangle from the list if addobs () returns true . the pseudo - code for addobs is illustrated in appendix i . the newlayer () routine ( appendix j ) takes an argument bitmap , which is typically the screen bitmap display , but may be any other . it is a simple generalization from layers within bitmaps to layers within layers , and a true hierarchy . the addpiece () routine is a trivial routine to add to the obscured list the rectangles that are currently unobscured ( i . e ., have only one layer ) but that will be obscured by the new layer . appendix k is the pseudo - code for addpiece (). ## spc1 ##",6
"referring now to the figures of the drawing in detail and first , particularly , to fig1 thereof , there is shown an offset printing press 1 of inline design comprising a feeder 2 , wherein the unprinted paper stack 3 is located , six printing units 8 a to 8 f for the four primary colors and , if appropriate , two further special colors , a first varnishing unit 9 a , following the latter two dryer units 10 a and 10 b , a second varnishing unit 9 b and a delivery 5 with the sheet delivery stack 6 . in the region of the chain guides of the delivery 5 , four further dryer units 11 a to 11 d are arranged one after another in the sheet transport direction . a printing press of this type is offered , for example , under the designation speedmaster ® xl 105 - 6 - lyylx3 by heidelberger druckmaschinen ag . in the region designated by 50 , arrows which are directed inward or outward symbolize the points in the printing press at which moisture is put into or removed from the printing process . the arrow 4 symbolizes the moisture content which is already in the printing material sheets stacked up in the feeder 2 . at this point , moisture is understood to mean the material moisture of the paper , that is to say the quantity of water which is bound in the paper per unit quantity of the latter . a material moisture of 8 % in the feed paper stack therefore means that a paper sheet of 100 grams contains 8 grams of water . if , following its acclimatization , the paper stack is in the “ equilibrium state ” with the ambient air in the print shop , then the equilibrium moisture can be determined via the sorption isotherms of the paper with knowledge of the relative atmospheric humidity and the temperature of the air in the print shop . however , such acclimatization of the paper stack in the feeder has often not taken place at all . this is because it is entirely possible that paper stacks are brought from a store to the printing press in the short term and the material moisture of the paper then still corresponds to the climatic conditions in the storeroom . therefore , in order to determine the material moisture , it is more advantageous to use a measuring method which detects the moisture in the paper directly . known for this purpose are methods based on high - frequency , microwave or infrared absorption measurements . the printing units 8 are printing units for wet offset , that is to say they have a dampening unit via which the printing plate is dampened before being inked , some of this dampening solution reaching the sheet to be printed via the blanket cylinder in the printing unit . this input of moisture is symbolized by the arrow 18 . the arrow 13 represents the proportion of water which itself originates from the ink printed onto the sheet . of course , in the case of oil - based offset printing inks , this proportion is low . the arrow 12 takes account of the fact that , during the transport of the printed sheet through the machine , a certain amount of evaporation takes place , since the printing unit moistened with ink and dampening solution and the printed sheet are moister than the surrounding air in the printing press . however , the most important moisture streams are formed by the varnish layers applied to the printed sheet in the varnishing units 19 a and 19 b , in any case when they are not uv - curable varnishes but water - based varnishes , such as emulsion varnishes . this is symbolized by the arrows 19 a and 19 b . a further very important exchange of moisture takes place in the dryer units 10 a and 10 b and also 11 a to 11 d . these dryer units are supplied with feed air from the surroundings ( arrows 20 and 21 ) at the relative moisture of about 50 % prevailing in the print shop , which air is then heated up ( in the case of hot air dryers ) when it enters the dryer 10 a , 10 b , 11 a to 11 d , for example , in the case of ir radiation dryers , when it enters the drying chamber . following the absorption of part of the application of varnish and of the moisture from the varnish into the paper material of the printed sheet , the waste air ( arrows 30 and 31 ) is then intended as far as possible to remove the quantity of water contained in the varnish layer from the dryer units 10 and 11 in the form of vapor , in order that the varnished sheets do not glue to blocks on the stack . this material moisture from the printed sheet conveyed onward is symbolized by the arrow 7 . in addition to that , although to a low extent , moisture is also put into and removed from the printing press 1 via the powder stream ( arrow 15 ) in the delivery of the printing press and via escaping leakage air ( arrow 16 ). it has now transpired that , in a printing press of the type mentioned at the beginning , that is to say an offset printing press 1 comprising a varnishing unit 9 a , 9 b which prints water - containing varnish and one or more thermal dryer units 10 , 11 , that is to say hot air or infrared dryers , the application of varnish and the feed air 20 and the waste air 30 from the dryer units 10 a , 10 b represent the greatest inputs and outputs of moisture in the machine , that these are therefore the most important moisture streams in the balance space designated b 1 , wherein the moisture of the printed sheet passing through can be changed . in this case , it is assumed that the moisture contained in the paper fiber and in the printing ink cannot readily be driven out of the printed sheet by the dryer devices 10 a , 10 b . in the case of a machine with a double varnishing unit , as shown here , before the second varnish layer is applied by the varnishing unit 9 b , the first varnish layer should be thoroughly dried with the aid of the dryer devices 10 a and 10 b to such an extent that the varnish layer added in the second varnishing unit 9 b is laid over it without difficulty . for example , the second varnish can certainly also be uv varnish , which should not / must not react with a still moist water - based varnish . however , even if there is likewise aqueous emulsion varnish in the second varnishing unit , the first varnish layer must already have been solidified in order that the second varnish layer can be applied without difficulty , for example for the production of particularly thick overall varnish layers . the quantity of varnish applied can be adjusted in the printing press . in order to dry the sheet with the selected application of varnish in an optimum manner , the knowledge of the important operating parameters , in particular of the dryer units 10 a and 10 b and of the machine speed , easily permits an optimum result . for this purpose , however , it is necessary to know the important characteristic variables in the moisture balance . for this purpose , in the region of the printing press designated b 1 , a series of sensors is provided , with which these variables can be measured . this will be explained below by using fig3 . in order to measure the relative humidity rfl 1 and the temperature tl 1 of the feed air stream 20 , a humidity sensor 120 a and a temperature sensor 120 b are arranged in the vicinity of the air inlet ducts 121 for the dryers 10 a and 10 b . since here the relative humidity of the ambient air is measured in the print shop , a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor can be sufficient . furthermore , corresponding humidity sensors 130 c and temperature sensors 130 d and also pressure sensors 130 a and flow sensors 130 b are arranged in the waste air duct of the dryer 10 a and of the dryer 10 b . with these sensors , the quantity per unit time of the moisture stream removed from the machine can be clearly determined as the difference of the atmospheric moisture coming into the machine and coming out of the machine again . in particular , it is also possible to manage with the four aforementioned sensors 130 a to d for the waste air if the waste air ducts 131 of the two dryers 10 a and 10 b are combined . in order to measure the relative atmospheric humidity , the dew point or the absolute humidity , it is possible for example to use capacitive sensors , aspiration psychrometers or sensors which measure the moisture via the absorption of infrared radiation in the water bands . sensors which measure the relative atmospheric humidity can incidentally be arranged in a cooled measuring air stream branched off from the waste air stream , in order to increase the measuring accuracy . this is because , during cooling of the air stream , the relative humidity increases , so that the humidity measured values migrate into a region where the measuring inaccuracy is lower , assuming that no condensation of the moisture in the measuring air stream occurs . a suitable measuring cell which prevents the latter is described at the end of the illustration by using fig7 . the quantity of water input via the application of varnish is measured with flow sensors 119 in the feed and return of the varnish supply device of the printing press 1 . instead , the quantity of varnish or its proportion of water in the case of chamber - type doctor systems can also be determined from the difference between the delivery outputs of the varnish feed pump and the varnish extraction pump . taking account of the sort of varnish and its water content , which generally lies around 60 % for emulsion varnishes , the quantity of water input at this point is calculated in a straightforward manner . a further possible way of measuring the quantity of varnish consumed is to register the weight or the decrease in weight of the varnish storage container by using a weighing cell . in order to refine the method , further sensors are optionally provided , with which the water content already present in the sheet 14 running into the varnishing unit can be determined more accurately . used for this purpose is a sensor 118 , which determines the input of dampening solution 18 from the dampening solution consumption in the six printing units 8 a to f . furthermore , two temperature sensors 114 and 117 are provided , which determine the temperature of the sheet running into the varnishing unit and of the sheet leaving the dryer 110 b . these temperature sensors are used for the purpose of determining the entry and exit temperature of the sheets . on the basis of the moisture balance , supplemented by the temperature difference experienced by the material stream , an energy balance of the drying process can be drawn . for this purpose , for example , use can be made of sensors which measure the temperature of the sheet without contact via the infrared radiation emitted by the sheet . finally , in order to measure the material moisture in the feed stack 3 and in the delivery stack 7 , a mobile electronic measuring instrument can be used , for example a sword sensor or a contact sensor 103 which , for example , operates on the principle of microwave absorption or conductivity of a hydroscopic electrolyte . the signals from the sensors are processed in a computing unit 301 ( fig5 ), for example a commercially available measuring pc , to which the aforementioned sensors are connected via appropriate interface adapters . characteristic variables and conversion factors relevant to the drying process are stored in the memory 302 of the computer 301 , such as the water content of the varnish , the mathematical relationships for the conversion of relative atmospheric humidity φ into absolute humidity , as illustrated in the mollier diagram according to fig4 , to mention only a few . numeral 303 designates the keyboard of the computer , and numeral 304 designates the monitor . on this monitor , as a setting aid for the printing personnel , the important characteristic data of the current varnishing and drying process is then displayed visually , prepared in graphic form . for example , the bar 220 represents a measure of the quantity of water running into the dryers 10 with the feed air 20 , while the bar 230 indicates the quantity of water removed via the waste air . both are proportional to the air stream f through the dryer , while the bar 230 can also be enlarged within certain limits via an increase in the temperature t or the heating output of the hot air dryer or an increase in the thermal radiation of the ir dryer . the “ dryer reserve ” which may possibly still be present , that is to say the possibility of increasing the water content of the waste air still further by increasing the temperature or the ir radiation or the air flow , is illustrated on the display 304 as a further part bar designated 240 . the next bar 219 describes the quantity of water still contained in the varnish layer applied after the quantity of water input into the paper sheet and absorbed has been subtracted . on the basis of experience , this is about 50 to 60 % of the quantity of water applied to the sheet overall via the varnishing . a sheet with a dry varnish layer is obtained when the upper edge of the bar 219 does not exceed the upper edge of the bar 230 or does not exceed it substantially . the residual moisture of the varnish layer of the sheet running out of the dryer 10 b is represented as a difference in a further bar 200 . this residual moisture may be reduced firstly by reducing the application of varnish or by reducing the machine speed . this information is indicated as a help to the user in the form of corresponding symbols − l and − v with an arrow directed downward . secondly , the residual moisture 200 can also be reduced by increasing the dryer temperature + t or increasing the air throughput + f , which is likewise symbolized once more by appropriate symbols on the bar 230 . furthermore , pop - up menus 306 are used to display the exact measured values in the feed - air or waste - air duct of the dryer when the cursor 309 is brought close to the bar . a good drying result for the sheet is obtained when the application of water resulting from the application of varnish in the varnishing unit 19 a ( 100 %) corresponds approximately to the sum of the quantity of water carried away as vapor in the dryer ( 50 to 60 %) and the quantity of water absorbed into the paper underneath the varnish layer ( 40 to 50 %). in the speedmaster ® xl105 printing press mentioned at the beginning , operated at the maximum continuous printing speed of 18 , 000 sheets per hour with the sheet format 105 cm by 75 cm with a typical wet application of varnish of 3 . 5 μm , this corresponds to a water input f h2o of 29 i / h , of which , from experience , 50 % is absorbed into the paper and thus 50 % remain in the varnish . this empirical value can be determined and verified more accurately if the paper moisture of the sheet is measured after leaving the dryer or in the delivery stack . therefore , the dryer units 10 a and 10 b are expediently operated in such a way that 50 % of the water input by means of the first varnish layer , symbolized by the arrow 19 a , is removed again to the greatest extent in the form of vapor in the two dryers 10 a and 10 b . these relationships are reproduced in the mollier diagram according to fig4 . the air in the print shop has a relative humidity of 51 % at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees celsius . this corresponds to a loading with 10 g of water per kilogram of dry air ( point a ). in the hot air dryer 10 a or 10 b , this feed air is heated to 80 ° c . and then still has a relative humidity of 3 . 4 % ( point b ). however , this changes nothing in the loading with 10 grams of water per kilogram of dry air . following the contact of the heated feed air with the moist , varnished sheet , the waste air extracted from the dryer units 10 a and 10 b has a temperature of 58 degrees celsius and a relative humidity of 12 . 7 %. this corresponds to a loading with 14 . 5 grams of water per kilogram of dry air ( point c ). the relative humidity can also be measured in a cooled waste air bypass at 35 degrees celsius . there , it then has a relative humidity of φ = 0 . 4 , but this changes nothing in its loading with 14 . 5 grams of water per kilogram of dry air ( point d ). during the operation at a continuous printing speed v of 18 , 000 sheets per hour , the blowers of the dryers 10 a and 10 b blow a volume flow of v = 3000 cubic meters of air per hour or 3300 kg of ( dry ) air per hour through the dryer units . in this way , therefore , measured as a difference from the water or moisture stream already contained in the feed air , 15 kilograms of water vapor per hour therefore leave the printing press in the region of the dryer . the illustration according to fig5 shows clearly that the residual moisture of the sheet leaving the dryer 10 b can be influenced not only via increasing the heating output or via the quantity of water or water vapor removed by the waste air but by exerting an influence on a series of further variables . for instance , in addition to the classic measures such as reducing the application of varnish or lowering the machine speed , an influence can also be exerted on the drying results in a demonstrable way by using predried air or reducing the moisture of the sheet running into the varnishing unit . an alternative possible way of visualizing the measured results from the sensors is illustrated in fig6 . here , the part of the printing press 1 containing the dryers 110 a and b and the varnishing unit 9 a is illustrated , and the measured values from the sensors are blended in as values , arrows directly representing the connection between the measuring locations of the sensors and the indicated measured values for the relative humidity rf , temperature t , pressure p and varnish flow rate fl . in this representation , it is possible to change from the display of the actual values to a display of the deviation from desired values themselves set or , for example , determined from an earlier job and then stored , for temperature , humidity and quantity of varnish . in the event that tolerance limits are exceeded , error messages can additionally be made visible on the monitor . in the same way as for the balance space of the varnishing and drying via the first varnishing unit 9 a of the printing press 1 , a balance space b 2 for the second varnishing unit 9 b and also the dryers 11 a to d can also be built up for the printing press 1 and displayed . for the purpose of the graphical representation of the second balance space on the monitor 304 ( fig5 ), by means of appropriate entries via the keyboard 303 of the computer 301 , the monitor display can be switched over appropriately and switched over to the sensors arranged in the feed air 21 and waste air 31 , respectively , and to sensors measuring the varnish stream 19 b . moreover , the computer 301 has a data line 307 , which connects it to the machine control system of the printing press . in this way , it is possible for changes made interactively on the monitor in the heating output or in the air volume flow of the dryers , the quantity of varnish applied and the machine speed to be transmitted directly to the machine control system and not to have to be made separately there . in fig7 , a measuring cell for the more accurate measurement of the relative humidity in the waste air from the dryers 10 a / 10 b is described : the measuring cell has a pot - like or box - like housing 401 , which is provided at the bottom with an air inlet connecting piece 402 and offset opposite , approximately centrally in relation to the wall of the pot - like or box - like housing , and has an air outlet connecting piece 403 . the air inlet connecting piece 402 has a very much larger cross section than the air outlet connecting piece 403 , in order that the pressure level does not change in the measuring cell but corresponds approximately to the pressure of the main stream of the dryer waste air , from which the measuring stream is branched off . a coarse grid 404 in the air inlet connecting piece prevents foreign bodies penetrating into the measuring cell . a finer dust filter 405 divides the measuring cell between the air inlet connecting piece and the air outlet connecting piece . because of its large diameter , which corresponds to that of the measuring cell , the dust filter 405 does not represent any flow resistance worth mentioning . it divides the volume of the measuring cell into an inlet region 415 , wherein the air still has the temperature and humidity of the main waste air stream , and into a measuring volume 416 , wherein the air is cooled , as explained below , and is measured with regard to temperature and relative atmospheric humidity . the cover of the measuring cell is formed by a ring 418 , wherein a peltier element 410 is accommodated . the peltier element is provided on both sides with heat sinks , the heat sink 414 keeping the “ hot ” side of the peltier element at ambient temperature , which is assisted by a fan 413 . peltier element 410 , heat sink 414 and fan 413 form a commercially available structural unit , as used for example for cooling electronic components . such structural units can be obtained relatively inexpensively . the intermediate ring 418 consists of thermally insulating material , in order to prevent a thermal short circuit between the two sides of the peltier element . a grid 406 of metal rests on the heat sink 407 on the “ cold ” side of the peltier element 410 . the grid 406 has a relatively coarse mesh and permits the passage of air between the measuring volume 416 and the sensor region located beneath . the grid 406 is in thermal contact with the heat sink 407 and therefore assumes the temperature of the latter . on account of the very large surface of heat sink 407 and grid 406 , the air passing out of the measuring volume 416 through the grid 406 and reaching the sensor 408 assumes the temperature of the heat sink . this is kept at about 35 ° c ., in order to prevent the moisture in the air condensing out in the region of the sensor . the sensor 408 is an inexpensive , commercially available sensor for measuring the relative atmospheric humidity and the temperature , such as is sold , for example , by the company sensirion inc , westlake village , calif ., usa , under the product designation sht75 . the two values , the value of the relative atmospheric humidity and the temperature measured value , are used to determine the absolute humidity in the waste air from the dryers 10 a / 10 b , as described by using the other figures . at the same time , the temperature measuring element of the sensor 408 is used to regulate the temperature in the measuring cell to values between about 25 ° and 40 ° c ., which are uncritical with respect to the condensation of water vapor , with the aid of the peltier element 410 . additional protection against condensation may be achieved by the measured signal of the relative humidity also being taken into account . for example , in the event that rf & gt ; 80 % is exceeded , the temperature in the measuring volume 416 can be raised by the peltier element 410 being used for heating by reversing the polarity of the current direction . in that case , the peltier element 410 can be controlled and regulated with the aid of the humidity signal and the temperature signal from the sensor 408 in such a way that the sensor always operates in a climatic range which is uncritical with regard to the condensation of vapor but optimal in relation to the measuring accuracy of the humidity measurement . in the present example , the invention has been described by using a moisture balance that is set up since , in the case of emulsion varnishes , the important material streams contain water . besides this , it is possible in the same way , for example when using varnishes based on ( organic ) solvents , to balance the input and output of the solvents , for example of the ipa ( isopropanol ), and to provide this balance visually through the printer for the optimization .",1
"referring now to fig1 a specific embodiment of a gps receiver system 10 is shown . the system 10 includes an antenna array 12 having plurality of antenna elements 14 , where the components comprising each antenna &# 34 ; leg portion &# 34 ; 15 are substantially identical . in the illustrated embodiment , each antenna element 14 is coupled to a front - end amplifier 16 , the output of which is supplied to a down - converter 18 to convert the signal to an intermediate frequency for processing . each down - converted signal is supplied to weighting circuitry or a &# 34 ; weight &# 34 ; 20 that multiplies the signal by a complex weight value ( having real and imaginary portions ). the outputs of all of the weighting circuits 20 are coupled to a summing circuit 22 , as shown . the term &# 34 ; weight ,&# 34 ; &# 34 ; weight value ,&# 34 ; and &# 34 ; weighting circuit &# 34 ; are used interchangeably . in the illustrated embodiment of fig1 the sum of the signals is then coupled to a power detector circuit 24 and is also supplied to a gps receiver 26 . the output of the power detector circuit 24 is then converted to a digital signal by an analog to digital converter 28 . the digital signal is then processed by an adaptive algorithm ( described hereinafter ) under control of a microprocessor or other suitable computer or processor 30 . alternately , dedicated or discrete hardware circuitry may be used in place of the microprocessor 30 . in the illustrated embodiment of fig1 the microprocessor 30 adjusts the values of the weight values for each antenna element 14 and iteratively processes the digital signal attempting to constantly improve the signal received by the gps receiver 26 . additionally , navigational data , such as data provided by an inertial navigation system ( ins or nav system ) 32 may be utilized by the adaptive algorithm under control of the microprocessor 30 . typically , a wide - band front - end filter is coupled between the antenna 14 and the amplifier 16 . however , its placement may differ from the specific embodiment of fig1 and may not be included in all embodiments . in the illustrated embodiment of fig1 only a single set of weights 20 is required . one weight 20 corresponds to one antenna element 14 . therefore , the single set of weights corresponds to the array 12 of antenna elements 14 , which is optimized for all of the gps satellites . the nav system 32 provides information with respect to the position and / or orientation of the receiver ( the antenna array of the receiver ) which permits the system 10 to solve for the gain of the received gps signal in the direction of each satellite . in the embodiment of fig1 one set of weights 20 in combination with the nav data is used to optimize the average signal to noise ratio ( snr ). accordingly , the gain of the received gps signal is increased . to perform this optimization of the snr in the embodiment of fig1 the total power received by the antenna array 12 is divided by the measurement bandwidth to obtain a &# 34 ; noise floor .&# 34 ; using the positional information provided by the nav system 32 , the gain in the direction of the satellite may be obtained . this value can then be used as the criteria for increasing the snr by adjusting the value of the weights 20 via an adaptive algorithm , such as a &# 34 ; hill climbing &# 34 ; algorithm . therefore , instead of merely reducing the total power received , as is done in known power minimization techniques , the present invention adjusts the weights 20 to maximize the snr , meaning that the signal strength of the received gps signal is boosted , while simultaneously minimizing the jamming signal . because each antenna element 14 is part of the antenna array 12 , each element has a different carrier phase due to its relative position with respect to each satellite . gps receiver systems utilizing an antenna array 12 are useful for nulling the effects of broad band jamming signals . in some situations , multiple jammer signals may be present . to null - out &# 34 ; n &# 34 ; number of different jammer signals , &# 34 ; n + 1 &# 34 ; individual antenna elements 14 are utilized . for example , four antenna elements 14 are used to effectively null - out three jammer signals . the gps signal is &# 34 ; buried &# 34 ; in the background noise . one aspect of the present invention utilizes the fact that the gps signal is extremely weak relative to the strength of the jammer signal . additionally , the jamming signal typically emanates from a different direction than that of the gps signal . often , the gps signal is transmitted from a satellite that is relatively &# 34 ; high &# 34 ; in sky , while the jamming signal is transmitted from a tower or mobile vehicle located on the ground . hence , the signals arrive from different directions . of course , if the jamming signal emanates from an airborne platform and is at the same relative position as that of the satellite , no difference in the angle of arrival between the gps signal and the jammer signal would be seen , and nulling would be very difficult . however , this is a rare occurrence and would only be temporary . as described above , the illustrated embodiment of the system 10 of fig1 utilizes a single set of weights 20 for the entire antenna array 12 . for each antenna element 14 , processing the signal in accordance with the weight 20 causes the phase and / or amplitude of the received signal to be modified in an attempt to &# 34 ; steer &# 34 ; a null in the direction of the jamming signal to reduce its received signal strength , while simultaneously increasing the gain of the received signal in the direction of the gps satellite . referring now to fig2 there is illustrated an example of an implementation of the above - described process for an analog gps system . the illustrated specific example is generally referred to as a &# 34 ; hill - climbing &# 34 ; method . however , other methods in addition to &# 34 ; hill - climbing &# 34 ; methods may be used ( including but not limited to such known techniques as matrix inversion , which may be used in digital gps systems ). the process begins , as shown at a step 100 . first , an initial set of weight values is selected as a starting point , as shown at a step 102 . for example , a weight of &# 34 ; 1 &# 34 ; may be selected which provides no phase shift and no modification in amplitude . of course , any weight may be used as an initial starting point . as shown in a step 104 , a power level p coming out of the antenna array is measured . this is the measured power contributed by each antenna element as it is modified by whatever weight value is implemented . the output of each antenna element is summed and routed to power detecting circuitry , as is shown in fig1 . the power level term p in the illustrated example is preferably divided by the measurement bandwidth bw , for example , a 20 mhz bandwidth . thus , p / bw provides the &# 34 ; noise floor &# 34 ; term referred to as n 0 measured in watts per hertz . this represents a background noise level and includes the transmitted satellite signals in addition to any jammer signals which may be present . the following equation governs : using the information with respect to the satellite locations and the orientation of the receiving platform supplied by the nav system , in addition to knowing the value of the weights , the gain g of the antenna array as a whole , in the direction of each satellite is obtained , as shown in a step 106 . accordingly , the gain g of the antenna array as a whole is obtained , as is known in the art using conventional methods . next , an estimate of the received satellite signal power sp at the input of the antenna array is calculated , as shown in a step 108 . the gps satellites are known to provide a worst - case signal power level of about - 163 dbw on the surface of the earth . however , this level may increase depending upon the elevation of the satellite relative to the receiver ( antenna array ). depending upon the elevation angle of the satellite , which is known via the nav system and almanac data , the satellite signal power sp is estimated . the value of sp may , for example , may range from about - 163 dbw to - 150 dbw . equation 2 : snr α c / n 0 , where c is the signal power at the output of the antenna array . given equation 2 above , and using the estimated satellite power sp , the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) corresponding to each satellite is obtained , where ( snr ) α ( c / n 0 ) and c α ( g * sp ), as shown in a step 110 . the terms are proportional to each other , related by bandwidth . this value is calculated for each satellite because the value of gain g corresponds to a specific satellite . the term &# 34 ; snr &# 34 ; is used interchangeably with the term &# 34 ; c / n 0 &# 34 ; although the two terms are not necessarily equal to each other , but rather , proportional to each other . and solving for the value of snr yields equation 4 below : next , as shown in a step 111 , the average snr is calculated by summing the calculated snr values for each satellite and dividing the total by the number of satellites . in a step 112 , the average snr is compared to the previous average snr value found , assuming that the above process has been iteratively repeated . of course , in the first iteration of the above - described steps , no prior average snr value will exist . the goal is to adjust the weights to obtain the highest value of the average snr . the weights are adjusted according to a predetermined pattern to obtain the best possible value of the average snr . if the present adjustment to the weight value causes an improvement in the average snr value relative to the previous weight values , then adjustment of the weight value continues in that direction according to the predetermined pattern , as shown in a step 118 . if the present adjustment to the weight value causes an degradation in the average snr value relative to the previous weight value , then adjustment of the weight proceeds in the opposite direction with the same weight , as shown in a step 120 . alternately , rather than proceeding in the opposite direction as shown in the step 120 , the next weight may be selected for adjustment . this process is repeated so that all weight values are optimized . the process branches back to the step 104 so that the steps 104 through 120 are continuously repeated to obtain the best possible average snr values . the processes shown in the steps 118 and 120 where the weight adjustment &# 34 ; scheme &# 34 ; is adjusted may be implemented , for example , by using a coarse step adjustment followed by a fine step adjustment . in this approach , adjustment of the weight is initially performed using a coarse step size to obtain the best possible snr measurement of all of the possible coarse steps available . once the best coarse step is obtained , fine tuning may be performed using small step sizes within the coarse step . this prevents &# 34 ; falling &# 34 ; into a localized minimum or maximum . referring now to fig3 - 12 the histograms show comparisons of the signal to noise ratio ( c / n 0 ) for a specific satellite geometry that includes for example , four satellites and two jammers . with respect to calculating the data points comprising the histograms , the following assumptions have been made : 4 . the sum of the thermal noise and the antenna noise at each element is equal to - 202 dbw / hz . 5 . the signal strength of the gps received signal is - 163 dbw . 8 . the satellites and the jammers are placed randomly over a +/- 86 ° angle in azimuth and elevation . 9 . the antenna array is perfectly calibrated and the estimates of received signals are perfectly accurate . referring now to fig3 - 5 , the histograms show the difference between the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) achieved using a known power minimization algorithm compared to the snr achieved using the present beam forming approach described above . the top frame of each of the figures are obtained on a satellite by satellite basis , while the bottom frame of each of the figures is obtained based on the average of the four satellites in each geometry . as shown , the present beam forming approach is significantly superior to the known power minimization or simple null steering techniques . referring now to fig6 - 8 , the histograms shown in the figures illustrate the advantages of the present beam forming technique ( using multiple antenna elements ) and power minimization or null steering techniques ( using multiple antenna elements ), compared to a single element antenna obtained on a per satellite basis . of course , the amount of benefit obtained depends on the amount of jamming that is present . this is to be expected because the strength of the present spatial nulling technique is based on steering nulls in the direction of the jammer signals , rather than nulling thermal noise . when jamming signal levels are low , use of known power minimization techniques are detrimental to the signal to noise ratio , and such techniques should not be used . in contrast , the present beam forming technique provides an improvement over the full range of jamming signal strengths . referring now to fig9 - 11 , the histograms show the improvement in the average signal to noise ratio over a single element antenna for the beam forming and for known power minimization techniques . as shown in the figures , known power minimization techniques disadvantageously permit the signal to noise ratio to drop to a level lower than it would normally be when using a single element antenna . this occurs when jamming levels are low . as shown in the histograms , the present beam forming technique does not permit this anomaly to occur . note that fig3 - 11 involve matrix inversion techniques for both power minimization and beam forming techniques . referring now to fig1 , the histograms show the difference in signal to noise ratio levels between a matrix inversion approach and a hill climbing approach . the top frame of the figure represents a per satellite approach while the bottom frame of the figure represents an average of four satellites in each geometry . referring now to fig1 , the histogram illustrates the improvement in signal to noise ratio using the matrix inversion technique and the hill climbing technique over a single element antenna , on a per satellite basis . referring now to fig1 , the histogram shows the improvement in signal to noise ratio using the matrix inversion technique and the hill climbing technique over a single element antenna based on the average of the four satellites in each geometry . as shown in the above figures , use of the hill climbing technique in the present inventive method typically attains results within three to five decibels of an optimal level . occasionally , the hill climbing technique may be come &# 34 ; stuck &# 34 ; at a local maximum . however , in practice , the hill climbing technique does not terminate , and changing conditions would obviate this problem by overcoming the local maximum condition . specific embodiments of a method and apparatus for reducing jamming using beam forming with navigational data according to the present invention have been described for the purpose of illustrating the manner in which the invention may be made and used . it should be understood that implementation of other variations and modifications of the invention and its various aspects will be apparent to those skilled in the art , and that the invention is not limited by the specific embodiments described . it is therefore contemplated to cover by the present invention any and all modifications , variations , or equivalents that fall within the true spirit and scope of the basic underlying principles disclosed and claimed herein .",7
"to describe the features of the container of the invention , we shall firstly describe the method for the production thereof . two pieces of plastic strip 2 , e . g . pet or pvc , with a thickness of 125 microns , are affixed ( for example glued using vinyl glue ) to a sheet of cardboard 1 ( or other material suitable to form the container ) ( fig1 ). subsequently , with the use of an automatic machine of well - known type , a punching and creasing operation is performed on the cardboard 1 , through which the blank , represented in a plan view and in enlarged scale in fig3 , is separated from the remaining part of the cardboard . it can already be noted that this blank is provided with crease or fold lines ( from 3 to 6 ) which separate from one another five different and consecutive portions of cardboard designed to form — in the finished container — a bottom wall 7 , a front wall 8 , a rear wall 9 , a top wall 10 and a front wall which is divided into two parts 11 and 11 a by a predetermined and facilitated tearing line or knurling 12 : a shaped cut is produced in the part 11 a , which delimits therein an appendix 13 integral with the part 11 and suitable to be inserted ( as will be explained hereunder ) in a shaped opening 14 produced in the wall 8 . the fold or crease line 3 is composed of a discontinuous series of short segments of crease ( mutually connecting the walls 7 and 8 ) separated from one another by a series of saw tooth cuts 15 produced through punching in the wall 8 . similarly , a series of short rectilinear cuts 16 , separated from one another by a group of tooth cuts 17 forming part of a series of saw tooth cuts 17 , are produced in the part 11 a of the front wall . from the figures it can also be noted that tabs ( not numbered for simplicity ) project from the ends of all the aforesaid walls , these tabs being designed to close the two ends of the container that is obtained at the end of all the assembly operations described hereunder . the structure of the piece of cardboard blank described above is already known and is similar to the one illustrated in the prior art patents ep0369346b and u . s . pat . no . 4 , 967 , 911 mentioned in the introduction of the present description . an advantageous feature of the present invention consists in the presence of strips of plastic material 2 glued onto one ( or if necessary onto both of the opposite surfaces of the sheet of cardboard 1 ) and , simultaneously , in the fact that the saw tooth cuts 15 and 17 ( and also the series of short cuts 16 ) are obtained by simultaneous punching both on the sheet of cardboard 1 and on the pieces of strip 2 affixed thereto : it has been found that , in this manner , the teeth 15 , 17 ( which have the function of causing tearing of the thin foil of web material unwound from its roll enclosed in the container ) have a much greater resistance to deformation thereof than they would have if they were not covered , on one or both the faces thereof , by the protective layer of the plastic strip . it is evident that the plastic strip 2 is provided in those areas of the cardboard provided with the toothings having the function of causing tearing of the thin foil material which the container is designed to contain . we shall now return to consider fig2 which shows the cardboard on which , after affixing of the pieces of strip 2 , the punching and creasing operations have been performed , already described and at the end of which the blank shown in fig3 is separated from the cardboard . it is important to note that , as a result of the fact that the short rectilinear cuts 16 and the saw tooth cuts 17 produced ( during the punching operation of the cardboard ) in the part 11 a of the front wall form a single continuous longitudinal cut , when the blank of fig3 detaches from the punched cardboard a portion of the strip 2 remains attached to the cardboard frame 1 ( which is discarded ), separating from the other portion of strip which remains affixed to the part 11 a of the front wall of the container : the cuts 16 and the teeth 17 thus form a continuous series delimiting the free edge of the part 11 a designed to form part of the front wall of the container . to form the container starting from the blank of fig3 , this blank is turned over , so that it is as shown in fig4 . at this point the cardboard is folded about the fold line 4 ( fig5 ), placing the wall 7 over the wall 9 and the wall 8 over the wall 10 , then applying a layer of glue 20 along the free longitudinal edge of the portion of wall 11 a ( fig5 ); the cardboard is then folded over itself along the fold line 6 , placing the portion of wall 11 over the wall 10 and affixing ( through the layer of glue 20 ) the portion of wall 11 a to the wall 8 ( fig6 ). as can be noted in fig6 , the teeth 17 of the part 11 a of the front wall of the cardboard are placed over the fold lines 3 of the wall 8 , the cusps or tips of these teeth 17 projecting slightly beyond the respective fold lines 3 , while the teeth 15 are placed over the cuts 16 , also projecting slightly over and beyond these cuts . at this point the operations for industrial production of the container are terminated and , by exerting a force for mutual approach ( in the direction shown schematically by the arrows a - a in fig6 ), the container assumes a square shape which delimits a trapezoidal cavity defined by a bottom wall 7 , by a front wall 8 , by a rear wall 9 and by a top wall 10 from which an end wall 11 , 11 a extends , placed over the front wall 8 and divided into the two portions 11 , 11 a by the transverse and tearable knurling 12 . a roll 30 of thin foil material 31 ( fig1 ), a portion of which can be unwound and torn from the roll 30 , can be inserted in the assembled container described above ( through the ends of the container , still open ). as in the closed container containing the roll 30 the portion of wall 11 , 11 a is glued to the outer surface of the wall 8 , to open this container it is necessary and sufficient to break the wall 11 , 11 a along the tearing line 12 : in this manner the portion of wall 11 a will remain fixed and glued to the wall 8 , while the portion of wall 11 can be lifted upward ( together with the wall 10 ), rotating about the fold line 5 : it will thus be possible to grasp the free edge of the thin foil 31 and pulling it out of the container — to unwind from the roll 30 a portion of the desired length which can then be easily torn ( and removed ) by pressing it against the teeth 15 and 17 delimiting the lower front corner of the container ( fig7 and 10 ). for greater clarity , fig8 and 9 represent , in enlarged scale , two ( partial ) sections of the container , taken according to the lines 8 - 8 and 9 - 9 of fig7 . from these fig7 , 8 and 9 , the most important feature of the container described above can easily be perceived . it is seen that a substantial part of the teeth 17 ( projecting from the portion of wall 11 a which is glued to the wall 8 , is resting on and held pressed on the this wall 8 , while only a small portion ( the cusps ) of these teeth 17 project beyond the lower surface of the wall 7 ; and that a substantial part of the teeth 15 ( projecting from the wall 7 ) is resting on and supported by the free edges of the cuts 16 , while only a small portion ( the cusps ) of these teeth projects beyond the outer surface of the part of wall 11 a . therefore , along the entire front and lower corner of the container there is provided a continuous cutting edge formed by the series of teeth 15 and 17 , which are practically non - deformable under the thrust of the foil 31 which is torn from the roll 30 . it is evident that the structure of the container for the roll of thin foil material can differ from the one represented in the accompanying drawings . this structure can be of any known shape for the object at which the present invention is aimed ; for example , the container can have the shape of any one of the containers described in the prior art patents already cited or have the toothed edge produced solely on the free edge of the wall 8 or on the free edge of the portion of wall 11 a , or yet another solution . it is advantageous that the teeth designed to cut the thin foil material extracted from the container are protected and covered , a least on one surface thereof , by a layer or strip of plastic material or the like ( e . g . a thin foil of metal , such as a foil of aluminium ) in which the toothing for tearing is produced by punching simultaneously to the toothing produced in the sheet of cardboard or the like .",1
"in the detailed discussion that follows , various applications of the invention to dental implant design will be described , followed by examples of bone implants and prosthetic devices , and concluding with a description of alternative methods for making the previously described implant structures and for emplacing them in the intended body location . in the drawings , the same or similar features will be identified by the same reference number in each figure for convenience . the need for a tooth implant may arise from a variety of causes , and each situation may require a different implant structure . in addition , the type of tooth being replaced ( e . g . molar , bicuspid or incisor ) and its location in the mouth will affect the required shape of the implant support or root , both because each tooth encounters a different stress and because the alveolar ridge at the front of the mouth is normally narrower than at the rear . the location of the maxillary sinus cavities in the upper jaw may also affect the shape of the implant support . consequently , the present invention contemplates a range of sizes , shapes , and constructions , as illustrated by the following drawings of tooth implant embodiments . all of the different designs incorporate , however , the underlying concept of pore size and porosity depending upon the type of tissue ingrowth that is desired . fig1 through 5 illustrate several embodiments for use when replacing an existing tooth in a socket having normal alveolar bone height . in these drawings , as well as in all subsequent drawings representing in situ conditions , the anatomical details are rendered in a formalized schematic manner for simplicity . referring to fig1 a plastic replica tooth implant 101 comprises a hard plastic tooth crown 102 integrally molded with a porous plastic tooth root 103 . the term replica will be used to refer to a tooth implant or other plastic implant structure that has the exact size and shape of the tooth or bone that it replaces . such a replica will normally be cast in a mold that has been prepared using the original tooth or bone as the model for the mold . in this case the tooth replica 101 has been set in an alveolar cavity 104 of the lower jawbone or mandible 105 . the jawbone is composed of a cortical or outer bone portion 106 and an inner spongy medullary portion 107 . the example of fig1 illustrates a mandible having a normal alveolar height ; i . e ., the tooth socket extends well up near the top of the root portion of the implant . above the jawbone lies the dermis 108 with the outer covering of the gums or gingiva 109 extending up to the top of the porous root portion of the implant . fig1 illustrates the situation after the implant has become fully attached to the alveolar socket by means of a periodontal membrane 110 and to the gingiva by an epithelial attachment 111 . in addition , hard bone ingrowth 112 has occurred through two holes 113 and 114 drilled in the root portion of the replica , each hole being approximately 2 to 3 millimeters in diameter . finally , fibrous tissue ingrowth 115 , that constitutes an extension of the periodontal membrane , has occurred between the alveolar bone and the intermediate root portion of the tooth replica . as a consequence , the tooth implant is firmly attached both to the underlying jawbone and to the overlying gingiva in a manner completely simulating the environment of a natural healthy tooth . fig2 illustrates a replica 101 that is the same as the replica of fig1 . in this case the replica has been cemented into the alveolar cavity by a suitable cement , such as methyl polyacrylate ( carboxylate ) cement , glass - ceramic cement , or a cement known as kodak 9 - 10 manufactured by the eastman kodak company . in this embodiment the cement coating in the root portion of the replica provides an initial strong attachment to the jawbone , which is then supplemented over a period of weeks by ingrowth of periodontal tissue as described above . the next two figs ., 3 and 4 , illustrate two embodiments of a replica tooth implant formed by a two - stage technique . in these embodiments , the root portion is cast first and inserted in the alveolar socket . in the embodiment of fig3 the root portion comprises a hard plastic insert 117 that extends , either partially or almost fully , to the bottom of the root and is surrounded by porous plastic 118 as illustrated . the possible range of lengths of the hard plastic insert 117 is shown between the dash line 119 and the solid line 120 on the drawing . after the root portion has been installed for a period of several weeks ; so that connective tissue has had a chance to develop between the lower root and the alveolar socket and between the gingiva and the upper root , a preformed acrylic crown 121 can be attached to the upper portion 122 of the hard plastic insert that extends above the porous plastic root by any conventional cementing technique . in this way the implant support or root is protected by the adjacent teeth against the normal stresses exerted on a tooth crown during the critical period while the attachment membranes are forming between the root and the surrounding socket and gingiva . if desired , any conventional crown material other than acrylic , for example a porcelain jacket or acrylic veneers , can be used for the finished tooth . in fig3 the hard plastic pin 122 provides reinforcement in the upper portion of what is primarily a porous plastic root . in the embodiment of fig4 on the other hand , a hard plastic root replica 123 is coated with a relatively thin porous plastic outer covering 124 to provide a surface that will promote ingrowth of the periodontal membrane and the connective tissue at the gingival contact area . the embodiment of fig4 is like the fig3 embodiment in that the tooth crown 121 is cemented to the exposed mounting post of the hard plastic root 123 after the root has become fixed in the alveolar socket . this process normally takes only a few weeks at the most . occasionally in cases of gum disease , a sound natural tooth will become loose in its socket . in such a situation , it may be possible to use the tooth itself as the base for a dental implant . fig5 a and 5b show a natural tooth 125 that has been extracted , the root portion 126 etched with phosphoric acid , a thin coating 127 of porous plastic applied to the root portion , and the tooth reinserted in its socket . when this procedure is accompanied and followed by the proper treatment for alleviating the underlying problems of the gum disease , the result is a recreation of the necessary periodontal membrane ingrowth in the lower root portion and epithelial attachment of the gingiva with the upper portion of the porous plastic coating to produce firm fixation of the tooth in its socket and a return to normal and healthy periodontal conditions . as stated above , the tooth implant embodiment of fig1 and 2 is formed as an exact replica of a natural tooth by using the latter , immediately following extraction , as a pattern for a plaster mold fashioned by conventional flasking techniques . after the mold has set , the root portion is filled with a flowable mixture of acrylic plastic and leachable crystals of predetermined size . the crown portion of the mold is then filled with pure acrylic polymer / monomer mixture and the entire flask placed in boiling water until the replica casting has hardened . the cast replica is then removed from the mold and the crystals leached from the root , thereby creating the desired porosity . the details of this procedure are described in the final portion of the specification . the two - step procedure for the implant of fig3 differs from the one - step implants above in that a plaster mold of only the root of the extracted tooth is made in the first step . a hard ( solid ) plastic pin is placed in the mold before filling the remainder with the mixture of plastic and leachable crystals . the lower end of the pin serves to reinforce the root structure , while the upper end extends above the root to act as a mounting post for the preformed crown that is installed in the second step of the procedure . in making the embodiment of fig5 a , the tooth root , after it has been etched with phosphoric acid , is coated with wax and then pressed back into its socket . in this way , the wax coating takes an exact snug impression of the tooth socket . then the plaster mold is made in the usual way . the tooth is removed from the mold , dipped in boiling water to remove the wax , and replaced in the mold . the space previously occupied by the wax is then filled with a mixture of polymer , monomer , and leachable crystals , which is then processed to form the porous plastic coating . instead of , or in addition to , premixing the leachable crystals with the polymer - monomer mixture , the crystals can be attached to the interior surface of the mold before the mixture is added , thereby increasing the porosity at the surface . the embodiment of fig4 is made in the same way as that of fig5 a except that the etched root of the natural tooth may be used as a pattern to make a hard plastic replica , formed with a crown mounting post at the top , that becomes the core of the implant . alternatively , the hard plastic core may be selected from an assortment of prefabricated root shapes and sizes . this embodiment provides a structural strength comparable to the natural tooth by using a maximum amount of hard plastic in the root portion , and can be used when the natural tooth is not suitable ( because of decay , fracture , or other defects ). turning next to fig6 through 9 , these figures illustrate various implant tecnniques and embodiments for use in situations where the alveolar height is abnormally low . fig6 depicts a natural tooth 128 in situ in the alveolar cavity 129 of a mandible 130 , having cortical bone portion 131 and inner spongy bone portion 132 . in fig6 the height of the alveolar bone is abnormally low , causing the gums ( gingiva ) 133 and the underlying dermis 134 to recede , thereby exposing intermediate root portion 135 between the tooth crown portion 136 and the lower root portion 137 that is held in the socket by periodontal membrane 138 . this is an atrophied condition of the periodontal environment that causes gradual deterioration and ultimate loss of the natural tooth , followed by a strong tendency for alveolar resorption unless appropriate dental countermeasures are undertaken promptly . assuming that the atrophy of the jawbone and resulting damage to the natural tooth has progressed to the point where extraction of the tooth is required , fig7 - 9 illustrate three approaches to the problem of rebuilding the alveolar ridge and fixating a replacement tooth . in fig7 the natural tooth has been removed , treated in exactly the same way as the embodiment of fig5 and replaced in its socket . the porous plastic coating 139 is strongly bonded to the etched root 140 and , in turn , provides a superior surface for encouraging the ingrowth of periodontal membrane cells in the alveolar socket . at the time that the tooth is extracted , the dermis is also undercut along each side of the jawbone , as indicated by lines 141 and 142 . then after the treated tooth has been replaced in its socket , the dermis and overlying gingiva are pulled up to the normal gum line of the tooth and sutured in place . within a few weeks , new periodontal membrane tissue 143 will grow upward from the jawbone and attach firmly to the porous plastic surface on the previously exposed intermediate portion of the tooth root . concurrently , the gingiva will form an epithelial attachment to the upper margin of the porous plastic coating . thus , the reparative approach taken with this embodiment is to encourage the formation and attachment of fibrous connective tissue to the previously exposed root portion of the natural tooth . after a period of natural growth and adaptation , a desired normal gingival condition results , as shown by gingiva 132 disposed at the base of crown portion 144 , with the root portion properly embedded in alveolar cavity 129 with fibrous connective attachments 138 in alveolar cavity 139 and new connective tissue 143 creating the effect of a normal alveolar ridge . fig8 shows an embodiment of a tooth implant 145 , of the same type as that of fig1 that has been inserted in alveolar cavity 129 to replace the natural tooth shown in fig6 . this embodiment is formed as an exact replica of the natural tooth by using the latter as a model for a plaster mold fashioned by conventional flasking techniques , just as described in connection with fig6 . thus , replica embodiment 145 of fig8 comprises a hard ( i . e . solid ) cast polymer crown 146 integrally formed with a porous plastic root portion 147 . in this case , however , the alveolar ridge has been built up artificially at the time of inserting the implant by packing synthetic bone 148 around the exposed intermediate portion of the root . the synthetic bone used to form the alveolar ridge in this and following examples preferably is composed of large pore cast porous polymer ( e . g . polymethyl methacrylate ) having pore sizes in the range of 200 - 400 microns . other conventional synthetic bone materials can be used , however , such as porous ceramic titanium dioxide ( tio 2 ), glass ceramic , calcium phosphate ( ca 3 ( po 4 ) 2 ), or biodegradable polymer ( lactic acid ). after the dermis has been undercut and the gingiva pulled up and sutured in place , new connective tissue attachments 149 and 150 will occur between the implant and the synthetic alveolar ridge and between the synthetic ridge and the contiguous dermis , respectively . referring to fig9 a and 9b , the two - step procedure described in connection with fig3 and 4 can also be used in the situation of inadequate alveolar height . the example of fig9 a and 9b uses a replica root embodiment similar to that of fig3 with a built - up alveolar ridge of synthetic bone , as in the example of fig8 . the replica root includes a solid plastic insert 151 , having an exposed crown mounting post 152 and a reinforcing root portion 153 surrounded by a porous plastic jacket 154 . two holes 155 and 156 are provided for additional fixation by means of hard bone ingrowth . as in the case of the one - step implant , the dermis is undercut and the gingiva pulled up around the upper margin of the porous plastic jacket , where it is held in place by sutures 157 . in some cases , as shown by fig1 , alveolar bone resorption will create a trough 158 around the natural tooth 159 . this situation can be treated in two ways . in the first procedure , porous synthetic bone material 159 ( preferably polymethyl methacrylate with 200 - 400 micron pores ) is packed around the intermediate portions of roots 160 and 161 to replace the lost alveolar bone . the second procedure is used when the tooth is loose and includes the additional steps of first extracting the tooth , etching the root , sealing the end of the root canal , and replacing the tooth in its socket before packing the synthetic bone material around it . the root etching procedure produces a roughened surface that promotes a good attachment to the periodontal membrane . if necessary , a porous plastic coating can be added , according to the previously described techniques . as in the procedures illustrated by fig7 - 9 , the dermis should be undercut and the gingiva raised to the former gum line and sutured until connective tissue ingrowth has occurred . the previous examples have all dealt with replacement of a single existing tooth by using the extracted tooth , either as a pattern for a cast plastic replica or , by suitable treatment , as its own replacement . fig1 and 12 illustrate a procedure for replacing a group of from two to five teeth by means of a multiple implant in two steps or stages . this procedure can be used both in the situation where all the replaced teeth are missing and there is very little alveolar bone height or where the group of teeth are all periodontally involved and must be removed . in the first stage , an artificial alveolar ridge 162 of porous plastic is cast , using a wax impression or similar material as a pattern for a plaster mold by conventional techniques . solid plastic inserts 163 may be cast integrally with the artificial ridge or may be cemented in place subsequently , as desired . the entire ridge structure is then placed in mating contact with mandible 164 , ( having alveolar canal 165 ) and the previously undercut gums 166 sutured in place around the inserts , leaving crown mounting posts 167 exposed . because the gingiva will not form an epithelial attachment with the smooth surface of the inserts , the exposed portions between the top of the artificial ridge and the base of the mounting posts should be covered with a suitable material 168 such as nylon velour or dacron mesh . alternatively , these portions of the inserts 163 can be provided with porous surfaces ( 50 - 150 microns pore size ) by the methods of this invention . conversely , it should be mentioned that gingival attachment in any of the other described examples can be obtained through the use of nylon velour or dacron mesh , if desired . after the implant has been in place for several weeks so that firm attachments have formed between the mandible and the large pore artificial ridge ( hard bone ingrowth ) and between the gingiva and the velour , mesh or small pore insert surface ( soft tissue ingrowth ), a one - piece group of solid plastic crowns 169 can be cemented onto the mounting posts . it will be appreciated , of course , that the crowns can be made of any other suitable conventional dental material and also that the artificial ridge can be made of any of the synthetic bone materials previously described . furthermore , the artificial ridge building technique can be used alone without insert teeth to provide support for a denture . instead of building up an artificial alveolar ridge to provide sufficient socket depth for proper support of implant teeth , the sockets themselves can be deepened by the procedure illustrated by fig1 through 17 and a prefabricated implant root installed as shown in fig1 . in fig1 , a natural tooth 170 is in an abnormally low alveolar socket 171 of a jawbone 172 having an alveolar canal 173 . according to the illustrated procecure , the tooth is extracted ( fig1 ), and a combination drill and tap 174 mounted in a slow speed handpiece 175 is inserted into the alveolar socket ( fig1 ), run down to the desired depth ( fig1 ), and then backed out leaving a deepened , threaded socket 176 ( fig1 ). a mating threaded plastic insert 177 ( fig1 ) having a suitable porous surface is then threaded into the socket . the insert has a suitable crown mounting post 178 for subsequent attachment of a hard plastic crown 179 ( shown in dashed lines ). since the threaded plastic insert is sized to match the drilled and tapped hole , it is possible to provide an assortment of preselected insert sizes , as shown in fig1 , to correspond to similar sized taps for a full range of tooth and alveolar site sizes . the threaded inserts will simplify the job of preparing a tooth implant in many cases when there is an existing tooth as well as in those situations where the tooth is missing . additional embodiments of threaded porous plastic inserts are shown in fig2 through 23 . in fig2 , a threaded insert 180 of porous plastic is shown in place in a jawbone 181 surmounted by dermis 182 and gingiva 183 . a solid plastic crown 184 is cemented onto mounting post 185 at the top of the insert . if desired , the mounting post portion of the insert can be made of integrally molded solid plastic instead of porous plastic . not only does this combination provide added strength but also the smooth surface of the solid plastic post will inhibit formation of epithelial attachment for the gingiva above the upper margin of the porous plastic cylindrical portions of the insert . features of this embodiment include a flared lip 186 at the top of the threaded portion that provides additional anchoring after the natural bone has grown in above it , as shown in fig2 . another feature is an axial center hole 187 ( best seen in fig2 and 22 ) that also produces improved anchorage by providing space for the ingrowth of hard bony cells and additional surface area for periodontal membrane attachment . fig2 a , b , and c illustrate a range of sizes for this type of implant in which the diameters vary inversely with length so that the surface area will remain approximately constant . thus , the different sizes are adapted for use in different regions of the jaw , but all provide similar anchoring surface . in the embodiment of fig2 through 26 , a tapered large pore porous plastic implant 188 having two transverse bone anchoring holes 189 and 190 is provided with a tapered threaded hole 191 for receiving a mating threaded hard plastic mounting post support 192 . insert 188 is set into alveolar bone 193 so that its top surface is slightly below the top of the alveolar ridge , thereby encouraging the natural bone to grow over the implant , firmly locking it in place . the threaded plastic insert is cemented in the threaded hole with its mounting post 196 extending above the gingiva to receive a crown 197 ( shown in dashed lines ) after the implant has become securely attached to the jawbone by hard bony ingrowth . alternatively , the implant can be made of small pore ( 50 - 150 micron ) porous plastic . in that case , it will become attached to the jawbone by means of a softer periodontal membrame , which provides a shock absorbing medium . in situations where there are no neighboring teeth to shield the mounting post during the period that the implant is becoming attached to the host bone , a temporary hard plastic or metal plug 198 having a top slot 199 can be screwed into the threaded hole , with its top surface flush with or below the surrounding gingiva 195 . after the implant is set , the plug is removed and the permanent insert screwed in and cemented in place . the porous plastic material used with the present invention is also suitable for making blade - type implants , and fig2 through 44 illustrate a number of different embodiments . in fig2 - 29 a wide - blade implant 200 of small pore plastic has an integrally cast solid plastic mounting post insert 201 . the implant site is prepared by cutting a thin slot in the jawbone 202 deep enough so that the top of the implant blade will be below the top of the alveolar ridge . dermis 203 and givgiva 204 are then sutured snugly against the tapered collar 205 to allow the gingiva to become attached to its porous surface . subsequently , a crown 206 ( shown in dashed lines ) can be cemented onto mounting post 207 . blade - type implant 200 has four bone ingrowth holes 208 and is particularly suited by shape and size for use in the rear of the lower jaw . smaller and narrower blade type implants 209 ( fig3 ) and 210 ( fig3 ) are suitable for bicuspid and incisor supports , respectively . in the upper jaw ( maxilla ), the presence of the maxillary sinus cavities create a problem in finding sufficient bone to support a tooth implant . this problem is solved by the curved - blade designs of fig3 - 34 , in which a blade - type implant 211 has a curved inner edge 212 to conform the the curve of a maxillary sinus cavity 213 . this type of implant can also come in a range of sizes as shown by implants 214 and 214b of fig3 a and 35b , respectively . still further implant shapes for crown mounting post supports are shown in fig3 through 44 . implant 215 ( fig3 - 38 ) has an arrowhead shape , implant 216 ( fig3 - 41 ) has a conical shape , and implant 217 ( fig4 - 44 ) has a fishtail shape . as mentioned earlier , the same porous plastic implant material used for tooth implants can also be used for bone implants , bone replacement , and joint prostheses . the primary difference is in pore size , since hard bony ingrowth requires pore sizes of at least 200 - 400 microns . referring to fig4 - 48 , there are shown various techniques for mandibular repair that are equally useful for bone repair in other parts of the body . in fig5 a porous plastic mandibular replacement section 218 is locked into mandible 219 by dovetails 220 and 221 . it will be appreciated that the dovetail joints are actually a relatively tight fit and additionally may be cemented in place for adequate fixation until bone ingrowth can occur . a larger mandibular segment 222 ( fig4 a and b ) is joined to the host hinge bone section 223 by a mortise and tenon 224 and 225 . as before , the joint can be cemented for stabilization until bone ingrowth takes place . in fig4 a bone insert 226 is held in place by acrylic screws 227 through acrylic plates 228 and also by cement , if desired . in fig4 plastic condylar heads 229 have been implanted at each hinge of mandible 230 . the polymethyl methacrylate material described herein is also useful for making hip joint or other joint prostheses . in fig4 , a prosthesis of conventional form has a hard , solid plastic head 231 , a small pore ( 50 - 150 microns ) plastic midbody 232 , and a large pore ( 200 - 400 microns ) plastic fixation pin 233 . the small pore midbody provides a surface for ligament attachment , and the large pore pin provides a surface for hard bony attachment when the pin is inserted in the end of a leg bone 234 , for example ( see fig5 ). an alternate joint prosthesis of conventional design is shown in fig5 with a smooth hard non - porous condylar head 235 , a small pore midbody 236 and a large pore fixation pin 237 having large bone ingrowth holes 238 . in fig5 a hard plastic ball 239 has a porous plastic cover 240 . it should be understood that in referring to porous plastic portions , whether small pore or large pore , the porosity can either extend all the way through the portion or be only in a surface layer , depending on the strength requirements of the implant or prosthesis . an important aspect of the present invention lies in the selection of proper pore size for the desired type of tissue attachment , whether soft connective tissue or hard bony tissue . since the desired attachment of the replica embodiments of fig1 - 9 is by relatively soft fibrous connective attachments 24 and 28 , the pore size of the sheath portion is preselected in the range from about 50 microns to about 150 microns , while the degree of porosity is preferably in the range from about 50 percent to about 75 percent by volume . in recent tests on rats conducted under the direction of the applicant , it has been discovered that the choice of pore size is critical in determining the type of cell ingrowth that will occur in porous polymethyl methacrylate ( hereinafter called porous pmm ) material . in these tests , two series of small samples of porous pmm having pore sizes predeominantly in the ranges 50 - 150 microns and 200 - 400 microns , respectively , were implanted in rats in four different site environments ; subcutaneous , intramuscular , intracerebral and intraosseous . the subcutaneous implants were retrived at intervals up to 70 days , but the implants in the other sites were kept in place a maximum of only 30 days . in each of the three non - osseus sites the surrounding tissues were firmly attached to the implants of both pore sizes , but there was no evidence of either cartilage development ( chondrogenesis ) or bone development ( osteogenesis ) at any of the nonosseous implant sites . at none of the sites was any infection or any other pathological symptom noted . at the intraosseous sites , on the other hand , there was found in all cases a reparative bone formation adjacent to the implanted specimens . within the pores of the materials , however , bone cells were found only in the large - pore ( 200 - 400 microns ) specimens . in the small - pore ( 50 - 150 microns ) specimens only soft tissue ingrowth was evident . these tests indicate , therefore , that the type of connection between bone and an intraosseous implant can be controlled by preselecting the pore size of the implant material in the regions of the implant surface that are contiguous to the host bone . referring again to the embodiment of fig1 - 9 , therefore , by preselection the surface pore size of the entire root portion of the implant to be in the range from about 50 microns to about 150 microns , the growth of soft connective tissue into both the upper root surfaces and the intraosseal root surfaces can be assured . the method of fabrication of the implant tooth replicas in each case is as follows : ( 2 ) the natural tooth is used , by well - known conventional dental laboratory techniques ( e . g . by flasking ) to form a replica mold ; ( 3 ) a conventional and well - known mold release agent is applied to the mold ; ( 4 ) a foundation for the porous portion of the replica root section is prepared by : ( a ) determining the desired porosity or porosity range , and degree of porosity . ( b ) selecting water soluble salt crystals having crystal sizes corresponding to the aforesaid pore sizes , ( c ) attaching a layer of said salt crystals to selected portions of said release agent coating on the inside of the mold , ( d ) mixing acrylic polymer and monomer with said salt composition in volume proportions corresponding to said desired degree of porosity to provide a molding composition of the required volume , ( 6 ) adding additional acrylic polymer and monomer to fill said mold , including said crown portion ; ( 7 ) heat polymerizing the ingredients in said mold , ( 8 ) extracting the casting from said mold ; ( 9 ) sandblasting or otherwise removing the surface skin from the root portion of the casting to expose the salt particles ; ( 10 ) boiling the casting in water for about four to fifteen minutes to leach out said salt to leave pores and voids in the place thereof ; and ( 11 ) pressing said porous casting into the extraction socket formerly occupied by the natural tooth . the salt crystals may be any water soluble salt . sodium chloride is preferred because of price and ease of removal , and especially because it is completely non - toxic and , in fact , residual amounts in the center portion of the root may benefit the healing process . on the other hand , any leachable crystaline material capable of more or less precise size classification may be used as long as it is non - toxic and has chemical compatibility with the plastic employed . the leaching medium may be other than water , likewise depending on its compatibility with the plastic and its non - toxicity . as examples of the type of pores and porosity that are obtained by the above described casting techniques , microphotographs of samples of polymethyl methacrylate materials made with three different sizes of salt crystals are shown in fig5 - 55 . fig5 is a so - called chlorine scan at approximately 3 × power of a sample of sodium chloride crystals having a size range of 100 - 150 microns . the photograph was made before leaching out the salt crystals , which show up as light spots on the dark background . fig5 shows a sample , after leaching , at 40 × power that was made with salt crystals having a size range of about 75 - 150 microns . fig5 shows a similar sample at 25 × power that was made with salt crystals in the size range of 300 - 400 microns . all samples were made with equal volumes of salt crystals and polymer . in view of polymethylmethacrylate &# 39 ; s proven adaptibility for implants it is recognized as preferred for the instant invention at the present time . recognizing , however , the rapid advance of scientific knowledge and expertise , it may well be a very short time that another , readily available , material may be used for the purposes of the present invention and perhaps even with greater advantage .",1
"referring to fig1 a diagram of the architecture of the cellular network assignment processor 10 in accordance with the present invention is shown . in the preferred embodiment , the cellular network assignment processor ( cap ) is adapted to solve constrained assignment problems , such as deghosting for angle - only information from three sensors . the cap processor 10 contains an array of processing cells 12 . each of the processing cells 12 is located at a particular address , and contains a cost register which stores the cost value of the assignment problem . information may be transmitted to and from the cells 12 through address lines 14 . each cell is also capable of comparing its own cost value with other cells to which it is connected to determine if it is a minimum or a maximum of the connected cost values . in addition , the cells 12 may contain a refractory period register which stores a given refractory period and counts down when that period is set for a given period of time . also , the cells 12 contain a solution - flag register which signifies that the cell 12 is chosen for a correct solution . it will be appreciated that implementation of these functions in each cell 12 can be performed with electrical circuitry comprising about 200 gates . an interconnect register 16 is connected to the address lines 14 and also is used to determine which of these cells 12 have identified themselves as being a minimum or a maximum . the interconnect register 16 implements the actual interconnection between the cells . also a cap control unit 20 instructs the cells to perform their various functions as will be described below . to begin the processing , a host cpu 22 and an interface unit 24 receive the cost information in the assignment problem and transmit this information to the cap control unit 20 , which in turn transmits the appropriate cost value to the corresponding cell 12 . in deghosting angle - only information from 3 sensors , there will be a three dimensional cube of cells . in fig1 the cells 12 are shown in two dimensions to simplify the drawing . it will be appreciated that the three address lines 14 connecting each cell permit a three dimensional cube of cells to be represented . rows of cells on a first , or x - axis in a first plane in the cube will correspond to all possible sensor angles for a first sensor . cell locations on the y - axis , perpendicular to the x - axis , correspond to all the possible sensor angles for a second sensor . likewise , locations for the z - axis , perpendicular to both the x and y - axis , represent all possible sensor angles for a third sensor . thus , a cell location or address may be defined by a coordinate system in which each coordinate represents a particular input parameter . referring now to fig2 the information to be stored in each cell 12 , represents triple intersects of three sensors . that is , when a sensor 26 detects a target 28 , a line is plotted from the sensor 26 location to the target 28 location . every point where the lines from the 3 sensors 26 all intersect is called a triple intersect . note , however , that some of these intersects represent real targets 28 and thus are valid , while some are &# 34 ; accidental &# 34 ; triple intersects and are invalid or &# 34 ; ghosts &# 34 ; 30 . the assignment problem is to eliminate the ghosts 30 or deghost the data , so that only actual targets 28 are detected . as will be appreciated , the host cpu 22 in fig1 can be connected to the sensors 26 and can detect the triple intersects and transmit the angular data from each sensor 26 that corresponds to each triple intersect . in addition , the host cpu 22 will also calculate the area of the triangles found in each triple intersect . this triangle 32 is formed because of measurement errors in the sensor data . even for valid targets , the triple intersect will not be point but will be instead a small triangular area formed by the three lines . the host cpu 22 will call a triple intersect those intersects , having a triangle with an area below a given criteria . the host cpu 22 will then transmit the digital data representing this area for each triple intersect to the cell 12 associated with those three angles for the three sensors . it is the area of this error triangle 32 that is the &# 34 ; cost &# 34 ; in the assignment problem . the cap processor 10 minimizes total cost by minimizing the area of the triangles 32 in a given solution . since triangles 32 corresponding to ghosts 30 will tend to be larger than those corresponding to real targets 28 , the cap processor 10 eliminates ghosts 30 by choosing solutions having smaller triangles 32 . the assumption that real targets 28 will have smaller triangles 32 than ghosts 30 is generally valid for problems having up to about 50 targets . as the density increases , with greater targets , the number of ghosts 30 becomes extremely large . for example , there may be tens of thousands of ghosts . at this point , the probability is increased that some ghosts may have smaller triangles than targets and performance could begin to degrade . in summary , the host cpu 22 receives the angular data from the sensors 26 , determines where triple intersects occur , and sends the area of the error triangle 32 of the triple intersect to the cell 12 associated with that set of angles from the three sensors . the cells 12 then , by their location or coordinates in the cap processor 10 , represent a mapping of a set of three sensor 26 angles , and each cell 12 stores the area of the error triangle 32 for that particular intersect . referring now to fig3 a , 3b and 3c , there is shown a flow chart of the steps performed by the cap processor 10 in finding an optimal solution to an assignment problem . it should be noted that costs may be defined so that the goal of the processing is to maximize or minimize cost . in the following discussions , the goal of the processing will be to maximize total cost . in the first step ( step 34 ), the host computer 22 is given a number of input parameters including the number of the row , or start row that is to initialize the process . it should be noted that each row in each of the three dimensions in the cube of cells 12 correspond to a particular angle for a particular sensor 26 . the total number of rows for each sensor 26 corresponds to the total number of real targets 28 . the host cpu 22 counts the number of rows in the current problem . also an arbitrary number of cycles is fed to the host cpu 22 . then , the cost data is fed into each cell 12 by the host cpu so that the cost data is located at a cell 12 at an address which corresponds to the location of that cost in the assignment space of the assignment problem . for example , in the 3 sensor deghosting problem the cost will comprise the area of an error triangle 32 for a particular triple intersect , and will be located at an address which represents the angle of a sensor 26 for that triple intersect . cells which are stored with costs are then interconnected by the interconnect register 16 , as follows . a cell are connected to all other cells 12 to which it has any potential conflicts . thus , the cell representing the triple intersect at address ( a , b , c ) will be connected to all other cells containing cost data having addresses of either ( a , x , x ), ( x , b , x ) or ( x , x , c ). as a result , if any single row contains two or more triple intersects , the group cells representing those intersects will be connected to each other by the interconnect register 16 . in other words , groups of cells 12 in particular rows are connected to other cells with they are in conflict . only one of the cells 12 in a particular row represents a true target 28 and the others represent ghosts 30 . next , the maximum cost in each row is determined . ( step 36 ) this may be the only cost in a particular row or it may be the maximum of whatever number of costs are in the particular row . where there are more than one cost in a row , only one is a valid target and the rest are ghosts . also , in this step ( step 36 ) a solution flag is set for the maximum cost . it should be noted , however , that some other way of assigning the initial flags , could be used , such as a random assignment of one cost per row . this is merely an initializing , or a first proposed solution , to create a starting point from which the cap processor 10 will move toward better and better solutions . a row counter and a cycle counter are also set to zero . these counters exist in software within the cap controller 20 . in the next step , ( step 38 ) the cap controller 10 finds the row that was defined as the start row in ( step 34 ). the cell in that start row whose flag is set is then located ( step 40 ). this is currently the chosen cell . the cap controller 20 next compares the chosen cell to all cells 12 that are connected to it ( step 42 ). the cap controller 20 next determines if there is a conflict between the associated location address ( ala ) of the selected cell and the ala of any cells 12 connected to it and whose flag is set ( step 44 ). by virtue of being connected , connected cells 12 have at least one of the three rows the same as the chosen cells , so they are in conflict . step 44 looks to see if any of the connected cells have a flag that is set . since the cells with flags represent potential solutions , the question is , are there any conflicts in this proposed solution . when a conflict is found in step 44 the row counter in the cap controller 20 is reset to zero . ( step 46 ), and the cycle counter is incremented by one . ( step 48 ) the cap controller 20 then determines if the maximum number of cycles has been reached . ( step 50 ) if it has , the invalid done flag is set and the ala of the chosen cell is transmitted to the host cpu 22 . ( step 52 ) if instead the maximum number of cycles has not been reached as determined in step 50 , the chosen cell will instead find the minimum cost value of those connected cells whose flags are set and not in the current row . ( step 54 ) the cap controller 20 will next look at the row containing the minimum cost value cell ( mcv ) found in step 54 . this row is now the new current row . ( step 56 ) next , every cell &# 39 ; s refractory period is decremented . ( step 58 ) the purpose of the refractory period is to avoid going back to the previous solution . this allows other solutions an opportunity to participate and thereby avoids oscillation . the refractory mechanism disables a particular solution for a period of time . next , the flag of the minimum cost value cell ( mcv ) which had a conflict is reset . ( step 60 ) resetting disconnects the cell . the refractory period then begins . ( step 60 ) the cap controller 20 then looks within the row for a refractory period which is equal to zero . ( step 62 ) if there are none , the refractory period of all cells in current row are decremented , ( step 64 ) and step 62 is repeated until there is a refractory period that is equal to zero . the maximum cost value in that row whose refractory period is zero is then selected , ( step 66 ) and the solution flag of that cell is set . ( step 68 ) this now becomes the chosen cell . the processor then proceeds back to step 42 and the connected cells are compared to the new chosen cell to determine if there are any conflicts with that cell . ( step 42 ) if there are still conflicts steps 44 - 68 are repeated . if there are no conflicts , the cap processor 10 proceeds to step 70 where the row counter is incremented by 1 . ( step 70 ) the row counter is then tested to see if the row counter has reached its maximum . ( step 72 ) if it has , then the cap processor 10 will have operated on all rows and a valid cell will have been found for each row . then the solution flag is set and the ala of the chosen cell is transmitted to the host cpu 22 as a valid solution ( step 74 ). if instead the row counter has not reached its maximum , then the cap processor 10 proceeds to the next row ( step 76 ), and steps 40 - 72 are repeated for the next row . in summary , once the cap processor 10 has operated on each row a potential solution will have been found . if the done flag has been set for a cell in each row and the ala of those cells are all independent ( none in conflict with one another ), a valid solution will have been found , and will be given to the host cpu . at this point the host cpu 22 can stop the process and the solution found may be obtained . alternatively , the host cpu 22 may instruct the cap controller 20 to initiate the process again . due to the randomness of refractory periods the cap controller 10 could converge to a different solution the next time . thus the host cpu 22 may keep a running history of the best solutions and only the best solution may be utilized . in addition , the host cpu 22 may contain an interrupt function which permits the current solution to be accessed at any particular time . this interrupt feature is often a requirement for real - time systems where the time the processor is given to arrive at a solution may vary . the complexity of the problem to be solved will determine the number of times the number of final solutions to be found . it should be noted that beyond solving the deghosting problem for angle - only data from three sensors , the present invention may be adapted to solve other assignment problems such as the traveling salesman problem , optimal plot - to - track correlation processing , optimal weapons allocation , computarized tonography and others . it will be appreciated that the basic components of the cap processor 10 may be implemented with conventional electrical circuits such as programmable logic devices . also , optical devices may be used for some of the functions . from the foregoing description it can be appreciated that the present invention provides a cellular network assignment processor 10 capable of solving assignment problems in real - time , at speeds of 3 - 4 orders - of - magnitude faster than conventional solutions . those skilled in the art can appreciate that other advantages can be obtained from the use of this invention and that modification can be made without departing from the true spirit of the invention after studying the specification , drawings and following claims .",6

and - roll table gas cylinder . such cylinders can range from 95 - 220 lbs of compression rating . therefore , the instant tool is adapted to compress a gas cylinder 2 and maintain the gas cylinder 2 in a fixed position while the entire implement with the gas cylinder 2 is located at the desired position such that the gas cylinder 2 can replace an already mounted , pre - existing cylinder efficiently and safely . clamp subassembly 1 is generally c - shaped to include an elongate arm 3 , an upper jaw 4 , and a lower jaw 5 . “ generally ” c - shaped means the upper jaw 4 and lower jaw 5 extend from the arm 3 as would be typical for a c - clamp device , but the arm 3 need not be linear nor do each jaw have to be linear and perpendicular to arm 3 , although preferred . a handle 6 can be disposed at any location along arm 3 or upper jaw 4 to aid in maneuvering the clamp subassembly 1 . the desired type of handle 6 as shown is a lock - tight type handle 6 which raises or lowers the upper jaw 4 and upon lowering “ locks ” the upper jaw 4 in its down - most position . upper jaw 4 extends from upper end 7 of arm 3 . a spindle 8 is configured to move vertically through upper jaw 4 and is disposed through upper jaw 4 as shown , the spindle lower end 9 of spindle 8 configured to engage one end of the gas cylinder 2 . for example , the spindle 8 is threadedly connected through a hole defined in upper end 7 such that upon manually rotation of the spindle 8 the spindle 8 travels up or down and thus “ axially ” in relation to arm 3 through the hole as would be understood . lower jaw 5 is disposed along arm 3 distal to upper jaw 4 , extending therefrom similarly to upper jaw 4 with its length of extension substantially similar to the length of upper jaw 4 so as to have its lower jaw 5 outer end 10 substantially aligned with spindle 8 of upper jaw 4 . lower jaw 4 may include an adjustment means for sliding lower jaw 5 up and down ( axially ) along arm 3 , thus being movably positioned along arm 3 to vary the length between spindle lower end 9 and the lower jaw outer end 10 in large increments . accordingly , gas cylinder 2 can be placed within and movably fixed between upper jaw 4 and lower jaw 5 as shown . the tower jaw 5 , described in more detail , includes a lower channel member 11 disposed at lower jaw outer end 10 . lower channel member 11 is mounted to lower jaw outer end 10 in one embodiment using a screw such that lower channel number 11 can be raised or lowered slightly in small increments . further shown is how lower channel member is sized to have accommodated therein one eye receptacle of the gas cylinder 2 . in the preferred embodiment the lower channel is u - shaped such that its extended portions can engage the eyelet in a cup - like fashion . however , it is not critical that lower u - channel be precisely “ u ” shaped as shown in the preferred embodiment . however , it is critical that it not be flat , thus of a shape which provides for any means to forcibly abut the eye receptacle while enveloping the eyelet in some manner , such as a curved plate or cup - like member , which additionally may be case - hardened in any fashion . the upper jaw 4 , described in more detail , includes a similar upper channel member 13 disposed at spindle lower end 9 . spindle 8 is formed as an elongate bolt or any type of threaded , cylindrical pin adapted to travel through upper jaw outer end 10 . upper channel member therefore travels with spindle lower end 10 . in a preferred embodiment both the upper and lower channel members 11 , 13 are attached to their respective locations loosely or with a free spin attachment so that bolt can be tightened or loosened for fine adjustments or moved to match the angle of each cylinder eyelet rather than move the eyelet 2 a itself to align with a static u - channel . in either embodiment , shown is how upper channel member 13 is sized ( similarly to lower channel member 11 ) to have accommodated therein the opposing eye receptacle or eyelet 2 a of the gas cylinder 2 to thereby confine the gas cylinder 2 . as with the lower channel member 11 , it is not critical that upper channel member 13 be precisely u - shaped as shown in the preferred embodiment . however , it is critical that it not be flat , thus of a shape which provides for any means to forcibly abut the eyelet 2 a while enveloping the eyelet 2 a in some manner , such as a curved plate or cup - like member , which additionally may be case - hardened in any fashion . fig6 shows an embodiment wherein a leveraging extension bar 19 can be utilized with the handle 6 for increasing leverage . now referencing fig5 , shown next to clamp subassembly 1 is housing 16 . housing 16 is a means for immobilizing the cylinder 2 as it is clamped by clamp subassembly 1 . defined on housing 16 is housing channel 17 , for instance two raised , generally parallel guides 18 a , 18 b up - stand from a base , i . e . along a length of the housing 16 . the gas cylinder 2 is placed within the housing channel 17 . the guides 18 a , 18 b therefore maintain the cylinder 2 in a relatively stationary position . in this manner , the clamp subassembly 1 can be more easily and accurately secured to each eye receptacle or eyelet 2 a of the cylinder 2 , which expectedly could roll around and move about a flat surface if merely placed thereon . in use and with particular reference to fig4 , described herein is a method for replacing a gas cylinder 2 at an underside of a table 14 , summarized by the steps of : measuring a length of an installed gas cylinder ; removing the installed gas cylinder ; setting a clamp 1 on a new gas cylinder 2 , wherein the clamp 1 is set to approximately the length of the installed gas cylinder obtained from the step of measuring ; moving the clamp 1 with the new gas cylinder 2 engaged thereto to the underside of the table 14 ; while still engaged to the clamp 1 , bolting the new gas cylinder 2 to the underside of the table 14 ; and , releasing the clamp 1 from the new gas cylinder 2 , as a result leaving the new gas cylinder 2 at the underside of the table 14 . more particularly , the fold - and - roll table 14 is positioned such that the underside is slightly upright or otherwise made accessible , revealing the old , in - place cylinder , i . e . the “ installed ” gas cylinder . the length of the installed cylinder is measured in - situ , in its compressed position , for example the length between the bolted - in eyelet 2 a receptacles which are mounted to the table &# 39 ; s mounting holes . the old cylinder is removed . the clamp subassembly 1 with its handle 6 in a downward position is set with its u - channels ( channel members 11 , 13 ) spanning a distance which approximates the measurement . the clamp &# 39 ; s handle 6 is then released to unlock the clamp 1 . the new cylinder 2 to replace the old cylinder is placed on a flat surface , preferably within housing 16 . the clamp subassembly 1 with its handle 6 in an up position is placed over the new cylinder 2 and engages the new cylinder 2 by way of the handle 6 of the clamp 1 being pushed downward to “ lock ” the cylinder 2 between the u - channels 11 , 13 . the handle 6 of clamp 1 pushing down therefore forcibly compresses the cylinder 2 to the same measurement as previously noted for the old cylinder . the clamp 1 with the compressed cylinder 2 therein is then taken to the installation location and still while within the clamp the eyelets 2 a of the new cylinder 2 are aligned with the same mounting holes of the table &# 39 ; s underside . the length of the new cylinder 2 can be finely adjusted using the adjustment bolts if need be . the cylinder 2 is then fastened using bolts through the eyelets 2 a , and the clamp 1 is released , leaving the newly mounted , replacement cylinder 2 , replaced without having to jostle and maneuver the entire table 14 , without requiring two individuals , and without having to compress or maneuver the new cylinder 2 at the confined and potentially dangerous mounting location underneath the table 14 .",1
"the cleaning arrangement which is illustrated in fig1 - 6 comprises a cleaning nozzle 1 , which is fixedly arranged in the end of a flexible hose 2 for feeding compressed air to the nozzle . the hose 2 is fastened on the cleaning nozzle 1 by means of a hose clamp 3 . the parts are shown disassembled in fig2 . in fig1 the cleaning arrangement is shown inserted in a pipe - shaped duct where dust and deposits are to be removed from walls of the duct . the cleaning nozzle 1 includes a rear piece 3 and a front piece 4 dismantleable from this . the rear piece 3 is provided with a coupling pipe 3 . 1 to which the hose is secured by means of a hose clamp 5 . the coupling pipe 3 . 1 can constitute an integrated portion of the rear piece 3 , such as is shown for example in fig2 and 4 , or it can be secured with a suitable pin 3 . 2 such as is shown in fig3 . the rear piece 3 exhibits four distribution holes 3 . 3 which are arranged symmetrically about its central axis , something which for one thing is evident from fig6 and the holes 3 . 3 are connected to the coupling pipe 3 . 1 and discharge into the forward end of the rear piece directed towards the front piece 4 . the front piece 4 , which largely has the shape of a hemisphere , shows a mixing chamber 4 . 1 which extends symmetrically about its central axis and which has the same radius which the distribution holes 3 . 3 are arranged with around the axis . the function of the mixing chamber 4 . 1 will be described further below . the rear piece 3 furthermore presents an external conical surface 3 . 4 , which extends along its periphery at its front end , and which corresponds to an internal conical surface 4 . 2 on the front piece , the assembled cleaning nozzle 1 exhibiting an annular gap 6 along the periphery of the nozzle which is directed back out towards the coupling piece 3 . 1 . the width of the annular gap 6 can be regulated by means of a washer 7 the thickness of which determines the width of the gap so that a thicker washer 7 gives a wider annular gap 6 . the front piece 4 is fixedly mounted on the rear piece 3 by means of a screw 8 which passes through a central hole 4 . 3 in the front piece 4 and , is screwed into a threaded hole 3 . 5 in the rear piece 3 . an alternative design of a cleaning nozzle 11 , which is shown in fig7 - 10 , includes a rear piece 13 and a front piece 14 rotatable mounted on the rear part 13 . the rear piece 13 is provided with a coupling pipe 13 . 1 for the hose on which the cleaning nozzle 11 is to be arranged and showing four symmetrically around its central axis arranged distribution holes 13 . 3 , arranged as in the design described above . the front piece 14 shows a mixing chamber 14 . 1 as in the design described above . the rear piece 13 and the front piece 14 also show corresponding conical surfaces 13 . 4 , 14 . 2 which assembled make the cleaning nozzle exhibiting an annular gap 16 along the periphery of the nozzle which is directed backwards . as in the design described above the width of the annular gap 16 can be regulated by means of a washer 17 . the front piece 14 is rotatable mounted on the rear piece 13 by means of a screw 18 which close to its head shows a cylindrical portion 18 . 1 in the shape of a spindle around which the front piece can rotate . the portion 18 . 1 has a larger diameter and the corresponding hole in the washer 17 and a length permitting a rotation without play which makes the screw 18 to be driven to the rear piece 13 and the washer 17 completely at mounting . the front piece 14 also shows two diametrically , mainly tangentially to an inner circle directed outlet openings 14 . 3 extending in a plane on each side of a diameter plane through the central axis of the cleaning nozzle to in an angle of 5 °- 10 ° to this plane . each outlet opening 14 . 3 is connected to the mixing chamber 14 . 1 by bores 14 . 4 . by forces of reaction from the air exiting from the outlet openings 14 . 3 the front piece 14 is imparted a rotation relative to the rear piece 13 . a friction ring 19 of rubber is arranged in a groove along the periphery of the front piece 14 by means of which the rotation of the front piece 14 can be transmitted to a movement of the complete cleaning nozzle 11 along the inner wall of a duct in an alternative design the outlet openings 14 . 3 and the bores 14 . 4 are replaced by inner open grooves 14 . 5 shown in fig1 , in which the front piece 14 is seen in a direction to its front end . the grooves 14 . 5 extend in the conical surface 14 . 2 at the inner end of the front piece 14 a distance into the mixing chamber 14 . 1 in the front piece 14 and is located in a plane on each side of a diametrical plane through the central axis of the cleaning nozzle in an angle of 5 °- 10 ° to this plane . a part of the front piece 14 in a longitudinal section is shown in fig1 . preferably 6 - 8 grooves are uniformly distributed around the periphery of the front piece 14 . during cleaning of a pipe - shaped ventilation duct , such as is shown in fig1 an exhaust valve for example is replaced with a coupling arrangement 20 as is illustrated in fig1 and 13 . the coupling arrangement 20 presents a flange 21 sealed against a wall and a bent pipe 22 projecting outwardly from the flange to which there is coupled a suction hose which connects the bent pipe to a vacuum cleaner arrangement or the like . the bent pipe 22 shows an insert opening 24 situated in the extension of the centre line to the horizontal portion of the bent pipe 22 in fig1 and 12 , and through the opening is inserted the cleaning nozzle 1 , 11 with the hose 2 . the cleaning operation consists in that the cleaning nozzle 1 , 11 after the insertion in the ventilation duct which is to be cleaned , is fed with compressed air which if desired is fed with a cleaning agent and / or a disinfectant . at high speed compressed air consequently discharges back out from the annular gap along the periphery of the cleaning nozzle 1 , so that the nozzle is driven into the duct as a result of the forces of reaction from the discharging air , and carries the hose 2 with it . simultaneously the suction hose 23 is placed under reduced pressure so that dust which is released from inner walls of the duct is sucked away from the duct and is collected in the vacuum cleaner arrangement which moreover is not shown in the figures . when the cleaning nozzle 1 is brought into the duct it is caused to contact the inner walls of the duct by an action of ejection . by twisting the hose 2 sideways the cleaning nozzle 1 according to the first design mentioned is caused to move sideways in the duct on the same time as it is caused to move ahead in the duct by its own force or eventually also backwards in the duct by pulling the hose . at the use of the cleaning nozzle 1 first scribed above dust and existing deposits are released from inner walls of the duct partly as a result of the cutting effect which is produced by the air discharging from the annular gap 6 , and partly as a result of irregular movements of the cleaning nozzle 1 and impacts against inner walls of the duct . at using the cleaning nozzle 11 in the alternative design the front piece 14 of the cleaning nozzle 11 also is caused to rotate , which movement is transferred into a movement of the entire cleaning nozzle 11 along the walls of the duct . another alternative design of a cleaning nozzle 31 , shown in fig1 - 17 , comprises a rear piece 33 , on which a rotateable front piece 34 is mounted , and an annular gap 36 therebetween . the rear piece 33 is provided with a coupling pipe 33 . 1 for a hose 32 on which the nozzle 31 is proposed to be arranged . this nozzle 31 snows mainly the same design features for the rest as the next above described nozzle . the front piece 34 also shows inner open grooves 34 . 5 extending in an angle to the radial through each groove as in the next above described alternative . however the front piece 34 is arranged rotatably on a shaft 35 by help of two radial ball bearings 38 . 1 and one axial ball bearing 38 . 2 . in order to gain the ejection effect , which is present just at the annular gap 36 , the front piece 34 is provided with an ejector ring 37 running along the annular gap 36 and kept in a distance from the front piece 34 by means of distance means 37 . 1 . the ejector ring 37 and the distance means 37 . 1 can be made in one piece e . g . made of hard rubber , since the ejector ring 37 has the same effect as the friction ring which was mentioned above . the ejector ring 37 also can be made as two concentric rings with distance means them between which facilitates its mounting on the front piece 34 . alternatively the distance means can constitute an integrated portion of the front piece 34 , since the ejector ring can be made completely smooth . a cross section of the ejector ring 37 is shown in fig1 from which it is clear that the outer circumscribed surface 37 . 2 of the ejector ring 37 has an oval profile and its inner surface 37 . 3 has a straight profile . air which is caused to pass the outer surface 37 . 2 of the ejector ring 37 by this is given a higher speed and a lower pressure than the air which is caused to pass through the ejector ring 37 at its inner surface 37 . 3 . when the cleaning nozzle 34 is brought into contact with a wall in a duct this makes that the pressure of the air between the nozzle and the duct wall is lowered further making the cleaning nozzle 34 to contact the duct wall with an increased force compared with the designs described above . the contact of the cleaning nozzle 34 to the wall of the duct is gained more if the nozzle is brought in an angle to the wall . this will be achieved simply by designing the front piece 34 mainly conically tapered from the annular gap 36 to its nose causing the annular gap 36 to remain in the vicinity of the wall . by the projecting ejector ring 37 the desired inclination will be more ensured . an another alternative design of the cleaning nozzle 41 as shown in fig1 - 20 comprises a rear piece 43 on which a rotatable front piece 44 is mounted . the rear piece 43 is connected to a hose 42 . the ejector ring according to the design described above is replaced by a number of grooves 45 extending along the periphery of the front piece 44 in the longitudinal direction of the cleaning nozzle 41 . air which is caused to flow between the inner wall of the duct and the cleaning nozzle is controlled by the grooves 45 in a way which improves the contact of the cleaning nozzle to the wall of the duct . in the figures the grooves 45 are shown extending in a distance from the rear edge of the front piece 44 and forward in a conical portion 44 . 1 directed forward on the front piece . the extension of the grooves 45 in the conical portion 44 . 1 can be varied and also extend along all of this portion . the conical portion 4 . 1 shows a cone angle of a = 15 °, but it can be between 10 °- 40 °. if , as shown in the example , the conical surfaces which lead forwards to the annular gap 6 incline with a gap angle b = 50 ° the air discharging from the annular gap will be directed with an impact angle of 35 ° towards the ceiling surface . the gap angle b can be 30 °- 60 ° by which the impact angle can vary within the region 5 °- 40 °, preferably 10 °- 20 °, by selection of the cone angle a and / or the gap angle b . in order to gain the effect of cleaning nozzles with rotating front pieces more these can be provided with a brush , preferably arranged along the periphery of each front piece , e . g . on the outer side of the ejector ring described above or just at the grooves in the front piece in the alternative design . it is also possible to arrange a circular brush at the nose of the rotating front piece . in order to gain the contact of the cleaning nozzle to the inner wall of a pipe line of a magnetic material , which is most common as pipe lines as a rule are made of galvanized steel sheet , magnets , especially permanent magnets , can be arranged along the periphery of the cleaning nozzle . in that way e . g . the ejector ring described above can show magnet members along its periphery or the rotating nozzle can have such magnets arranged on the , relative to the hose , fixed rear piece or the rotating front piece .",1
