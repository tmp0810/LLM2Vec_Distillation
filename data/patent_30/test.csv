"as used herein , the term &# 34 ; sensitizer moiety &# 34 ; means a moiety containing at least one group that is not a part of the triazine chromophore and is capable of absorbing actinic radiation and enhancing spectral sensitivity . halomethyl substituted , 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine compounds of this invention can be represented by the general formula i : ## str1 ## wherein a represent a member selected from the group consisting of mono -, di - and trihalo methyl groups , y represent a member selected from the group consisting of a , l - s , nh 2 , nhr , nr 2 , or , and r &# 39 ;, where r independently represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group , preferably having 1 to 6 carbon atoms , or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group , and r &# 39 ; represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group , preferably having 1 to 6 carbon atoms , a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group , a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl group , preferably having 2 to 6 carbon atoms , or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic aromatic group , s represents a sensitizer moiety that is not part of the triazine chromophore and is capable of absorbing actinic radiation , s having a λmax of at least 330 nm , and l represents a group linking the sensitizer moiety to the triazine nucleus . halomethyl groups that are suitable for the present invention include chloro -, bromo -, and iodomethyl groups , with chloro - and bromomethyl groups being preferred . trihalomethyl groups are preferred ; most preferred are trichloromethyl and tribromomethyl groups . y represents any of a variety of substituents that are useful in modifying the physical , e . g ., solubility , or chemical properties of the molecule , and preferably represents a , l - s , or r &# 39 ;. when y represents a , the maximum number of halomethyl groups per triazine nucleus can be made available for radical generation . when y represents l - s , the chemical composition for both l - s groups can be the same , or it can be different , depending on the composition of linking group l , sensitizer group s , or both . when y represents r &# 39 ;, and in particular when r &# 39 ; represents an aryl , aralkenyl , or heteroaromatic group , the spectral sensitivity of the triazine chromophore portion of the molecule can be varied , based on the photochemical response of r , to actinic radiation . when r or r &# 39 ; represents an aryl group it is preferred that the group have a maximum of five rings , more preferably three rings , and most preferably one ring . when r or r &# 39 ; represents a substituted group , the particular identity of the substituent is not critical . however , the substituents should not adversely affect the photoinitiation characteristics of the compounds of this invention . s represents a sensitizer - containing group which , by itself , would not initiate photopolymerization upon exposure to actinic energy , but is nevertheless capable of absorbing actinic radiation , and transferring energy to the halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine moiety , thereby effectively increasing the spectral sensitivity of the halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine moiety . the sensitizer moiety has a λmax ( i . e ., absorption maximum ) of at least 330 nm , preferably 350 nm up to 900 nm . s preferably comprises at least one member selected from the group consisting of cyanine group , carbocyanine group , merocyanine group , aromatic hydrocarbon group , polyarylamine group , and amino - substituted chalcone group . there is no upper limit on the number of sensitizer moieties per triazine nucleus ; there is no upper limit on the number of triazine nuclei per sensitizer moiety ; however , there must be at least one sensitizer moiety and at least one triazine nucleus . preferably , the number of sensitizer moieties per triazine nucleus ranges from one to two or two to one ; more preferably , there is one sensitizer moiety per triazine nucleus . if more than one sensitizer moiety is present per triazine nucleus , they can be from different generic classes or can be different species from the same generic class . if there is more than one triazine nucleus per sensitizer moiety , they can be of the same or of different species . l represents a group that links the sensitizer moiety or moieties to the triazine nucleus . the precise identity of l is not critical , but it should be selected so that it does not interfere with or adversely affect the light sensitivity of the compound . furthermore , l should be chosen so that it does not connect the chromophore of the halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine nucleus and the chromophore of the sensitizer moiety either directly by a covalent bond or by a conjugated linkage . however , any through space intramolecular complexation between the chromophores is not precluded . l can be a single group or can be formed from a combination of groups . groups that are suitable for linking groups include carbamator (-- nhco 2 --), urea (-- nhconh --), amino (-- nh --), amido (-- conh 2 --), aliphatic e . g ., having up to 10 carbon atoms , alkyl , e . g ., having up to 10 carbon atoms , alkenyl , e . g ., having up to 10 carbon atoms , aryl , e . g ., having one ring , styryl , ester (-- co 2 --), ether (-- o --), and combinations thereof . based on ease of synthesis , the most preferred groups for attachment directly to the triazine nucleus are carbamato , urea , amino , alkenyl , aryl , and ether . whenever the group directly attached to the triazine nucleus is either alkenyl group or aryl group , another group must be interposed between the alkenyl group or aryl group and the sensitizer moiety to prevent the sensitizer moiety from forming a conjugate bond with the triazine nucleus . one method of preparing the compounds of this invention is by the addition reaction of isocyanato - substituted halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazines with sensitizers having groups reactive with the isocyanate group . the isocyanato substituted triazines may be prepared from the corresponding amino derivative according to the procedure of u . von gizycki , angew , chem . int . ed . eng ., 1971 , 10 , 403 . isocyanato - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazines suitable for this reaction include : examples of sensitizers that will combine with the isocyanto group include 4 -( 2 &# 39 ;- hydroxyethyl ) amino - n - 2 &# 34 ;- hydroxyethyl )- 1 , 8 - naphthalimide , 3 , 5 - bis ( dimethylaminobenzal )- 4 - piperidone , hydroxyethylrhodanine - n &# 34 ;- methylbenzothiazole , 1 - aminopyrene , and 6 - aminochrysene . the isocyanate addition reaction can be carried out in the presence of solvents , such as , for example , toluene , pyridine , benzene , xylene , dioxane , tetrahydrofuran , etc ., and mixtures of solvents . the duration and temperature of the reaction is dependent on the particular compounds and the catalyst employed . generally , temperatures of about 25 ° to 150 ° for from one to seventy - two hours are sufficient to provide for the reaction . preferably , the reaction is carried out at room temperature from three to seventy - two hours . the preferred catalyst is di - n - butyltin dilaurate . another method of preparing the compounds of this invention is the cotrimerization of organic nitriles having a sensitizer substituent with haloacetonitriles in accordance with the teachings of wakabayashi et al , bulletin of the chemical society of japan , 1969 , 42 , 2924 - 30 ; still another method of preparing the compounds of this invention is the condensation reaction of an aldehyde compound having a photoinitiator functionality in accordance with the teachings of u . s pat . no . 3 , 987 , 037 ; still another method of preparing the compound of this invention is the nucleophilic displacement reactions on halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazines using sensitizers having free hydroxy or amino groups . the natural sensitivity of halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazines to actinic radiation is well known . simple derivatives , such as 2 - methyl - 4 , 6 - bistrichloromethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine , absorb actinic radiation in the lower ultraviolet region , e . g . below 300 nm . photosensitizers have been added to compositions containing halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazines as separate materials to , in effect , broaden their natural range of sensitivity . this phenomenon is complex , and is believed to involve various types of energy transfer mechanisms from the excited states of the sensitizer . moreover , the efficiency of physical combinations of sensitizing dye and photoinitiator is limited due to concentration , solubility , and light filtration factors . the compounds of this invention in which the sensitizer moiety and the halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine moiety are in the same molecule are more efficient for several reasons . they eliminate the need to add each material separately . they assure that the sensitizer moiety is very close to the triazine nucleus , thereby allowing lower concentrations and increased energy transfer efficiency . a halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine compound having a chromophore substituted directly to the triazine nucleus has a broader sensitivity range than the unsubstituted halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine compound . see , for example , u . s . pat . no . 3 , 954 , 475 , u . s . pat . no . 4 , 189 , 323 , u . s . pat . no . 4 , 391 , 687 , and de 3517440 . however , the nature of the compounds in these patents is limited in that preparation thereof requires formation of a covalent bond or a conjugated linkage between the triazine nucleus and the chromophore substituent , typically by either an aryl group or a vinyl group . because the triazine nucleus is not insulated from the chromophore substituent , it is difficult to predict , a priori , the absorption characteristics , i . e ., absorption maxima , of the resulting chromophore - triazine combination because they will differ from those of both the chromophore and the triazine . the compounds of this invention provide a wide variety of structures in that dye and triazine precursors can be prepared independently and then synthetically combined by simple reactions and without having to form a conjugated linkage . also , the spectral sensitivity can be predicted , a priori , to correspond to the spectral sensitivity of the sensitizer moiety . by utilizing a sensitizer moiety having a λmax ( i . e ., absorption maximum ) of at least 330 nm , the range of sensitivity of a halomethyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine compound can be broadened . photopolymerizable compositions wherein the compounds of this invention can be used typically comprise ( 1 ) an unsaturated , free radical initiated , chain propagating addition polymerizable compound , ( 2 ) a compound of this invention , and ( 3 ) optionally , one or more fillers , binders , dyes , polymerization inhibitors , color precursors , oxygen scavengers , etc . the compounds of this invention should be present in an amount sufficient to initiate polymerization of said polymerizable compound . suitable ratios of ingredients are as follows : for every 100 parts of polymerizable compound there can be from 0 . 005 to 10 parts of photoinitiator , from 0 to 200 parts of filler , from 0 to 200 parts of binder , and from 0 to 10 or more parts of dyes , polymerization inhibitors , color precursors , oxygen scavengers , etc , as may be needed for a particular use of the photopolymerizable compositions . preferably , from 1 to 7 . 5 parts of the compound of this invention and from 25 to 150 parts of binder are used per 100 parts of polymerizable compound . unsaturated , free -

acryloxy - 2 - hydroxypropoxy ) phenyl ] dimethylmethane , and bis [ p -( 2 - acryloxyethoxy ) phenyl ] dimethylmethane . mixtures of these esters can also be used as can mixtures of these esters with alkyl esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid , including such esters as methyl acrylate , methyl methacrylate , ethyl acrylate , isopropyl methacrylate , n - hexyl acrylate , stearyl acrylate , allyl acrylate , diallyl phthalate , and the like . to prepare the photosensitive compositions of this invention , the components can be admixed in any order and stirred or milled to form a solution or uniform dispersion . photosensitive elements can be made by coating a photosensitive composition on a suitable base or support and drying the coating . the dry thickness typically ranges from about 0 . 00005 to about 0 . 075 inch . suitable bases or supports for the photosensitive compositions include metals , e . g ., steel and aluminum plates , sheets and foils , and films or plates composed of various film - forming synthetic or high polymers including addition polymers , e . g . vinylidene chloride , vinyl chloride , vinyl acetate , styrene , isobutylene polymers and copolymers and linear condensation polymers e . g ., polyethylene terephthalate , polyhexamethylene adipate , polyhexamethylene adipamide / adipate . the invention will be more specifically illustrated by the following examples . the value of λmax was measured in methanol , unless otherwise indicated . this example illustrates preparation of 4 -

( see fig5 .) the electrical control - drive unit ( 88 ) can , instead , be a manual control ( of the angle of the adjustable baffleplate ), such as , manually turning the rod ( 88a ). the other end of the recycle segment ( 111 ) and the other end of the bottomflow segment ( 106 ) are joined to openings in a upflow segment ( 107 ). at one end of the upflow segment ( 107 ) is a flange ( 82 ) which is attached to a flange ( 82a ) at one end of an elbow ( 103 ). the other end of this elbow ( 103 ) is attached to a vertical , exit pipe segment ( 108 ). attached to the other end of the vertical , exit pipe segment ( 108 ) is another elbow ( 103 ) through which the sewage exits ( 109 ). running into the elbow ( 103 ) which is attached both to the vertical inlet pipe segment ( 104 ) and the downflow segment ( 105 ) are polymer or flocculant injection lines ( 84 ). attached to the other end of these polymer or flocculant injection lines ( 84 ) are a manifold ( 85 ), a quick connect ( 86 ), a motor ( 115 ) and a control valve ( 114 ). ( see fig6 .) a dip tube ( 113 ) runs from the control valve ( 114 ) into a barrel ( 112 ) resting on the trailer ( 110 ). preferably the polymer mixing and injecting apparatus of fig1 is used to provide the activated polymer solution to barrel 112 . sewage enters an elbow ( 103 ) and runs through the vertical inlet pipe segment ( 104 ). it then passes through another elbow ( 103 ) into the downflow segment ( 105 ). as the sewage / flow passes into the downflow segment ( 105 ), it passes through a 45 degree angle . this area is called mixing zone 1 ( 83 ). as the sewage / flow runs through the downflow segment ( 105 ), it encounters an adjustable baffleplate ( 87 ), which is positioned at an angle . the adjustable baffleplate ( 87 ) restricts the vessel &# 39 ; s flow by about 50 to about 80 percent , thus increasing the original flow velocity by as much as 600 percent . then , the sewage / flow is fanned in one direction -- towards the bottomflow segment ( 106 ). a fixed baffle ( 90 ), which restricts typically 40 percent of the vessel &# 39 ; s size , is positioned in the downflow segment and serves to oppositely direct and fan the passing sewage / flow . the area between the adjustable baffleplate and the fixed baffle is called mixing zone 2 ( 89 ). then , the sewage / flow is directed into a 45 degree round angle into the bottomflow segment ( 106 ). positioned within the bottomflow segment are at least two ( preferably , a number of ) fixed , horizontal baffles ( 92 ), the positioning of which cause the sewage / flow to pass under and over and under these fixed , horizontal baffles ( 92 ) in a serpentine flow pattern , thereby reducing the flow velocity . this area is called mixing zone 3 ( 93 ). the sewage / flow , then , enters the upflow segment ( 107 ) in a 45 degree round angle which causes the sewage / flow to move in a spiraling pattern . positioned in the upflow segment ( 107 ) is ( at least one ) fixed vertical baffle ( 96 ). mixing zone 5 is in the exit end of upflow pipe 107 where it bends to the horizontal . before the sewage / flow exits the mixer - flocculator unit ( 80 ), before it enters an elbow ( 103 ) and the vertical exit pipe segment ( 108 ), it passes a horizontal pipe / recycle segment ( 111 ) which causes a portion of the sewage / flow to divert through this line , because of the pressure drop caused by the adjustable inlet baffle ( 87 ) placed at an angle . the bypass velocity may be increased , if the size of the pipe is increased and with baffle adjustments . also before the sewage / flow exits the mixer - flocculator unit ( 80 ), before it enters an elbow ( 103 ) and the vertical exit pipe segment ( 108 ), but after it passes the horizontal pipe / recycle segment ( 111 ), it passes through a 45 degree angle . this area is called mixing zone 4 ( 99 ). recycle segment ( 111 ) has a smaller diameter than the rest of the pipes of the unit . a drainage plug ( 91 ) is present in the downflow segment ( 105 ), close to where the sewage / flow enters the bottomflow segment ( 106 ). a flush plug ( 95 ) is present in the upflow segment ( 107 ) close to where it joins together with the bottomflow segment ( 106 ). model rf6 of the mixing and flocculating unit 80 os basically shown in fig5 . note the two non - flexible baffles 92 located in the bottom of bottomflow segment 106 . the results of tests using model rf6 in dewatering test are given below in table 1 and 2 . table 1______________________________________mixing zones ( velocity versus feet per second ) g . p . m . zone 1 zone 2 zone 3 zone 4 zone 5______________________________________a ) 100 1 . 28 5 . 04 2 . 89 8 . 68 1 . 28b ) 150 1 . 92 7 . 56 3 . 83 13 . 10 1 . 92c ) 200 2 . 57 10 . 10 4 . 44 17 . 4 2 . 57______________________________________ table 2__________________________________________________________________________ baffle plate emulsion polymer position sludge polymer solution (% of filtrate dried sludgevelocity con . conc . conc . vessel floc size conc .

flocculator unit having an adjustable baffleplate placed at an angle to the direction of flow of the incoming sewage ( containing , for example , 1 / 2 to 8 percent of solids ). the baffle plate restricts the flow area in downflow pipe segment 106 just before the intersection with recycle pipe segment 111 by about 50 to about 80 percent . this cross - sectional area adjustment process can increase the original flow velocity by as much as 600 percent or more . the pattern of flow of the combination of the incoming material and the recycle material , then , is moved in one direction . thereafter , flowing liquid is oppositely directed and fanned by a fixed , nonflexible baffle which restricts 40 percent or so of the internal size ( cross sectional area ) of the pipe . then , the liquid flow is directed into a 45 degree round angle which causes the liquid flow to turn and pass under and over and under fixed , nonflexible baffles in a serpentine flow pattern , thereby further reducing the velocity of flow in the pipe . thereafter , the liquid flow enters a 45 degree round angle which causes the flow to move upward in a spiraling pattern . the liquid flow , then , comes in contact with a fixed , nonflexible baffle . such baffle is located across from the entrance to a side or recycle pipe . as the upward liquid flow reaches such baffle and side horizontal recycle pipe , a portion of it to divert through this line by the action of such baffle and by the pressure drop caused by the adjustable inlet baffle plate in the down flow pipe segment 106 . the internal diameter of recycle pipe 111 is less than the internal diameter of down flow pipe 105 or upward flow pipe 107 . the bypass velocity in the recycle pipe can be increased by decreasing the size of the pipe and / or by adjusting the baffle . this recycle system allows the continued size growth of the floc . preferably the mixer - flocculator unit will have multiple injector ports at the influent end of the mixer , through which the activated polymer solution can be injected into the liquid - sludge slurry flow stream . the activated polymer and sludge will then be quickly but gently mixed by baffling energy dispersing action . the mixing action promotes large floc growth . a portion of the flocculated sludge , then , is re - circulated into the influent stream by a pressure drop zone to advance and increase the efficiency of the mixing - flocculating process . the device can be fabricated utilizing corrosion free polyvinyl chloride components , stainless steel , concrete , fiberglass , wood or any other suitable metal or other material . the interior baffles can be fabricated from polyvinyl chloride , stainless steel , concrete , fiberglass , wood or any other suitable metal or other material . with regard to the third step of the inventive process , that is , a chemical induced ph adjustment of the sewage exiting the mixer - flocculating system ( 101 ), the following is included : as the liquid / solids content exits the inline mixer - flocculator unit ( 80 ), an electronic or gear driven diaphragm pump ( not shown ) pumps liquid caustic or lime into the discharge line for example , 102 , 108 , 109 , etc .) of the flocculator - mixer unit ( 80 ). the ph of the sludge is increased to 12 by the chemical additive ( base ). the ph of the sludge will remain at 12 for 72 hours , and , during this period of time , the temperature will reach 52 ° c . and will remain at that temperature for at least 12 hours . at the end of the 72 hour period during which the ph of the sludge is above 12 , the sludge can be air dried to achieve a percent solids of greater than 50 percent . the liquid caustic or lime pump is present on the transportable dewatering trailer ( 110 ) with the mixer - flocculating system ( 101 ) and the polymer feed system and , thus , is easily transported . with regard to the fourth step of the invention process ( see fig1 ), enclosure 49 contains sand bed 44 . onto a layer of non - porous material ( 50 ), e . g ., concrete , a layer of porous material ( 53 ) is positioned . porous material ( 53 ) is used as a filter media and usually stone , crushed rock , ceramic shapes , slag and plastics of 1 to 6 inches , practically 2 to 4 inches , in size are used . stones or pebbles are preferred . at least one -- usually more than one -- projection of porous material ( 54 ) extends from the porous layer ( 53 ) into the layer of non - porous material ( 50 ). embedded in each projection channels ( 48 ) in porous material ( 54 ) is at least one non - porous pipe ( 55 ) having at least one hole ( 56 ) into which liquid can drain . a layer of sand ( 57 ) is positioned above the layer of porous material ( 53 ). the sand - cell media sections ( 65 ) are positioned above this layer of sand ( 57 ). sand is located in passageways 59 in sand cell grid ( 65 ). above each sand - cell media section ( 65 ) is placed a layer of sand ( 61 ). this layer of sand ( 61 ) is usually , though not necessarily , at least six inches in depth . walls ( 51 ) surround on all four sides of an area having one or more sand - cell media sections ( 65 )-- on wall 51 is shorter to allow a front loader or the like into the enclosure . each surrounding , dividing wall ( 51 ) extends upward from one or more footing supports ( 52 ) which are positioned , at least partially , in the layer of non - porous material ( 50 ). the top of each dividing wall ( 51 ) extends above the layer of sand ( 61 ) overlaying the sand - cell media section ( s ). on the top of each dividing wall ( 51 ) which runs between two enclosure areas having sand - cell media sections ( 65 ) is portable nozzle ( 62 ) which is used to pour sewage into the enclosures . each sand - cell media section ( 65 ) is made up of one or more sand - cells ( 58 ) having the same shape and size . typically , the sand - cell media section is made up of honeycomb - shaped sand - cells ( 58 ) which are joined together in a honeycomb formation ( i . e ., each sand - cell which is not in an outer layer , where it intersects ( 59 ) another sand - cell , it intersects three other sand - cells ). a channel ( 59 ) runs through the interior of each sand - cell . sewage is poured through the channel ( 62 ) into one or more enclosures 49 for sand beds 44 . the liquid permeates the outer sand layer , flows through the sand in the channels ( 59 ) in the grid 65 in the centers of the sand - cells , permeates the layer of sand beneath the sand - cell media , and permeates the pebble layer beneath that layer , leaving the collected sludge solids to dry from the sun and air . with regard to the fifth of the invention process ( see fig1 ), a sludge retriever ( 125 ) is used to separate the dried sludge layer ( 134 ) from the sand ( 61 ) in the sand bed ( 44 ). ( see fig1 .) an upper pivoted arm ( 130 ) is attached to a front - end loader , as is a lower pivoted arm ( 129 ). the other end of each of these pivoted arms is attached to a two cubic yard bucket / hopper ( 133 ). the lower side ( 137 ) of the bucket / hopper ( 133 ) slides along the sandbed slightly above or on the layer of dried sludge ( 134 ) being retrieved . the lower , front end ( 138 ) of this bucket / hopper ( 133 ) is upwardly slanted relative to the rest of the lower end . at the lower back end of the bucket / hopper is attached a rotary drum ( 135 ) including a shaft ( 126 ) around which a rotary ( 128 ), from which multiple raw of three inch tines / teeth ( 127 ) project , turns . as the rotary drum ( 135 ) turns ( clockwise ), pieces of dried sludge ( 134 ) and minimal amounts of sand ( 61 ) are tossed into the bucket / hopper ( 133 ). an arm ( 132 ) is attached to a ball pivot ( 131 ) which has a short arm ( 139 ) welded onto the end of ball joint ( 131 ). ball joint ( 131 ) is moved up or down in vertical slot ( 140 ) in the side of retriever ( 125 ) and moved and bolted into one of the three short horizontal slots ( 141 ), whereby shaft ( 126 ) is moved up or down to the desired position . this arrangement ( not shown ) is repeated on the other side of the retriever ( 125 ). in this manner , the height position of shaft ( 126 ) can be adjusted and accordingly the distance that vanes ( 127 ) extend below lower side ( 137 ) of retriever ( 125 ). as typically shown in fig1 , vane ( 127 ) extension levels of 1 inch , 2 inches and 3 inches are indicated by the marks &# 34 ; 1 &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; 2 &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; 3 &# 34 ;, respectively . the one inch level is usually used to chop up the dried sludge . the 2 inch level is shown in operation in fig1 . the three inch level is used , when the rotation direction of rotary ( 128 ) is reversed , to aerate the sand after the dried sludge has been removed . air flow grill or filter ( 136 ) is located in the top surface of bucket ( 133 ) near its front . with regard to the optional ( sixth ) step of the invention , that is , dewatering the sewage using an inline vertically - oriented , pneumatic dewatering tube ( 164 ) between steps ( a ) and ( b ) or ( b ) and ( c ) or ( c ) and ( d ), or before step ( a ), see fig1 . a cylindrical - shaped screen filter ( 150 ) reinforcing ribs ( 151 ), usually composed of stainless steel . rim rings ( 159 ) connect the circular - shaped screen filter ( 150 ) with a rim block ( 163 ). running through the rim ( 163 ) are water exit passageways ( 158 ). the flanged ends of cylindrical shell ( 153 ) are bolted ( 161 ) together with rim block ( 163 ). in this shell ( 153 ) are peripheral air chambers ( 154 ) which traverse the entire circumference of shell ( 153 ). one end of the water exit passageways ( 158 ) opens into the area in between the shell ( 153 ) and filter ( 151 ). positioned in this area are staggered , pressurized air jets ( 152 ) communicating with air chambers ( 154 ). manifolds ( 155 ) are positioned outside of shell ( 153 ) and communicate with every other circular air chamber ( 154 ), and hence to every other bank of pressurized air jets ( 152 ). use of the pneumatic dewatering device or tube ( 164 ) involves conducting ( 160 ) the sewage into the central tube - shaped filter where solids in the sewage are caught on the filter ( 150 ) and part of the water in the sewage passes through the filter ( 150 ). air under pressure is blown from staggered , high pressure air jets ( 152 ) against the outer surface of the filter ( 150 ) to dislodge the solids collected on the inner surface of the filter ( 150 ). the blowing air jets ( 152 ) are alternated in on - off sequences in order to continuously provide regions of the filter for the water to come through unimpeded by blowing pressurized air . in an alternate form of the invention ( see fig1 , as opposed to that which is portrayed in fig1 ), there is not a liquid exit passageway ( 158 ) running through each rim ( 163 ) through which liquid sewage is dispelled ( 157 ). rather , there is a channel ( 162 ) for sewage to flow through the rim ( 163 ) from one section to another and then out the bottom . in connection with the figures , the following list of the names of the parts of the instant invention are noted : ______________________________________numbers parts , etc . ______________________________________40 sewage ;

"an alarm network for a building 8 , or the like , having a plurality of audible alarms 10 disposed at various locations throughout the building is shown in fig1 . an audible alarm 10 , in this case a smoke detector , is disposed in the basement , the kitchen , the living room , the central hallway to the bedroom and in the master bedroom . even when some of the alarms are disposed on different floors of the building , and even though these alarms may be separated by closed doors , it is clear that an audible alarm having a typically loud alarm signal will be within audible range ( with respect to distance ) of at least one other of the alarms in the network . the alarm in the basement may not be within audible range of the alarm in the master bedroom , but it is certainly within audible range of the alarm in the kitchen . even if the alarm in the kitchen is not within audible range of the master bedroom , it is within audible range of the alarm in the living room . even if the alarm in the living room is not within audible range of the alarm in the bedroom , it is certainly within audible range of the alarm in the central hallway leading to the bedroom . finally , the alarm in the central hallway is within audible range of the alarm in the master bedroom . based even upon simple tests of sounding the alarm , one without any skill in the art can determine whether or not a particular alarm is safely within audible range of any other alarm . such a test would be conducted under the most adverse conditions , for example , with any intervening doors closed and any noise sources , apart from the alarm , activated . the ability to maintain the ease and simplicity of self - installation is a very important part of this invention . each alarm 10 according to this invention , and as shown in block diagram in fig2 comprises : an audible alarm , such as horn 12 , for producing an audible alarm signal having at least one predetermined or encoded identifiable characteristic ; means 14 for driving the audible alarm ; means 16 for detecting an abnormal condition ; means for detecting an audible alarm signal produced by another alarm ; and , triggering means 18 for enabling the alarm driving means in response to detection of either one of the abnormal condition and the audible alarm signal . the means for detecting an audible alarm signal produced by another alarm comprises a microphone or transducer 20 , a sound discriminator 22 attuned to at least one identifiable characteristic of the audible alarm signal , and means 24 for timing the duration of the at least one identifiable characteristic , a duration of two ( 2 ) to five ( 5 ) seconds being presently preferred . the alarm may further comprise means 26 for inhibiting production of the audible alarm signal for a predetermined time period , during which a number of activated alarms may be sequentially deactivated without an immediate automatic reactivation . in terms of a fire or smoke detector , the abnormal condition detector 16 , trigger 18 , alarm driver 14 and audible signaling device 12 are known in the art , and many variations thereof are incorporated into the many smoke detectors now available in the marketplace . one such circuit , which incorporates both ionization chamber and photoelectric detectors is disclosed in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 225 , 860 - conforti , the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference . in the dual input fire detector disclosed therein , it is necessary for the alarm to detect both visible and invisible products of combustion in order to sound the alarm . the outputs of the individual detectors form the inputs to a logical and gate , the output of which determines whether or not the audible alarm signal , in this case a horn , is to be activated . at this point in the circuit , namely at the signal indicating the presence of an abnormal condition , the means for detecting the audible alarm signal produced by another alarm may be connected or interjected , by means of a logical or gate or the like . such a circuit is illustrated in fig7 . a nand gate 30 has two inputs 32 and 34 . a high voltage or logic level &# 34 ; 1 &# 34 ; on line 32 indicates that the ionization chamber has detected predominantly invisible products of combustion . a high or logic level &# 34 ; 1 &# 34 ; on input line 34 indicates that the photoelectric cell has detected predominantly visible products of combustion . when both input lines 32 and 34 are high , indicating that a fire has been detected , the output line 36 , designated fire detected , goes low , a logic level &# 34 ; 0 &# 34 ;. in conventional fashion , signals which are &# 34 ; active low &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; low voltage true &# 34 ; or &# 34 ; high voltage false &# 34 ; at a particular place in the circuit are indicated by a line or &# 34 ; bar &# 34 ; over the signal name . line 36 forms one input to a nor gate 38 . nor gate 38 has a second input line 40 . input line 40 is connected to that signal which indicates that the audible alarm signal of another smoke detector has been detected , the signal being designated audible alarm signal detected . when either input 36 or 40 goes low , a logic level &# 34 ; 0 &# 34 ;, the output line 42 , designated detection , of nor gate 38 goes high , a logic level &# 34 ; 1 &# 34 ;, indicating that an alarm condition exists . depending upon the particular design chosen for the circuit , the logical functions could be performed by various positive rather than negative logic gates , or a mixture thereof . in a similar fashion , this invention could be incorporated into a combination fire and burglar alarm , as that shown in u . s . pat . no . 3 , 678 , 511 - benedict , the teachings of which are incorporated herein . however the connection is accomplished , it can be seen that the additional triggering mechanism interferes to a minimum extent with existing detector circuitry . irrespective of the abnormal condition which is to be detected , which need not necessarily be fire or smoke , a suitable alarm driver , including an audio signal generator is disclosed in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 079 , 271 - peil , the subject matter of which is also incorporated herein . those frequencies of sound most audible to persons are in the range of from 2 , 500 - 3 , 000 hertz ( hz ). most smoke detectors , for example , have audible alarm signals within that range . accordingly , the simplest of the presently preferred embodiments for the sound discriminator 22 is a narrow band - pass filter attuned to the chosen or existing operating frequency of the audible alarm signal . the band - pass filter should be as narrow as possible , in order to reduce the possibility of false alarms , and need only be as wide as the actual range of frequencies within which the audible alarm signal will operate . it is expected that as components are manufactured and selected only within certain tolerances , that no two audible alarm signals will be precisely alike , although that is possible . if the audio signal generator includes , for example , a resonant reed relay or a crystal oscillator , or the like , the frequencies can be very closely controlled . more particularly , the tolerances of components chosen , and the resulting capability of the detector to distinguish between an alarm condition and noise , will of course be a function of cost . at one end of the range of cost , an alarm signal generated by an inexpensive resonant reed relay could be detected using a similar resonant reed switch . at the other end of the range , a temperature compensated crystal oscillator signal could be counted down to the desired frequency and amplified , to be detected and compared to a clock signal generated by a similar oscillator in the receiving alarm unit . it is presently preferred that , for reasons of costs , the oscillator be composed of standard tolerance components ( e . g ., 5 % or 10 %), and that the frequency output be adjusted to a predetermined alarm frequency at the center of the band - pass of the detector , using a variable capacitor or potentiometer , when the unit is first built . in a unit employing the tuned frequency alarm signal and band - pass detector scheme , there are certain frequencies which should be avoided . inasmuch as many electrical appliances run at the power frequency , any multiple of 60 hz should be avoided . similarly , the usual frequencies of television horizontal oscillators and multiples thereof could cause generation of spurious alarm signals . in a somewhat more sophisticated version , the sound discriminator 22 may include a narrow band - pass filter 50 and a code detector 52 , as shown in fig3 . in the event that the audible alarm signal is not a continuous signal , but is a repetitive signal , in order to differentiate or prevent false alarms , it will be necessary not only to detect an audible alarm having the correct characteristic frequency , but also one which has the properly coded on - off characteristic . a suitable code detector 52 is illustrated in fig4 and comprises a pulse width detector 54 and a pulse repetition rate detector 56 . each decoder will be adjusted or tuned in accordance with the encoder which drives the audible alarm signaling device . each of these elements , the encoder , the narrow band - pass filter , the pulse width detector and the pulse repetition rate detector are well known to those skilled in the art , and need not be precisely illustrated herein . an operational difficulty has been anticipated in connection with audible alarms according to this invention . if the alarms are being tested , or if all of the alarms have been activated in response to a false alarm , it then becomes necessary to turn all of the alarms off . as a practical matter , it is nearly impossible to arrange turning off each of the alarm simultaneously . accordingly , as long as any alarm within audible range was still activated , any other alarm which was turned off would immediately thereafter be automatically reactivated . in order to preclude this possibility , means for inhibiting production of the audible alarm is provided . in the simplest of the preferred embodiments , the inhibit alarm may be a timer , electrical or mechanical , which can be set , for example , at 5 , 10 , or 15 minutes . alternatively , the length of time may be adjustable . electronically , the inhibit alarm might be a monostable multi - vibrator or oneshot , having a very long time - out . alternatively , it might be a simple mechanical countdown timer . the manner in which the inhibit alarm may be connected is also illustrated in fig7 . line 42 forms one input of a nand gate 60 . the other input line 62 is designated inhibit alarm . when line 62 is low , a logic level &# 34 ; 0 &# 34 ;, the means 26 for inhibiting the alarm have been activated , indicating no alarm should sound . when line 62 is high , a logic level &# 34 ; 1 &# 34 ;, the means 26 for inhibiting the alarm is inactive , and normal operation is in order . accordingly , when both inputs 60 and 62 go high , indicating the presence of an alarm condition and the absence of an inhibit alarm instruction , the output line 64 , designated enable alarm , goes low , a logic level &# 34 ; 0 &# 34 ;, whereby the audible alarm is sounded . if input line 62 is low , indicating the presence of an inhibit alarm instruction , output line 64 will be locked high , preventing operation of the audible alarm . as indicated in fig2 and 7 , it is presently preferred that the inhibit alarm means be connected to the trigger . as shown by the dotted lines in fig2 the inhibit alarm function may also be interjected elsewhere , for example in the timer 24 or in the line between the sound discriminator 22 and the timer 24 . if the user is willing to visit each alarm twice , to reactivate inhibited alarms , the function can be accomplished by an on - off switch . however , for a variety of reasons , the reactivation process may be interrupted , forgotten or only partially accomplished . this defeats the otherwise &# 34 ; fail - safe &# 34 ; nature of the of the alarm , and is not presently preferred . in the event of repetitive false alarms , or in the aftermath of a fire , it may be desirable to know which of the detectors was activated in response to the abnormal condition , as it will be an indication that the fire began in its vicinity or that a particular alarm unit is defective . an alternative embodiment of the trigger 18 in fig2 which would accomplish this is illustrated in fig5 . the outputs of the timer 24 and abnormal condition detector 16 would be inputs to an electromechanical marker 70 . in the event of false alarms , a light held by an electronic latch , such as a flip - flop , would be adequate , and if a liquid crystal display were utilized , the power consumption would not be unreasonable . however , a light system would not be suitable where a fire has finally put the alarm out of operation . in such an instance , assuming that destruction of the alarm was not utter and complete , a mechanical marker having a visible indication would be preferable . for example , a magnetic &# 34 ; flag &# 34 ; might be provided which has a brightly colored marking thereon , the position of which would be shifted , perhaps with respect to a number of adjacent windows . the movement of and the position of the &# 34 ; flag &# 34 ; would depend upon whether a signal was received first from the timer or first from the abnormal condition detector . the same signal which sets the mechanical &# 34 ; flag &# 34 ; can also be used as an input to the enable alarm driver circuitry 72 . resetting the mechanical &# 34 ; flag &# 34 ; can be adapted to initiate the inhibit timer . it is also contemplated that the principles of the invention can be incorporated into an auxiliary triggering mechanism to be added to existing self - contained audible alarm units . such a use is illustrated in fig6 . components of the existing alarm are shown in dotted box 74 . they include a smoke detector 76 , a trigger 18 , an alarm driver 14 and an audible alarm signaling device 12 . the auxiliary triggering mechanism includes a microphone or transducer 20 , a sound discriminator 22 , a timer 24 , an auxiliary trigger 78 and means for inhibiting production of the alarm 26 . the mechanism would be attached or interjected substantially as shown in fig7 and would be powered by the existing battery source . overall , this invention provides not only an improved audible alarm , but a simple means by which existing audible alarms may be formed into an operationally unified network which enhances operation for increased safety . in either embodiment , a minimum of additional power is required , as the existing audible alarm signaling devices are utilized as the communicating means between alarms in the system or network . finally , because the alarms are in fact so utilized as the communicating means , the overall alarm signal , in terms of absolute volume and ability to attract attention , is greatly multiplied . this invention represents a significant advance in audible alarm systems in general , and in smoke detector systems in particular , and has the capability of saving many more lives without significant additional costs . this invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof , and accordingly , reference should be made to the appended claims , rather than the foregoing specification , as indicating the scope of the invention .",6

"in accordance with the present invention it has been discovered , surprisingly , that for the improvement of extrusion behavior , difficultly melt - processible polymers which contain combinations of fluorocarbon polymers ( hereinafter called type ( 1 ) fluorocarbon polymers ) that are above their melting points if crystalline , or above their glass transition temperatures if amorphous , and are thus molten and fluid at the polymer - processing temperatures , and crystalline or amorphous fluorocarbon polymers ( herinafter called type ( 2 ) fluorocarbon polymers ) that are solid at the polymer melt - processing temperatures , have significant advantage over such difficultly melt - processible polymers which contain equivalent , or even greater , amounts of extrusion - modifying additives of the art , as in u . s . pat . no . 3 , 125 , 547 ( supra ). the term &# 34 ; extrusion behavior &# 34 ; is intended to include such parameters as the operating melt temperatures , die pressure reached during extrusion , maintenance of a steady die pressure during extrusion , maximum extrusion rates that can be achieved , maintenance of a steady extrusion rate , dimensional stability of the melt , absence of deposits of decomposed polymer or additives at the exit of the die surface and good surface quality of the extruded part . in some cases the invention may provide a means for carrying out the extrusion at a lower temperature . blow molding , tubing manufacture and fiber spinning represent examples of extrusion processes that may be improved by means of this invention . thus , the compositions of this invention , compared to polymers not containing both types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) fluorocarbon polymers will show improved extrusion behavior , incorporating improvements in at least some of the parameters noted above . with respect to the fluorocarbon polymer process aid of this invention , it has been independently discovered that there must be present an effective amount of polar functional groups selected from -- cof , so 2 f , -- so 2 cl , -- so 3 m , -- oso 3 m , -- coor , and -- coom , wherein r is a c 1 - 3 alkyl group and m is hydrogen , a metal cation , preferably an alkali or alkaline earth metal cation , or a quaternary ammonium cation . such functionality is usually present in the process aid : ( 1 ) as polymer chain end groups introduced during the polymerization or copolymerization , ( 2 ) by copolymerization of a functional - group - containing monomer , or ( 3 ) by subjecting the fluorocarbon polymer to ionizing radiation . the fluorocarbon polymers of type ( 1 ) are those that are fluid at the melt - processing temperature of the difficultly melt - processible polymer . thus , at processing temperature they must be above their melting point if crystalline , or above their glass transition temperature if amorphous , up to a suitable operating temperature , preferably no more than 300 ° c ., more preferably no more than 200 ° c . the polymers should have sufficiently high molecular weight , with number average molecular weights greater than about 10 , 000 , such that they do not exude from the difficultly melt - processible polymer extrudate at melt - processing temperatures . with respect to their chemical composition , it is preferred , but not essential , to employ fluorocarbon polymers having a fluorine to hydrogen ratio of at least 1 : 1 . 5 . fluorinated monomers which give rise to suitable polymers include vinylidene fluoride , hexafluoropropylene , chlorotrifluoroethylene , tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl ethers . specific examples of the fluorocarbon polymers of type ( 1 ) that may be employed in this invention include copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and a monomer selected from hexafluoropropylene , chlorotrifluoroethylene , 1 - hydropentafluoropropylene and 2 - hydropentafluoropropylene ; copolymers of vinylidene fluoride , tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene or 1 - or 2 - hydropentafluoropropylene ; copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and propylene and , optionally , vinylidene fluoride ; copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and a perfluoro ( alkyl vinyl ether ), preferably perfluoro ( methyl vinyl ether ), optionally containing a small amount ( up to 2 mole %) of a third monomer ; and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene , all of which are known in the art . the presence or absence of the third monomer is of no known consequence in this invention . in some cases these copolymers may also include a bromo - containing cure site monomer as taught in apotheker and krusic , u . s . pat . no . 4 , 035 , 565 , or terminal iodo - groups , as taught in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 243 , 770 . the latter patent also discloses the use of iodo group - containing fluoroolefin comonomers . when certain molar ratios of monomers are used in these copolymers , then the glass transition temperature is near or below 0 ° c . ; many of these polymers are useful elastomers that are readily available articles of commerce . the fluorocarbon polymers of type ( 2 ) that are solid at the melt processing temperature of the difficultly melt - processible polymer include homopolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene with certain copolymerizable monomers . the selection of the fluorocarbon polymer of type ( 2 ) is not limited to high molecular weight polymers , whether the polymer is melt - processible or not melt - processible , whether the polymer is made by dispersion polymerization or suspension polymerization , or how much comonomer is present , except as stated above . for example , if excessive amounts of comonomer are used , the polymer will not be a solid at the temperature used for melt processing the difficultly melt - processible polymer ; or , if a copolymer has too low a molecular weight , the copolymer may not be a solid at the temperature used for melt processing the difficultly melt - processible polymer . suitable tetrafluoroethylene homopolymers include those that are high molecular weight and fibrillate , or do not fibrillate to a substantial extent , under shearing conditions , as well as those which are low molecular weight and non - fibrillating , such as those which have been subjected to ionizing radiation . suitable monomers copolymerizable with tetrafluoroethylene to give melt - processible copolymers are ethylene , perfluoroolefins such as hexafluoropropylene , and perfluoro ( alkyl vinyl ethers ) such as perfluoro ( propyl vinyl ether ) and perfluoro ( alkyl vinyl ethers ) which contain functional groups such as -- so 2 f or -- cooch 3 . more than one comonomer may be used , provided all the aforesaid requirements are met . in certain instances , when the difficultly - melt - processible polymer is processed at a high temperature , for example , a polyester or polyamide , some type ( 2 ) fluorocarbon polymers , for example , tetrafluoroethylene / hexafluoropropylene copolymers , may also serve as a type ( 1 ) fluorocarbon polymer . the effect of the combined addition of fluorocarbon polymers types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in eliminating roughness of the extrudate , allowing increases in extrusion speed and reducing die pressures is significantly greater than when either type ( 1 ) or type ( 2 ) is used alone at concentrations equal to the sum of the concentrations of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). in some cases it has been shown also that combining types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), at total concentrations equal to or greater than that of the combined concentrations of additives , also produces unexpected improvements in certain extrusion parameters , for example , reduction or elimination of die pressure fluctuations , reduction of deposits at the die exit , reduction in the pressure required to operate the screw of the extruder , resulting in an increase in the time an extrusion can be carried out or in an increase in the throughput of polymer . it has been found in some instances that even when ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are added at total concentrations as low as 0 . 0025 wt . %, all extrudate roughness is eliminated at extrusion shear rates well beyond 1000 sec - 1 ( example 2 ). quantities in excess of 1 wt . % are not necessary . in general , if the fluorocarbon polymers are not compatible with the difficultly melt - processible polymer , that is to say , are not soluble in such polymer , the addition of higher levels serves no useful purpose , and when the incompatible fraction becomes too large , it may adversely affect the optical properties of the extrudate . such is the case , for example , when the difficultly melt - processible polymer is a hydrocarbon polymer . the beneficial effects of even very low ratios of types ( 1 ) to ( 2 ) or types ( 2 ) to ( 1 ) are readily evident but , in general , there will be an optimum ratio of types ( 1 ) to ( 2 ) which may be determined experimentally for any particular combination of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). the weight ratio of fluorocarbon polymer type ( 1 ) to fluorocarbon polymer type ( 2 ) may vary from 2 / 98 to 95 / 5 , preferably from 10 / 90 to 90 / 10 . difficultly - melt - processible polymers are defined as those that either require uneconomically high extrusion pressures or temperatures for extrusion or extrude with unacceptable melt fracture , such that the surfaces of the extrudate are blemished under conditions that would be otherwise technically feasible or economically attractive ; those that give excessive deposits of resin , decomposed resin or additives at the die exit ( orifice ); those that extrude under conditions such that large fluctuations in barrel or die pressure are experienced , sometimes to the extent that the pressure limit of the extruder is reached , resulting in automatic shutdown of the extruder . examples of difficultly - melt - processible polymers that may be operable in connection with the compositions and processes of the invention include the following : mono - olefin polymers , such as ethylene homopolymers and copolymers ; vinyl aromatic polymers , such as polystyrene ; copolymers of alpha - olefins , particularly ethylene , with vinyl esters , such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate , with ( meth ) acrylic esters , such as ethyl or methyl acrylate , with acrylonitrile , and with ( meth ) acrylic acids and their ( ionomeric ) metal salts and the like ; chlorinated polyethylene ; polyvinyl chloride ; polyester ; and polyamide . the difficultly - melt - processible polymer may also be a polymer blend or polymer alloy . it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that for those resins that extrude at high temperatures and , in addition , are chemically sensitive , for example , polyester or polyamide , it is important to select fluorocarbon process aids that are thermally stable at the process temperatures . generally speaking , such polymers are those that are very nearly perfluorinated , such as copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene and other perfluoroolefins . copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene may dehydrohalogenate at temperatures in excess of about 250 ° c . and are of lesser utility under these conditions . when the difficultly melt - processible polymer is a hydrocarbon polymer that is used , for example , in blown film extrusion , it will generally have a melt index ( astm d - 1238 ) at 190 ° c . of 5 or less , preferably 3 or less . for a high shear operation , such as fiber extrusion or injection molding , even higher melt index resins , for example , having a melt index of 20 or more , may suffer extrusion difficulties . in the case of a hydrocarbon polymer component of the composition of this invention , it may comprise an elastomeric copolymer of ethylene and propylene and , optionally , a non - conjugated diene monomer , for example , 1 , 4 - hexadiene , or , in general , any thermoplastic hydrocarbon polymer obtained by the homopolymerization or copolymerization of a monoolefin ( s ) of the formula ch 2 ═ chr , where r is h or an alkyl radical , usually of not more than eight carbon atoms . in particular , this invention is applicable to polyethylene , both of the high density type and the low density type , for example , densities within the range 0 . 89 to 0 . 97 ; polypropylene ; polybutene - 1 ; poly ( 3 - methylbutene ); poly ( methylpentene ); and linear low density copolymers of ethylene and an alpha - olefin such as propylene , butene - 1 , octene - 1 , hexene - 1 , decene - 1 , octadecene , or 4 - methylpentene - 1 . similarly , the invention is also applicable to blends of difficultly melt - processible polymers , and difficultly melt - processible polymers containing additives , such as antioxidants , light stabilizers , antiblocking agents , pigments , etc . difficultly - melt - processible polyesters are condensation polymers derived from dicarboxylic acids and dialcohols and / or from hydrocarboxylic acids or the corresponding lactones , such as polyethylene terephthalate , polybutylene terephthalate and poly - 1 , 4 - dimethylolcyclohexane terephthalate . difficultly - melt - processible polyamides and copolyamides are derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids and / or amino acids or the corresponding lactams , such as polyamide 6 , polyamide 6 / 6 , polyamide 6 / 10 , polyamide 11 and polyamide 12 . because of the different melt characteristics of the various difficultly - melt - processible polymers disclosed hereinabove , the addition of the types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) fluorocarbon polymers may be of greater value in some polymers than in others . thus , for example , hydrocarbon polymers , such as polypropylene and branched polyethylene , that are not of high molecular weight have good melt flow characteristics even at low temperatures , so that surface roughness and other surface defects can be avoided by adjustment of extrusion conditions . such hydrocarbon polymers may not require the use of the fluorocarbon polymer additives of this invention , or be noticeably improved by them , except under unusual , adverse extrusion conditions . such polymers , therefore , are considered herein as not difficultly melt - processible polymers . however , other polymers , such as high molecular weight , high density polyethylene or linear low density ethylene copolymers , particularly those with narrow molecular weight distributions , do not have this degree of freedom in the variation of extrusion conditions and it is particularly with these resins that remarkable improvements in the surface quality of the extruded product are obtained with compositions containing the described type ( 1 ) and type ( 2 ) fluorocarbon polymers . it will also be recognized by one skilled in the art that it may not be possible to achieve , simultaneously , reduced die pressure , increased throughput , improved surface quality or reduced pressure fluctuations to the maximum extent at given concentration of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). thus , one might elect to attain maximum improvement in one parameter , in particular , at the expense of corresponding improvements in other parameters . for example , increased output of extrudate with high quality surface characteristics may not necessarily be accompanied by reduced die pressure . moreover , certain difficultly - melt - processible polymers may show no melt fracture , but may require extremely high extrusion pressure in the absence of the processing aid of the invention . the best set of conditions will be determined by the specific requirements of the extrusion . the addition of the fluorocarbon polymer modifiers to the difficultly melt - processible polymer can be accomplished by any of the means heretofore developed for the addition of modifiers to such polymers . for example , the fluorocarbon polymers ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) may be added independently to , for example , a hydrocarbon polymer on a rubber compounding mill or in a banbury or other internal mixer or in a mixing extruder , in all of which the fluorocarbon polymers are uniformly distributed throughout the host polymer . it is also feasible to dry - blend the two fluoropolymers with the host polymer in the solid state , and then effect uniform distribution of the fluoropolymers in the melt extruder employed in the fabrication by using an extruder screw with good mixing capability . alternatively , masterbatch dispersions ( mixtures ) of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in a diluent polymer , either together or separately , can be metered to the feed section of the extruder by appropriate devices . the diluent polymer can be a difficultly melt - processible polymer , or it can be a compatible melt - processible polymer that does not substantially deleteriously affect the interaction of the aforesaid components ( a ), ( b )( 1 ) and ( b )( 2 ) in achieving the beneficial effects of the invention . for example , the diluent polymer can be a melt - processible hydrocarbon polymer , such as a homopolymer or copolymer of a monoolefin ( s ) of the formula rch ═ ch 2 wherein r is h or an alkyl radical , usually of not more than eight carbon atoms . in most cases such a hydrocarbon polymer will have a melt index ( astm d - 1238 ) at 190 ° c . of 20 . 0 or less , preferably 5 . 0 or less . in preparing such masterbatches the amounts of fluorocarbon polymers types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) will usually be such that they provide 1 - 25 wt . %, preferably 1 - 10 wt . %, most preferably 1 - 5 wt . %, of the masterbatch . further to the above regarding the need to avoid adversely affecting the beneficial effects of the invention , in preparing the masterbatch , the concentrations of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), as well as the diluent polymer , will be selected so as to achieve good mixing of all the ingredients . particularly , fibrillation of the fluorocarbon polymer type ( 2 ) is to be avoided . in any of the above procedures , it is also possible to employ previously prepared mixtures of fluorocarbon polymer type ( 1 ) with fluorocarbon polymer type ( 2 ). in the practice of this invention , it will be found that the beneficial effects are not necessarily observed immediately on the onset of extrusion , and depending on the overall concentrations of modifier , it may take from 10 minutes to 8 hours to reach stable extrusion rate and die pressure . longer times are required at low concentrations of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). when it is desirable to operate at very low levels of modifiers and hasten the achievement of equilibrium , it may be expedient to first &# 34 ; condition &# 34 ; the extruder rapidly using a composition containing 0 . 1 to 1 wt . % of the fluorocarbon polymers types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), and then to switch to the desired concentrations of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). just as it has been observed that the beneficial effects may not be observed immediately , it has also been observed that the beneficial effects may continue to be observed after addition of the fluorocarbon polymers of types ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is discontinued . consistent with this observation , after stable extrusion rate and die pressure are achieved , the beneficial effects of the invention may be realized by alternating a feed of difficultly melt - processible polymer and one containing the processing aid of the invention . except where noted , the evaluations reported below employ a c . w . brabender computerized plasti - corder equipped with a 19 . 1 mm ( 3 / 4 in .) diameter extruder with a 25 / 1 length / diameter ratio . the screw has ten feed flights , 10 compression flights with a compression ratio of 3 : 1 , and 5 metering flights . operating parameters are controlled by five independent heating zones ( no . 5 closest to the die ), four pressure transducers and a torque - measuring drive unit with 1 - 120 rpm capability . the instrument is equipped with software for rheometric capillary extrusion testing . the capillary die , made from # 416 nitrided stainless steel , has a diameter of 2 mm and a length of 40 mm , unless otherwise noted . in operation , the required machine conditions are set and the polymer is then extruded , usually at 40 rpm , until equilibrium ( constant throughput and constant die pressure ) is reached . for a linear low density polyethylene with a melt index at 190 ° c . of 1 , extrusion at 40 rpm at 204 ° c . gives a throughput of about 19 - 20 g / min . and a die pressure of 28 mpa ( comparative example 1 ). for experiments that are run in sequence , by changing the feed composition , the initial output parameters correspond to the previous equilibrium , and then gradually change to a new equilibrium . when equilibrium is achieved a range of screw speeds is then run to produce new equilibrium values of throughput and die pressure . the relation between throughput and die pressure is determined from a plot of the data , and die pressure data at certain fixed production rates can be estimated for comparison of data between experiments . surface quality of the extrudate is judged by visual examination . after each run the extruder is thoroughly cleaned . the equipment is first purged with a highly filled abrasive composition , for example , the commercially available ucc - dfd - 0964 . the capillary die is removed and heated with a propane torch until it is free of polymer and has reached a red glow . the extruder is disassembled and each section -- screw , barrel , die assembly , and transducers -- is cleaned , first with a wire brush , and then with methyl ethyl ketone solvent . after reassembly and calibration of the transducers , the unmodified hydrocarbon polymer is run first to establish equilibrium conditions , and to assure that reliable output is being obtained . for this purpose , the equilibrium value at 40 rpm , only , was sometimes used . if previously established equilibrium values for unmodified polymer are not achieved , the cleanout procedure is repeated . in table 1 the various materials used in the examples which follow are identified . hydrocarbon polymer a was introduced to the extruder with the screw operating at 40 rpm and heating zones nos . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 controlling at nominal temperature settings of 150 , 180 , 200 , 204 , and 204 ° c ., respectively ( no . 5 is closest to the die ). equilibrium extrusion conditions , when throughput and die pressure were constant , were reached after a period of 15 min . the screw rpm was then systematically varied from 12 rpm to 60 rpm . after determining the extrusion rate at various screw speeds , the data were input to a computer program which generated a curve of die pressure vs . throughput ( shown in curve 1 of fig1 which is a part of this specification ). selected values taken from curve 1 are shown in table 2 . the extrudates of hydrocarbon polymer a had surface roughness at all extrusion rates above about 4 g / min . hydrocarbon polymer a which , as a dry blend , had intimately dispersed therein 0 . 1 % of fluorocarbon polymer 2a , was added to the extruder just at the end of comparative example 1 , at the same nominal temperature settings and at a screw speed of 40 rpm . steady state was achieved after 10 min . and did not change after a further 240 min . the die pressure / throughput relationship was then obtained as in comparative example 1 and is shown in curve 2 of fig1 . data are shown in table 2 . there was no significant effect of fluorocarbon polymer 2a , alone , on the flow characteristics of hydrocarbon polymer a , and surface roughness appeared at all extrusion rates above about 4 g / min . an extruder warm -

processible polymer , was extruded and evaluated as in example 1 . a control experiment in which the difficultly melt - processible polymer contained 0 . 04 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymer 1b , alone , was also carried out . data in table 4 show that the composition of this invention extrudes at very much lower die pressures than the control and the extrudate is free of surface imperfections at much higher extrusion rates , even though it contains only half as much total modifier . a composition of hydrocarbon polymer a containing an intimate dry powder mix of fluorocarbon polymers 1c and 2a , 0 . 01 wt . % of each , based on hydrocarbon polymer , was extruded and evaluated as in example 1 . a control experiment in which the hydrocarbon polymer contained 0 . 04 part by wt . of fluorocarbon polymer 1c , alone , was also carried out . data in table 4 show that the composition of this example extrudes at very much lower die pressures than the control and the extrudate is free of surface imperfections at much higher extrusion rates , even though it contains only half as much total modifier . for each example , hydrocarbon polymer a , which as a dry blend had intimately dispersed therein 0 . 01 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymer 1a and 0 . 01 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymers 2b , 2c , 2d , 2e , or 2f ( examples 6 - 10 , respectively ), was added to the extruder and treated in the manner described in example 1 . as shown by the data in table 5 , the new equilibria were then established after 180 minutes , at lower pressures than for the controls represented by comparative examples 1 and 3 , table 2 . all extrudate surfaces were smooth and glossy throughout the range of extrusion rates up to 38 g / min . compositions of hydrocarbon polymer a and 0 . 10 wt . % of any of the fluorocarbon polymers 2b , 2c , 2d , 2e and 2f showed no improvement in extrusion behavior ( data not shown ). in these examples hydrocarbon polymers b and c were compared in formulations containing dry blends of fluorocarbon polymers 1a and 2a in the amounts shown in table 6 . die pressure / extrusion rate data were evaluated as outlined in example 1 . for each example there is a control sample containing no additives and another showing the effect of fluorocarbon polymer 1a alone . data were analyzed as in example 1 and are shown in table 6 . in this experiment a chrome -

( a ) a commercially available extrusion grade polystyrene , styron 685d ( dow chemical co . ), density 1 . 40 g / cc , melt flow rate 1 . 6 g / 10 min ., was fed to the extruder , equipped with a new die , with the screw operating at 5 rpm and heating zones 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 controlled at nominal settings of 150 , 180 , 200 and 240 ° c ., respectively ( no . 4 is closest to the die ). equilibrium extrusion conditions were achieved after 120 min . the screw speed was then systematically varied from 1 rpm to 120 rpm to generate , as previously described , the correlation of extruder throughput and die pressure shown in curve 1 of fig2 . melt fracture was not observed at any screw speed tested , but die buildup ( collection of polymer at the exit of the capillary die ) was observed at screw speeds greater than 60 rpm . ( b ) without changing conditions the feed was changed to a powder blend of polystyrene containing 0 . 05 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymer 2g . using the procedure of part a , a new equilibrium was established after 240 min ., and the data of curve 2 in fig2 was generated . die buildup was not observed at any screw speed . ( c ) without changing conditions the extruder was thoroughly purged with hydrocarbon polymer a containing 20 wt . % of silica . then the procedure of part a was repeated except that the extruder feed was changed to a powder blend of polystyrene containing 0 . 05 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymer 1d . after a total extrusion time of 250 min ., conventional capillary rheometer curves were generated and the plot of fig2 curve 3 was obtained . no melt fracture or die buildup was observed . ( d ) the procedure of part c was repeated except that after purging the feed was changed to a powder blend of polystyrene containing 0 . 05 wt . % each of fluorocarbon polymers 1d and 2g . after a total extrusion time of 240 min . the data shown in fig2 curve 4 was obtained . no melt fracture or die buildup was observed . in a procedure like that of example 14 , except that the extruder heating zones numbers 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 were controlled at nominal temperature settings of 160 , 180 , 220 and 220 ° c ., respectively , the performance of an extrusion grade ethylene / vinyl acetate copolymer elvax ®- 3135 ( du pont co . ), density 0 . 930 g / cc , melt index of 0 . 35 g / 10 min ., was evaluated . curve 1 of fig3 shows data for extrusion of unmodified eva copolymer . curve 2 shows data for a blend containing 0 . 05 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymer 2g and curve 3 shows data for a blend containing 0 . 05 wt . % of fluorocarbon polymer 1d . curve 4 of the figure show the data for an eva containing 0 . 05 wt . % each of fluorocarbon polymers 1d and 2g . ( a ) in a procedure like that of example 14 , except that the extruder heating zones numbers 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 were controlled at nominal temperature settings of 280 , 310 , 310 and 310 ° c ., respectively , the performance of an extrusion grade copolymer of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid ( goodyear pet ), density 1 . 39 g / cc , inherent viscosity ( 0 . 05 wt . % in a 3 / 1 mixture of methylene chloride and trifluoroacetone ) 1 . 65 , was evaluated . die pressure was measured at a constant screw speed of 5 rpm over a period of 120 min . the die pressure fluctuated steadily between about 3 to 10 mpa with a time period of several minutes . after 120 minutes the screw speed was varied from 1 to 30 rpm . large die pressure fluctuations continued and at 30 rpm caused automatic shutoff of the extruder , which had a safety cutoff pressure set at 70 mpa . at 30 rpm flow rate was 19 . 8 g / min . thus , the pet could not be extruded at screw speeds greater than 30 rpm or at a flow rate greater than 19 . 8 g / min . in addition , an accumulation of dark decomposed polymer was observed to build up at the exit of the capillary die at all extrusion speeds . curve 1 of fig4 shows data for the extrusion of unmodified pet up to the point of automatic shutoff . pressure values are the averages of the high and low extremes .

"an embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the drawings . fig1 is a diagram showing a schematic structure of an image processing apparatus 10 according to a first embodiment , and fig2 is an explanatory diagram showing a raw file . in the image processing apparatus 10 , a cpu 12 for executing various calculating processings , an rom 14 for recording a program group to set hardware , an ram 16 for temporarily recording data when the cpu 12 executes various calculation processings , a clock generator 18 for generating an operation clock , a video board 20 including a display connector to which a display 40 is connected and an lan board 22 to which a network compatible printer 42 is connected through an lan cable are connected to an input / output controller 24 for performing a connection to various apparatuses and a control through a bus 26 . an input device 27 such as a keyboard or a mouse and a hard disk 28 having a large capacity are connected to the input / output controller 24 , and furthermore , a card type memory adaptor 32 capable of transferring data together with a card type memory 30 storing a raw file 50 ( see fig2 ) for an image photographed by means of a digital camera is connected thereto through a usb terminal . the hard disk 28 includes a program holder 28 a for storing various programs such as a jpeg file creating program for performing various corrections for raw data included in the raw file and creating a jpeg file . the raw file 50 will be described . the raw file 50 is created in a digital camera 60 when the digital camera 60 performs photographing , and can be stored in the card type memory 30 inserted in the digital camera 60 . the raw file 50 includes a header 52 for storing various information , raw data 54 to be unprocessed data in which an electric signal obtained from an electric charge generated by a light received by an image capturing unit ( for example , a ccd or a cmos ) of the digital camera 60 is converted into digital data , and thumbnail data 56 to be a reduced image obtained by developing the raw data 54 . the header 52 is a region having information about the numbers of longitudinal and horizontal pixels of the raw data 54 and a size of one pixel , for example . the raw data 54 have data on one of r , g and b per pixel . the case in which the image capturing unit is a color ccd will be taken as an example . in a color ccd 62 to be used for the digital camera 60 , generally , individual elements can identify separate colors from each other by covering a color filter for one of the three colors of r , g and b over the ccd . one r , one b and two gs are disposed in a window 62 a in two pixels by two pixels . for this reason , the raw data 54 have the data on one of r , g and b for each pixel . the raw data 54 usually have a high gradation representation of 8 to 16 bits for rgb and are subjected to a non - compression or a reversible compression in which the same state can be restored again even if a compression is performed . the thumbnail data 56 are obtained by developing the raw data 54 to have a predetermined pixel size ( for example , 160 × 120 ) in the digital camera 60 . therefore , color information about each pixel of the thumbnail data 56 depends on an image processing of the digital camera 60 performing photographing and an original region having an achromatic color is represented as the achromatic color . next , description will be given to an operation of the image processing apparatus 10 according to the embodiment which has such a structure , particularly , an operation to be performed in the execution of the jpeg file creating program . fig4 is a flowchart showing a jpeg file creating routine to be executed by the cpu 12 . the routine is stored in the program holder 28 a of the hdd 28 and is executed when a user gives a command for executing the jpeg file creating program from the input device 27 . when the routine is started , the cpu 12 first acquires the thumbnail data 56 and the raw data 54 from the raw file 50 stored in the card type memory 30 ( step s 100 ), and a pixel interpolation processing for the raw data 54 is performed ( step s 110 ). data on each pixel which are included in the raw data 54 are data on any one of r , g and b . therefore , a guess is given from colors of surrounding pixels per pixel , thereby complementing for colors other than the same pixels . since the processing of guessing a color is performed by connecting the same colors through a straight line or a curved line so as to be expressed , thus , it is referred to as a pixel interpolation processing . subsequently , the cpu 12 grasps a position of a pixel having an achromatic color of the thumbnail data 56 ( step s 120 ). more specifically , an absolute value (| r − g |) of a difference between r and g in values of r , g and b included in each pixel of the thumbnail data 56 and an absolute value (| b − g |) of a difference between b and g are calculated , and it is decided whether both of the absolute values are included in a predetermined small range ( which is smaller than three , for example ). when they are included in the small range , the pixel is set to have an achromatic color and a position of the pixel having the achromatic color is stored in the ram 16 . it is assumed that each of the values of r , g and b included in each pixel of the thumbnail data 56 is expressed in 256 gradations ( 8 bits ) of 0 to 255 corresponding to density . moreover , it is apparent that the values of r , g and b are almost equal to each other in the pixel having the achromatic color . in the case in which the respective differences between the values of r , g and b are included in the predetermined small range as described above , accordingly , it is assumed to decide that the pixel has the achromatic color as described above . when the absolute values of the differences between two sets of the values of r , g and b are included in the predetermined small range , similarly , the absolute value of the difference between a residual set of the values is necessarily included in a certain range . subsequently , the cpu 12 corresponds to a position of the pixel having the achromatic color of the thumbnail data 56 . a position of a pixel of the raw data 54 is calculated by a coordinate transformation ( step s 130 ). fig5 is a view for explaining the coordinate transformation . since the raw data 54 are digital data , they cannot be recognized as an image by human eyes . in fig5 , however , the raw data 54 are expressed in an image for convenience . an image of the thumbnail data 56 has a smaller size than the image of the raw data 54 . therefore , there is a plurality of pixels of the raw data 54 corresponding to the position of the pixel having the achromatic color of the thumbnail data 56 . in the embodiment , however , it is assumed that a central one of the pixels corresponds to the position of the pixel having the achromatic color of the thumbnail data 56 . then , σr , σg and σb are calculated by integrating the values of r , the values of g and the values of b respectively per pixel having the achromatic color of the raw data 54 which are obtained by the coordinate transformation ( step s 140 ), and white balance gains rc , gc and bc are calculated based on the values σr , σg and σb thus integrated ( step s 150 ). fig6 is an explanatory diagram related to the gains rc , gc and bc . at the step s 150 , the gain gc is set to have a value of 1 ( σg / σg ), the gain rc is set to be σg / σr and the gain bc is set to be σg / σb in such a manner that the values of r and b are coincident with the value of g on the basis of the value of g as shown in fig6 . then , the values of r , g and b of all the pixels of the raw data 54 are multiplied by the gains rc , gc and bc respectively , and the values obtained by the multiplication are set to be values of r , g and b obtained after the white balance correction processing ( step s 160 ). thereafter , there are performed a color correction processing of correcting a color corresponding to a human visual characteristic ( step s 170 ) and a gamma correction processing of correcting a change in a brightness for an input signal to be linear ( step s 180 ). thereafter , there is performed a jpeg compression for thinning color information with a low human sensitivity , dividing an image into small blocks and collecting colors , thereby reducing a file capacity ( step s 190 ), and a file name is given to a jpeg file obtained after the jpeg compression and the jpeg file is then stored in a predetermined region of the hdd ( step s 200 ), and the routine thus ends . according to the image processing apparatus 10 in accordance with the embodiment described above in detail , the white balance correction for the raw data 54 is performed by setting the thumbnail data 56 to be the developed data as an index . as compared with the case in which all of the rgb information about the respective pixels are read from the raw data 54 to perform the white balance correction , consequently , the correction processing can be performed more rapidly . in particular , the pixel having the achromatic color can be easily extracted from the thumbnail data 56 . by performing the white balance correction for the raw data 54 with the position of the pixel having the achromatic color set to be the index , therefore , it is possible to rapidly perform the correction processing . at this time , the pixel having the difference between the values of r , g and b included in a predetermined small range is set to be the pixel having the achromatic color in the thumbnail data 56 . therefore , it is possible to specify the position of the pixel having the achromatic color of the thumbnail data 56 with high precision . since a second embodiment is the same as the first embodiment except that a flowchart for a jpeg file creating routine is different , the same components have the same reference numerals and description thereof will be omitted . in the embodiment , a histogram representing a relationship between a gradation level and an appearance frequency ( the number of pixels ) in raw data 54 and a histogram representing a relationship between a gradation level and an appearance frequency in thumbnail data 56 are created for each of r , g and b , and the former shape is corrected to be coincident with the latter shape and a white balance correction for the raw data 54 is thus performed . fig7 shows an example of the flowchart illustrating the jpeg file creating routine employing the correction . when the routine is started , a cpu 12 first acquires the thumbnail data 56 and the raw data 54 from a raw file 50 stored in a card type memory 30 ( step s 300 ) and a pixel interpolation processing for the ram data 54 is performed ( step s 310 ). the pixel interpolation processing is the same as that in the step s 210 . subsequently , the cpu 12 creates a histogram for each of r , g and b of the thumbnail data 56 ( step s 320 ) and the same color correction processing ( step s 330 ) as that in the step s 170 is performed to the data obtained after the pixel interpolation processing for the raw data 54 , and a histogram for each channel of r , g and b of the data obtained after the color correction processing is then created ( step s 340 ). as shown in fig8 a and 8b , then , white balance gains rc , gc and bc are calculated in such a manner that a shape of the histogram for each channel of r , g and b created at the step s 340 is coincident with that of the histogram for each channel of r , g and b of the thumbnail data 56 ( step s 350 ). the shape of the histogram is corrected in such a manner that maximum gradation levels r_max , g_max and b_max of the histogram for each channel of r , g and b created at the step s 340 ( the maximum value of gradation levels with an appearance frequency of 1 or more ) is coincident with maximum gradation levels r_max , g_max and b_max of the histogram for each channel of r , g and b of the thumbnail data 56 . in that case , the white balance gains rc , gc and bc are calculated . subsequently , each channel for r , g and b of all pixels of the raw data 54 is multiplied by the gains rc , gc and bc respectively and the values obtained by the multiplication are set to be values for r , g and b obtained after the white balance correction processing ( step s 360 ). then , the same gamma correction processing ( step s 370 ) as the step s 180 and the same jpeg compression ( step s 380 ) as the step s 190 are performed , a file name is given to a jpeg file obtained after the jpeg compression and the jpeg file is stored in a predetermined region of an hdd ( step s 390 ), and the routine thus ends . according to the embodiment described above in detail , the white balance correction for the raw data 54 is performed by setting the thumbnail data 56 to be the developed data as an index . as compared with the case in which all of the rgb information about each pixel are read from the raw data 54 to perform the white balance correction , consequently , the correction processing can be performed more rapidly . in particular , it can be supposed that the thumbnail data 56 are subjected to the white balance correction for the raw data 54 by any processing method in a digital camera 60 . by simply adapting the shape of the histogram of the data obtained after performing the pixel interpolation and color correction to the raw data 54 to that of the histogram of the thumbnail data 56 , therefore , it is assumed that the white balance correction for the thumbnail data 56 is applied to the raw data 54 . consequently , it is possible to perform the white balance for the raw data 54 rapidly . it is apparent that the invention is not restricted to the embodiments but the invention can be executed in various modes without departing from the technical range thereof . while the white balance correction is performed after the execution of the pixel interpolation processing for the raw data 54 in the first and second embodiments , for example , it may be performed before the execution of the pixel interpolation processing . although the thumbnail data are utilized as the developed data in the first and second embodiments , it is possible to utilize , without a particular restriction , any data to be developed and stored simultaneously when storing the raw data on an image photographed by the digital camera 60 . for example , it is also possible to employ screen nail data as the developed data . here , the screen nail data are , for example , embedded image data for displaying . while it is not decided whether the pixel corresponding to the pixel having the achromatic color in the thumbnail data 56 of the raw data 54 is actually the pixel having the achromatic color or not in the first embodiment , it may be decided whether the pixel corresponding to the pixel having the achromatic color in the thumbnail data 56 of the raw data 54 is actually the pixel having the achromatic color or not and the white balance correction for the raw data 54 may be performed based on the value of each channel of r , g and b of the pixel . although the absolute value (| r − g |) of the difference between r and g and the absolute value ( b − g |) of the difference between b and g in the values of r , g and b included in each pixel of the thumbnail data 56 are calculated and it is decided whether both of the absolute values are included in the predetermined small range ( which is smaller than three , for example ) or not in order to grasp the position of the pixel having the achromatic color of the thumbnail data 56 at the s 120 in the first embodiment , a ratio ( r / g ) of r to g and a ratio ( b / g ) of b to g may be calculated to decide whether both of the ratios are included in a vicinal region of a value of “ 1 ” ( for example , 0 . 99 to 1 . 01 ) or not , and the pixel may be decided to have the achromatic color if they are included in the same region . while the raw data 54 are corrected in such a manner that the maximum gradation levels r_max , g_max and b_max of the histogram of the data obtained by performing the pixel interpolation and color correction over the raw data 54 are coincident with the maximum gradation levels r_max , g_max and b_max of the histogram in the thumbnail data 56 in the second embodiment , a mean value of the gradation level having an appearance frequency of 1 or more in the histogram may be used in place of the maximum gradation level or a value with which the appearance frequency of the histogram has a predetermined number ( for example , 50 % as a whole ), that is , a median may be used . in any case , it is possible to rapidly perform the white balance correction for the raw data 54 . in the second embodiment , it is also possible to compare a sum of the absolute values of the differences between both of the histograms ( the differences in the appearance frequency for the respective gradation levels ) obtained after the execution of the correction for causing the maximum gradation levels to be coincident with each other , a sum of the absolute values of the differences between both of the histograms obtained after the execution of the correction for causing the mean values to be coincident with each other and a sum of the absolute values of the differences between both of the histograms obtained after the execution of the correction for causing the medians to be coincident with each other , and to employ a correction processing in which the sum is a minimum as described above in order to correct the shape of the histogram of the data obtained after the execution of the pixel interpolation and color correction for the raw data 54 to be coincident with that of the histogram of the thumbnail data 56 . in the case in which the sum of the absolute values of the differences between both of the histograms obtained after the execution of each correction is the minimum , thus , it is possible to regard the shapes of both of the histograms to be the closest . therefore , it is preferable to employ the correction processing . the present disclosure relates to the subject matter contained in japanese patent application no . 2005 - 313056 ( filed on oct . 27 , 2005 ), which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirely .",7
"in the following , the invention will be described with the assumption that data to be recovered are stored in data pages in an information carrier such as that depicted in fig4 . since this information carrier contains data arranged in a matrix , the macro - cells also contain elementary data arranged in a matrix . referring to fig5 of the drawings , there is illustrated schematically a rectangular probe array comprising a matrix of light spots 102 . this probe array can be scanned across the data layer of the information carrier ( not shown ) in the direction indicated by the arrow a . it will be appreciated that such scanning may be achieved by movement of the light spots 102 relative to the information carrier or by means of movement of the information carrier relative to the light spots . as shown , the scanning direction a is non - parallel to the matrix defining the probe array . the size of each probe or light spot 102 in the arrangement of fig1 is one third of the pitch p of the probe array and the scanning direction a in the arrangement of fig1 is optimally chosen in such a way that , when the array is scanned over 3 pitches ( 3p ), the displaced array overlaps the original position of the array . when the array is scanned in steps equal to the diameter d of the light spots 102 , over 3 * 3 − 1 = 8 steps , the situation illustrated in fig6 occurs , wherein the light spots denoted 102 a indicate the initial position of the probe array and the light spots denoted 102 b . . . 102 i indicate the respective positions of the probe array for each scanning step . it is clear from this that scanning the array over 3 * 3 − 1 = 8 steps results in having read all the data on the card . it will be clear from fig6 that , in order to read all of the data on the data card using the one - dimensional scanning process of the present invention , the probe array needs to be larger than the area of the data layer to be read ( note that the upper two rows of the probe array illustrated in fig6 are not completely filled ). when the multiplexing factor m is defined as the ratio of array pitch p to probe size d , it can be seen that m − 1 rows are not completely filled during the scanning process , and m 2 − 1 steps are required to fill the whole surface of the data layer , whereas using the two - dimensional scanning process of the prior art , m − 1 steps in both directions would be required . thus , the stroke of the one - dimensional scanning apparatus used in the system of the present invention is : the one - dimensional scanning principle employed in the present invention can also be used in respect of larger data density applications , such as that used in the so - called two - dimensional optical storage ( twodos ) approach , aiming at demonstrating the feasibility of real - time , robust readout of a single layer disc with a capacity of at least 50 gb and at a data rate of more than 360 mbit / s . spacing between tracks on an optical information carrier limits attainable storage capacity , while the serial nature of the data in a one - dimensional optical storage system limits the attainable data throughput . as a result , the concept of twodos has been developed which is based on innovative two - dimensional channel coding and advanced signal processing , in combination with a read - channel consisting of a multi - spot light path realizing a parallel read - out . referring to fig7 of the drawings , in a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention suitable for use in larger data density applications , the probe array has been effectively rotated about a generally central z axis , such that the rows and columns of light spots 102 are effectively at an angle to the x and y axes respectively , and the scanning direction , indicated by the arrow b , is parallel to the y axis . the data area 105 is also shown and it can be seen that , in addition to the main advantage of the present invention whereby a one - dimensional scanner can be used instead of a two - dimensional scanner , because the number of probes 102 has been increased relative to that in the array of fig1 and 2 , the required scanning stroke in this case is much smaller than m − 1 . the effect of cross - talk between two neighbouring data bits can be reduced using the twodos approach ( since inter - symbol interference , which is considered to be noise in the case of one - dimensional storage , is considered to be part of the signal in the 2d case and , as such is used in the respective bit pattern reconstruction ) and by means of a system wherein read data pages can be stored in a buffer memory and subsequently recovered using dedicated data recovering algorithms in the digital processing domain . in this case , an additional advantage of the scanning system of fig7 is that the capacity of the buffer memory required for cross - talk cancellation is reduced , thereby contributing to define a cost - effective system . it will be appreciated that the angle of the rows and columns of light spots relative to the x and y axes in the embodiment illustrated in fig7 can be varied , as can the pitch of the light spots on the lines . in all cases , the probe array can be produced using the known diffraction phenomena referred to as “ talbot effect ”, whereby when a coherent input light beam is applied to an object having a periodic diffractive structure ( thus forming light emitters ), such as an array of apertures , the diffracted lights recombine into identical images of the emitters at a plane located at a predictable distance ( z 0 ), i . e . the talbot distance , from the diffracting structure . thus , the present invention provides a system for reading an information carrier ( or “ data card ”), whereby a one - dimensional scanner can be used to read out the full area of the data card , such that the resultant reader becomes less complex relative to prior art systems in which a two - dimensional scanner is used . as illustrated in fig8 , the system and method according to the invention may advantageously be implemented in a reading apparatus ra ( e . g . home player apparatus . . . ), a portable device pd ( e . g . portable digital assistant , portable computer , a game player unit . . . ), a mobile telephone mt . each of these devices comprises an opening ( op ) intended to receive an information carrier 701 as depicted in fig4 , in view of a data recovery . the scanning system in accordance with the invention may be used in a microscope . microscopes with reasonable resolution are expensive , since an aberration - free objective lens with a reasonably large field of view and high enough numerical aperture is costly . scanning microscopes solve this cost issue partly by having an objective lens with a very small field of view , and scanning the objective lens with respect to the sample to be measured ( or vice - versa ). the disadvantage of this single - spot scanning microscope is the fact that the whole sample has to be scanned , resulting in cumbersome mechanics . multi - spot scanning microscopes solve this mechanical problem , since the sample does not have to be scanned over its full dimensions , the scanning range is limited to the pitch between two spots . in a microscope in accordance with the invention , a sample is illuminated with the spots that are created by the probe array generating means , and a camera takes a picture of the illuminated sample . by scanning the spots over the sample by means of the one -

"in the discussion which follows , it is important to distinguish between graphite “ foams ” and “ solid , porous graphite materials .” a “ foam ” will be defined herein to be a material having a relative density ( rd ) equal to or less than 0 . 3 , i . e ., being at least 70 % porous . using this definition , the artifacts prepared according to the method of the present invention have apparent densities greater than about 0 . 678 g / cc , relative densities greater than 0 . 3 and thus constitute “ porous solids ” rather than foams . at a relative density ( rd ) above about 0 . 3 , there is a transition from a cellular structure ( foam ) to one which is better thought of as a solid containing isolated pores ( porous solid ). rd can be defined as : see : “ cellular solids , structure and properties , second edition , page 2 , lorna j . gibson , dept . of materials science and engineering , mit , cambridge , mass . 021139 , usa , michael f . ashby , dept . of engineering , cambridge , university , cambridge , uk , cambridge university press , 40 w . 20 th street , new york , n . y ., 1988 . for example , a graphite foam with an apparent density of 0 . 50 g / cc would have a rd = 0 . 50 / 2 . 26 = 0 . 22 ( where 0 . 5 g / cc is the density of the cellular material and 2 . 26 g / cc is the density of the graphite in the cell walls ). a sample with an apparent density of 0 . 678 g / cc would have a rd = 0 . 678 / 2 . 26 = 0 . 3 , therefore any material produced that has an apparent density greater than 0 . 678 g / cc will be a “ solid ” containing isolated pores according to the above definition . in the discussion of the invention which follows , reference will be made to both foams and solids , it being understood that the present invention is directed toward porous solids . one problem with previously produced “ foamed ” products was the presence of density variations from the top to the bottom of the production billet . the density variations in the end products were found to occur between the foaming and solidification steps of the prior art process while the foamed pitch was still in the liquid state . the liquid pitch tends to migrate due to gravity , thereby making the bottom of the production billet denser than the top portion of the billet . applicant &# 39 ; s previous application ser . no . 09 / 862 , 560 , concerned the discovery that , by heating the pitch under an increased pressure above 1000 psig , the process temperature can exceed the normal foaming point of the pitch without the pitch actually foaming , i . e ., the thermal foaming point is raised . holding the pitch at such a selected temperature allows the growth of mesophase domains within the pitch , thereby increasing the pitch &# 39 ; s viscosity . higher viscosities at this point in the process reduce the previously described migration problems . the present invention concerns the discovery that the apparent density of artifacts of the above type can be manipulated to produce “ solid ” graphites by processing at final pressures greater than 1000 psi and manipulating the final “ boiling pressure ”. as a result of the higher and variable processing pressures , the apparent densities of the end products have been increased to greater than 0 . 678 g / cc with thermal conductivities which exceed 150 w / mk . [ 0033 ] fig1 shows a graph of thermal conductivity in w / mk versus apparent density in g / cc for several of the poco specialty graphites as compared to the solid , high thermally conductive porous graphite ( htcpg ) of the invention . the thermal conductivity of the sample htcpg in fig1 exceeds 250 w / mk . in the process of the invention , a solid , porous graphite is produced by first placing pitch powder , granules or pellets into a mold or container with the desired final shape of the artifact to be produced . the pitch can be selected from among the mesophase pitches , isotropic pitches and mixtures thereof . the mesophase pitches include , for example , synthetic pitches , coal based pitches and petroleum based pitches . these pitch materials can be solvated if desired . the pitches can be introduced in the granulated , powdered or pelletized form . one example precursor material is the mitsubishi ara - 24 mesophase pitch . a proper mold release agent or film can be applied to the sides of the mold to allow removal of the part . preferably , a suitable liner , such as an aluminum foil liner is utilized . if the mold is made from pure aluminum , typically no mold release agent is necessary since the molten pitch does not wet the aluminum and thus does not stick to the mold . the pitch may be desiccated to assist in removing any residual moisture . following desiccation , the pitch is processed in a substantially oxygen - free environment to avoid oxidation of the pitch materials during heating . preferably , the pitch is placed in a “ hip ” furnace which has been evacuated to less than two torr . the hip vessel is pressurized to a high initial pressure , e . g ., 8000 psig , which increases the boiling point higher than the boiling point at the final processing pressure . the pitch is then heated to a temperature approximately 50 to 100 ° c . above the softening point . for example , where mitsubishi ara - 24 mesophase pitch is used , a temperature of 300 ° c . is sufficient . after holding the pitch at 300 ° c . for one hour , the pitch is heated from 300 to 450 ° c . and held at 450 ° c . for a predetermined amount of time to increase the viscosity of the liquid pitch . the vessel is then depressurized from the initial processing pressure ( 8000 psig ) to the final processing pressure , e . g ., 2000 psig , while maintaining the temperature of the initial processing pressure . this depressurizing causes the liquid pitch to boil and generate porosity . as will be explained in greater detail in the examples which follow , the boiling liquid is then heated to a temperature , e . g ., 500 ° c ., that solidifies the artifact in one or more steps . the temperature of the system can then be raised from 500 ° c . to 600 ° c ., or to a temperature sufficient to coke the pitch ( about 500 - 600 ° c .). this is performed at a rate no greater than about 5 ° c ./ min and preferably about 1 ° c ./ min . the final temperature is held at 600 ° c . for about 2 hours and then the furnace power is turned off and cooled to room temperature . during the cooling cycle , pressure is released gradually to atmospheric conditions . any remaining pressure is released at a rate of about 30 psi per minute . the artifact is then separated from the mold . the artifact can be post heat treated to temperatures above 2000 ° c . for conversion to graphitic structure , depending upon the pitch precursor . in general , mesophase pitch is graphitized significantly easier than isotropic pitches ( coal derived or petroleum derived ). the more graphitic the material , the higher the thermal conductivity of the resulting graphitic foam . the specific steps followed in the process of the invention are summarized below : 1 . a mold is filled with a pellet or powder form of mesophase pitch . 2 . the pitch is then desiccated to assist in removing any residual moisture . 3 . the pitch is placed into a hot isostatic press ( hip ). 5 . the pitch is pressurized to a high initial processing pressure , which increases the boiling point higher than the boiling point at the final processing pressure . 6 . the pitch is heated to a temperature below the solidification point but above the liquid and boiling point which typically occurs if processed at the final processing pressure . 7 . the pitch is depressurized from the initial processing pressure to the final processing pressure while maintaining the temperature which is above the pitch boiling point at the final processing pressure , thus producing a porous artifact . 8 . the artifact is heated to a temperature that solidifies and cokes the porous artifact . 9 . the artifact is cooled to room temperature while allowing natural depressurization during cooling . 10 . the artifact is depressurized of any remaining pressure to atmospheric pressure . 12 . the artifact is then heat - treated to a sufficient temperature to completely carbonize the artifact . 13 . the artifact is then heat - treated to a sufficient temperature to graphitize the artifact . the process of the invention heats the pitch under an “ increased pressure ” which , in effect increases the thermal boiling point . that is , the process temperatures can exceed the “ normal ” boiling point of the pitch without the pitch actually boiling . in the first example which follows , the hip was pressurized to 8000 psi as the “ initial processing pressure .” this increased pressure will be understood to be an arbitrary number which could be anywhere in the range from about 4000 to 30 , 000 psig . in other words , assuming that a doubling of pressure generally increases boiling point by about 10 ° c ., one could roughly estimate the boiling temperature of the pitch to be affected as follows : 1000 psi 425 ° c . 2000 psi 435 ° c . 4000 psi 445 ° c . 8000 psi 455 ° c . based upon this theoretical analysis , 8000 psi was selected as an acceptable “ initial processing pressure ” to achieve the desired pressurization induced boiling effect . the final processing pressure is also an arbitrary number which is generally in the range from about 1000 and 30 , 000 psig . as will be evident from the examples which follow the final processing pressure affects both the ultimate thermal conductivity and apparent density of the finished artifact . by employing final processing pressures which are greater than about 1000 psig , apparent densities are increased above 0 . 70 g / cc and thermal conductivities exceed 250 w / mk . the following examples are intended to be illustrative of the process steps of the invention without being limiting : 1 . the mold is filled with a predetermined amount of pitch to give an appropriate foam height . 3 . the hip vessel is evacuated to & lt ; 2 torr with the vacuum being held for 15 minutes . 4 . the vessel is pressurized to 8000 psig with nitrogen gas . 5 . the pitch is heated from room temperature to 300 ° c . at a rate of 3 . 5 ° c . per minute . 6 . the pitch is held at 300 ° c . for 1 hour . 7 . the pitch is heated from 300 to 450 ° c . at a rate of 2 . 0 ° c . per minute . 8 . the pitch is held at 450 ° c . for 1 hour . ( this increases the viscosity of the liquid pitch ). 9 . the vessel is depressurized from 8000 to 2000 psig at a rate of 175 psi per minute while maintaining a temperature of 450 ° c . ( at this stage , the liquid pitch begins to boil and generate porosity .) 10 . the artifact is heated from 450 to 475 ° c . at a rate of 2 . 0 ° c . per minute . 11 . the artifact is held at 475 ° c . for 1 hour . ( this is the point at which the artifact begins to set ). 12 . the artifact is heated from 475 to 500 ° c . at a rate of 0 . 5 ° c . per minute . 13 . the artifact is held at 500 ° c . for 30 minutes . ( at this point , the artifact fully solidifies ). 14 . the artifact is heated from 500 to 600 ° c . at a rate of 1 . 0 ° c . per minute . ( this is the stage at which the artifact begins to coke .) 15 . the artifact is held at 600 ° c . for 2 hours . 16 . the artifact is cooled from 600 ° c . to room temperature at a rate of 2 . 0 ° c . per minute . 17 . the vessel naturally depressurizes during cooldown from 600 ° c . to room temperature . 18 . the remaining vessel pressure is released at a rate approximately 30 psi per minute . 19 . the artifact is removed from the hip and its mold . 20 . the artifact is then heat treated to approximately 1000 ° c . for carbonization . 21 . the artifact is then heat treated to approximately 2800 ° c . for graphitization . results : thermal conductivity ranged from 131 - 207 w / mk . apparent density ranged from 0 . 70 - 0 . 74 g / cc . 9 . the vessel is depressurized from 8000 psi to 3000 psi at a rate of 175 psi per minute while maintaining a temperature of 450 ° c . results : thermal conductivity ranged from 180 - 247 w / mk . apparent density ranged from 0 . 84 - 0 . 85 g / cc . 9 . the vessel pressure is held at 8000 psig while maintaining a temperature of 450 ° c . 8 . the pitch is held at 450 ° c . for 1 . 5 hours . 9 . the vessel is depressurized from 8000 psig to 2800 psig at a rate of 260 psi per minute while maintaining a temperature of 450 ° c . an invention has been provided with several advantages . the process of the invention results in solid , high thermally conductive porous graphites having more uniform density gradient properties . the increased viscosity of the pitch during the processing operation reduces pore / bubble sizes within the ultimate porous artifact . manipulation of the final process temperature allows greater control over pore size . additionally , changing the hold times and temperature along with the various upper and lower pressure limits allows the production of a wider variety of porous graphite products . the porous solid graphites of the invention exhibit thermal conductivities which exceed 70 w / mk , and generally range from about 90 - 300 w / mk with apparent densities ranging from about 0 . 678 g / cc - 1 . 5 g / cc . while the invention has been shown in only one of its forms , it is not thus limited , but is susceptible to various changes and modifications without departing the sprit thereof .",2

24 and to operate the actuator 17 through a pilot valve 34 . the rotary actuator 17 includes a rotatable shaft 17a which is coupled to a plurality of rotatable shafts 18a - 24a of the valve sections 18 - 24 . when a hydraulic pilot line 35 is unpressurized the pilot valve 34 is in the position shown in fig1 wherein upper chamber 17b of the actuator 17 is connected to the vent 29 through the valve section a , whereby the actuator shaft 17a and the valve sections 18 - 24 remain in a stationary position . when pressure is admitted to the hydraulic pilot line 35 the spool of the valve 34 shifts so that liquid from the hydraulic supply line 28 is coupled through the section b of the pilot valve 34 to the upper chamber 17b , causing the actuator 17 to rotate the valve sections 18 - 24 to another distinct position . when the valves 18 - 24 are in the positions shown in fig1 hydraulic pressure from the hydraulic supply line 28 is coupled through portion a of valve 19 through a hydraulic line 25b to a production wing valve 36 , causing the wing valve to open . hydraulic fluid coupled through portion a of valve 20 and portion a of valve 23 through hydraulic lines 25c , 25f also causes a downhole safety valve 37 and a crossover valve 41 to open . an upper master valve 42 and a lower master valve 43 are connected to vent 29 through hydraulic line 25a and the portion a of valve 18 , and an annulus master valve 47 and an annulus wing valve 48 are connected to the vent 29 by lines 25d , 25e through the portions a of valve section 21 and 22 , respectively . the lowermost valve 24 and a plurality of pressure relief valves 51 - 56 provide a predetermined upper value of pressure on the pilot line 35 at the control center to indicate the position of the valve 24 , thereby also indicating the position of the rotary actuator 17 and of the other valve 18 - 23 . for example , when all the valves are in their a positions , the pressure relief valve 51 is connected through the portion a of valve 24 to the pilot line 35 and limits the maximum pressure on the pilot line to 1000 psi . when the valves are all in their b positions the pressure relief valve 52 limits the pressure on the pilot line 35 to 1400 psi , thereby indicating that the valves and the actuator are in said b positions . fig1 and 15 disclose other embodiments of circuits for interconnecting the actuator pilot valve 34 , the actuator 17 and the valve sections . in fig1 the position signal line 35a is connected to the supply line 28 through the portion b of the pilot valve 34 so that the pressure on line 28 can be used to determine the rotary position of the valve sections 18 -

24 are individually removable units which can be stacked in an end - to - end manner as shown in fig2 with the shaft 17a of the actuator 17 connected to the shaft 18a of the uppermost valve section 18 , and with each of the other valve sections having a shaft connected to the shaft of the valve section positioned immediately above it . each of the valve sections includes a body 60 ( fig3 ) having a generally cylindrical chamber 61 , with a generally disc shaped rotor 62 mounted therein and a cover 63 connected to the body 60 by a plurality of cap screws 67 . the rotor 62 is rotatably mounted in the chamber 61 by the shaft 18a which is pressed into a bore 69 in the rotor ( fig3 ). the rotor is connected to the shaft and retained in any one of six positions ( fig6 ) thereon by a key 70 ( fig3 ) which resides partially in a slot 74 in the shaft , and partially in any one of the six slots 75 in the rotor 62 . one end of the shaft 18a includes a female slot 76 ( fig5 ), and the other shaft end includes a mating male projection 79 ( fig4 ). when the valve sections are stacked , the male projection 79 on the upper end of one shaft fits into the female slot 76 on the lower end of an adjacent valve section to interconnect the sections for unitary rotation of their shafts and rotors . a plurality of ball or other suitable bearings 80 , mounted between the rotor 62 , the body and the cover 63 , relieve strain at the connection between the shaft and the rotor . the valve section ( fig3 ) includes a right angle pressure port 81 and a vent port 82 drilled radially in the body , and a right angle outlet port 86 in the cover 63 . a pair of shear seals 87a , 87b are mounted in an enlarged portion 81a , 86a of the ports 81 , 86 to provide a fluid -

through and right angle holes for the rotors of each of the valve sections . for example , to control the subsea tree 12 of fig1 the sequence of operation shown in the matrix of fig1 may be used . in the shut - in position , with the supply line 28 and the pilot line 35 unpressurized , the crossover valve 41 ( fig1 ) is open , as represented by the letter o ( fig1 ), and all the other valves are closed , as represented by the letter c . in the example shown in fig1 , the valves 42 , 43 are closed in steps 0 , 1 and 3 , and are open in steps 2 and 4 - 6 . this requires a rotor with the pattern of straight - through and angular holes shown in type no . 11 of fig8 b , and with the rotor starting in the f position in order to provide pressure to the valves 42 , 43 in steps 2 and 4 - 6 . this can be done by positioning and locking the rotor 62 on the shaft 18a ( fig3 ), with the right angle hole f at the shaft &# 39 ; s no . 1 position . a type 10 valve rotor ( fig8 b ) with the right angle hole e at the no . 1 shaft position , is required to control the valve 36 . proper positioning of the twelve rotor types of fig8 a and 8b with respect to the actuator drive shaft facilitates operation of the tree 12 in a six -

162e of the outer cam 161 which are angled counterclockwise as they extend downward . a torsion spring 182 ( fig9 ) is connected between the shaft 17a and the inner cam 176 to bias a radial outward cam lug 186 ( fig1 , 12 ) toward a radial inward shaft lug 187 . the actuator shaft 17a is normally retained in one of six rotary positions by the detent 123 ( fig9 ) extending into one of a plurality of shallow bores 188 in the lower portion 17c of the shaft 17a . as stated above , the number of rotary positions of the shaft and of the valve sections can be changed to a greater or lesser number as required . when the fluid chamber 112 ( fig9 ) is unpressurized the plunger 137 is biased to the upper end of the housing 105 with the pin 143 slightly above the upper end 161a of the outer cam 161 , and with one end of the pin 143 ( fig1 ) radially above the open end of one of the outer cam slots 162a - 162e and the other end of the pin 143 radially above the open end of one of the inner cam slots 180a - 180f . when the pin or cam follower 143 ( fig1 ) is positioned radially outward with the outward end 143a immediately above the open end of one of the outer cam slots 162a - 162e , the detent 150 is positioned in the groove 144 to retain the pin in the outer cam slot . when pressurized fluid is admitted through the port 113 to the fluid chamber 112 , the plunger 137 ( fig9 ) is moved axially downward forcing the pin 143 downward in the adjacent slot , with the pin moving along the radially extending line a ( fig1 ), as the plunger is prevented from rotating by the key 155 in the slot 156 ( fig9 ). for example , when the pin 143 moves down into the slot 162e , the pin 143 progresses downward along the line a until it reaches the lower end 162e &# 39 ; of the slot causing the outer cam 161 to rotate 60 degrees clockwise ( as viewed from above the actuator ). clockwise rotation of the cam 161 and the cam lug 174 causes the shaft lug 175 ( fig1 ) and the shaft 17a to rotate 60 degrees clockwise and for the detent 123 to move from bore 188a ( fig1 ) into the adjacent detent bore 188b . when pressure is released from the chamber 112 ( fig9 ) the plunger 137 is forced upward by the coil spring 157 , moving the pin 143 ( fig1 ) upward along the line a , in the slot 162e and rotating the outer cam 60 degrees counterclockwise . the shaft 17a is prevented from rotating by the detent 123 in the bore 188b and the cam lug 174 ( fig1 ) is rotated counter clockwise away from shaft lug 175 . the counterclockwise rotation of the outer cam 161 &# 34 ; winds &# 34 ; the torsion spring 182 ( fig9 ) to bias the outer cam lug 174 more strongly toward the shaft lug 175 . when the pin 143 moves out of the open end of the slot 162e the spring 170 causes the cam 161 to quickly rotate 60 degrees clockwise , with the upper end of the cam slot 162f stopping adjacent the pin 143 , as the outer cam lug 174 contacts the shaft lug 175 . this same sequence is repeated each time the plunger moves down and returns to the upper position , with the outer cam and shaft rotating 60 degrees clockwise as the pin 143 moves down to the bottom of a cam slot , the shaft is stopped and held in place by the detent 123 while the pin moves upward , rotates the outer cam counterclockwise and winds up the tension spring . when the pin 143 moves above the outer cam the cam snaps around clockwise with the pin adjacent another open end of another slot . this causes the shaft to rotate in increments between six distinct stopping points . when the pin 143 reaches the lower end of the last cam slot 162f the radial outer end of the pin is pressed against a bevelled surface 192 ( fig9 ) causing the pin 143 to move radially inward with the end 143b of the pin in the lower end 180a &# 39 ; of the cam slot 180a in the inner cam 176 . the detent 150 moves into the groove 145 of the pin to retain the pin in the slot 180a as the pin 143 and the plunger 137 move upward . each time the plunger moves downward the pin 143 moves downward in one of the inner cam slots 180a - 180f , with the pin moving along a line parallel to line a ( fig1 ) causing the inner cam 176 to rotate counterclockwise 60 degrees . the radial outward lug 186 on the inner cam 176 presses against the radial inward lug 187 on the shaft 17a ( fig1 ) causing the shaft to rotate counterclockwise and to move the detent 123 ( fig1 ) into an adjacent bore 188a - 188 f ( only part of which are shown ) on the shaft 17a . an upward movement of the plunger 137 and the pin 143 causes the inner cam 176 ( fig1 ) to rotate clockwise to move the lug 186 away from the lug 187 and &# 34 ; wind &# 34 ; the torsion spring 170 ( fig1 , 12 ) to bias the inner cam lug 186 more strongly toward the shaft lug 187 . when the pin 143 moves upward , out of the open end of one of the slots 180a - 180f , the torsion spring 182 causes the cam 176 to quickly rotate 60 degrees counterclockwise with the upper end of the next cam slot stopping adjacent the pin 143 , as the inner cam lug 186 contacts the shaft lug 187 . repeating the sequence causes the shaft 17a to rotate counterclockwise in increments between each of six distinct stopping points . when the pin 143 reaches the lower end of the last cam slot 180f ( fig9 ) the radial inner end 143b of the pin is pressed against a bevelled surface 193 causing the pin 143 to move radially outward into the lower end of the cam slot 162a and to again reverse the direction of rotation of the actuator shaft whenever the plunger 137 is moved downward . the shaft rotates through six positions in one direction , then automatically reverses the direction of rotation , and moves in reverse order through the same six positions . this process is automatically repeated as long as the plunger moves down and back up . the actuator 17 is connected to the stacked valve sections 18 - 24 by a spring loaded coupling means 194 ( fig2 , 9 ) comprising a generally cylindrical coupler 198 having an axial bore 199 extending downward through a portion of the coupler . a radial flange portion 200 includes an annular groove 201 ( fig3 ) with one end of a compression spring 205 mounted in the groove 201 and the other end of the spring connected to an annular groove 206 in the nut 132 ( fig9 ) to bias the coupler 198 toward the valve section 18 ( fig2 ). the coupler 198 is secured to the lower end 17c of the actuator shaft 17a ( fig9 ) by a set screw 207 mounted in a radial threaded hole 211 in the coupler and with the radial inner end of the set screw extending into an axial slot 212 in the shaft 17a . the slot 212 and set screw 207 allow the coupler 198 to travel axially along the shaft 17a through a distance determined by the vertical length of the slot 212 . the lower end of the coupler includes a shaft 213 ( fig3 ) having a radial slot 213a to receive the rectangular projection 79 on the upper end of the valve shaft 68 ( fig3 ) and to secure the shaft 18a of the upper valve section 18 to the shafts 213 and 17a . a slot 217 in the upper portion of the coupler 198 and a slot 218 in the lower end of the actuator shaft 17a ( fig9 ) contain a key 219 which couple rotational motion from the shaft 17a to the coupler 198 . the purpose of the coupling means 194 is to couple the actuator shaft 17a to the shaft 18a of the valve sections 18 - 24 during normal operation of the actuator 17 . if the actuator should fail , the coupler 198 ( fig2 ) can be pried upward from the valve section 18 by an appropriate tool until the shaft 213 ( fig3 ) of the coupler is disconnected from the shaft 18a of the upper valve section . a nut 223 ( fig2 ) extending from the lower end of the valve 24 and connected to the valve shaft 24a can be turned by an appropriate wrench to rotate the shaft 24a and temporarily operate the valves 18 - 24 . another embodiment 218 of the valve sections 18 - 24 ( fig2 ) is disclosed in fig1 with most of the elements functioning in a manner similar to the embodiment shown in fig3 - 6 . however , a rotor 262 and a shaft 268 are fixed together and the rotor cannot be removed and positioned in a different rotary position on the shaft as in the valve section of fig3 . the rotor 262 is supported by the shaft 268 which rotates in a bore 269 in the valve body 260 and in a bore 270 in a cover 263 . the upper end of the shaft 262 includes a square hole 270 and a square shaft end 271 on the other end . several of the valve sections 218 can be stacked with the square end 271 of one valve shaft fitting into the square hole 270 in the shaft of an adjacent valve section . these stacked valve sections 218 can be connected to a single actuator as shown in fig2 but individual sections cannot be removed or replaced without disconnecting the sections mounted below the section being removed . the present invention discloses apparatus for remote control of a relatively large number of hydraulically - operated subsea operators using only two hydraulic lines between a surface control center and a subsea device containing the operators . a valve actuator having a rotatable shaft or other output member which is movable to a plurality of distinct operating positions is coupled to a plurality of valves which are used to control the subsea operators . the valve actuator includes means for automatically reversing the direction of movement , so the valve is moved in a first direction through a sequence of distinct positions and then moved in a reverse direction through the same distinct positions . although the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention has been herein shown and described , it will be apparent that modification and variation may be made without departing from what is regarded to be the subject matter of the invention as defined in the appended claims .",8
"detecting / diagnosing : the terms detecting and diagnosing a rhythm disorder are used interchangeably in this application . activation time : for a given heart signal , this is the time of activation onset . activation time duration : for the signal of a given heartbeat , the time period and the signal waveform between the times of activation onset and offset . diastolic interval is the time period from activation offset of the prior beat to activation onset of the present beat ( fig5 ). activation trail : this is the ordering of the activation time onset at the sensor locations to create a discernible signature pattern , for example , including without limitation a rotational pattern around a core region indicative of a rotor , a radially emanating pattern from a core region , indicative of a focal beat cause , or a dispersed pattern , requiring further signal sampling and repeating of above analysis steps . identify and locate : the process of discerning the presence of a localized or dispersed cause of the heart rhythm disorder , then locating said cause relative to sensor locations or relative to known anatomic positions in the heart . heart rhythm disorder : an abnormal rhythm , often requiring treatment . these include without limitation , rapid rhythms of the top chambers of the heart ( atria ) such as rapid and abnormal activation of the normal sinus node ( inappropriate sinus tachycardia or sinus node reentry ), atrial tachycardia ( at ), supraventricular tachycardia ( svt ), atrial flutter ( afl ), premature atrial complexes / beats ( pac ) and the complex rhythms of atrial fibrillation ( af ) and certain forms of atypical atrial flutter . rapid rhythms can also occur in the bottom chambers of the heart ( ventricles ), including such as ventricular tachycardia ( vt ), ventricular fibrillation ( vf ), torsades de pointes and premature ventricular complexes / beats ( pvc ). heart rhythm disorders can also be slow , including sinus bradycardia , ectopic atrial bradycardia junctional bradycardia , atrioventricular block and idioventricular rhythm . cause of biological or heart rhythm disorder : this term is used interchangeably with “ source ” of the biological or heart rhythm disorder in this application . it refers to , without limitation , a rotational pattern of activation sequence around a core region indicative of a rotor , a radially emanating pattern from a core region indicative of a focal beat cause , or a dispersed pattern . in this invention , when a dispersed cause is found , signal sampling is extended to additional multiple locations and the detection and analysis steps of the invention are repeated . these causes are directly responsible for the perpetuation of the heart rhythm disorder . sensor : this term is used interchangeably with electrode in this application . it refers to an apparatus for detecting and transmitting signals from the heart or to the heart . prior to the discovery of the present invention , the causes of human biological rhythm disorders , and particularly heart rhythm disorders , had not been identified . the present invention represents the first known instance where a method of detecting , diagnosing and subsequently effectively treating , in an accurate and minimally invasive manner , the cause ( s ) that sustain , perpetuate , or “ drive ” human biological disorders has been described . this method enables the physician to target these sources for modification or elimination to abolish the disorder . although one preferred embodiment is for minimally invasive procedures for heart rhythm disorders , the invention can also be applied to surgical therapy , and for disorders of electrical impulse generation or propagation in organs such as the brain , central nervous system ( where it may locate causes of epilepsy or seizure ), peripheral nervous system ( where it may detect tumors ), skeletal muscle and smooth muscle such as the gastrointestinal tract , bladder and uterus . in accordance with an embodiment of the invention , there is disclosed an apparatus to sample signals , for example a sensor device such as an electrode catheter from multiple locations within a human organ , such as the human heart , at varying spatial resolutions and fields of view and with apparatus to alter the number of sensing channels accordingly . in accordance with an embodiment of the invention , there is disclosed a method to identify and localize electrical rotors , focal beats and other localized causes for heart rhythms , including complex rhythms such as af , vf and polymorphic vt . embodiments of the invention may use processes and software methods such as ordering the activation sequence to create an activation trail , processes such as the hilbert transform , other phase delay methods , spatial coherence analysis and other methods . in one embodiment of the invention , data collected from sensors and analyzed is stored as data in a database that is automatically updated . this database is used to assist the physician in the diagnosis / detection of localized causes , or to classify a pattern of causes of rhythm disorders . this may take the form of a probability distribution map of causes in patients with specific characteristics . in accordance with another embodiment of the invention , there is provided an apparatus to display causes for the biological rhythm in a format that can assist the physician in treatment . for example , a visual display screen may be connected to a processor to allow for viewing of the activation trail and to allow for visual location of the core of a rotor , focal source or other cause of the disorder . audio formats may also be used alone or in combination with the visual format . for example , in addition to or instead of the visual depiction of the source such that the core can be visually identified , the coordinates of the source and its core can be provided to the user by audio indications as to the location and cause of the disorder . visual depiction is particularly desirable because it provides the practitioner with a clear representation of the cause and provides a reference for identifying the core of the cause , which greatly facilitates the selection of treatments . for example , a visual representation of the actual rotor or focal beat allows the practitioner to accurately determine where to direct the ablation catheter or other treatment . in accordance with another embodiment of the invention , once the cause of the disorder is identified , use of a treatment device or method , to modify or destroy the site of an identified and localized source may be employed to treat or eliminate the rhythm disorder . non - limiting examples of treatment devices and methods include the use of destructive energy ( ablation ) such as by ablation catheters , surgical ablation methods , surgical removal or using devices inside the heart such as implanted leads or other physical device , stimulating energy ( pacing ), direct delivery of pharmacologic agents , cellular therapy or other intervention techniques . in one embodiment , a catheter capable of sensing signals from the body , and particularly from the heart , may also include a means of treatment , such as the ability to delivery ablation energy , stimulation energy , drug therapy , cellular therapy such as stem cells or gene therapy , or other treatment means . thus , such a catheter may be employed both in the detection and in the treatment of the disorder . the present invention is particularly suited for the detection , diagnosis and treatment of complex heart rhythm disorders such as , for example , vf , polymorphic vt , torsade de pointes and af , where once the localized cause is accurately identified and pinpointed , accurate and targeted ablation of the localized cause may be implemented . as discussed above , identification and physical location of the cause was previously not possible , and hence extraordinarily difficult even for experienced practitioners to treat successfully , much less substantially ameliorate or eliminate . in addition to finding the cause of and subsequently treating complex heart rhythm disorders , the present invention may also be applied to help diagnose and treat ‘ simple ’ rhythms that emanate from a single site by accelerating and simplifying analysis for the practitioner . for heart rhythm disorders , such simple disorders include focal atrial tachycardias , multifocal atrial tachycardias ( mat ), sinus nodal reentry or inappropriate sinus tachycardia , ventricular tachycardia ( vt ), premature atrial complexes ( pacs ) and premature ventricular complexes ( pvcs ). included in the invention are a process and system to collect data , including sensing devices and recording systems the collected data includes at least the location of each sensor which transmitted one or more signals and the onset time at which each activation signal or activation time duration occurred . the processor receives this information and sequentially orders the activation onset times . the result of this computation is the creation of an activation trail which creates a signature pattern for the disorder and indicates both the location and the type of the cause to the disorder , i . e ., whether it is a rotor , focal source or a dispersed pattern , i . e ., no localized source , hence requiring further data to be collected from a different area of the heart or other body region . the data once ordered in this manner creates an activation trail which can visually be depicted on a visual display to show , in the case of a rotor source , the actual rotational pattern of the rotor such that the core of the rotor is visually apparent and can easily be identified and hence treated . the same hold true for the depiction of a radially emanating source , such as a focal beat . the sequential ordering of the activation onset times at each sensor permits the location of focal rhythm disorders , such that the focal core can be easily located on the visual display for targeted and accurate treatment . desirably , the rhythm sources or causes are displayed over a period of time to allow the practitioner to fully observe the causal point or area and to make a comfortable assessment as to the appropriate treatment at the causal location . in one embodiment the data and / or the visual displays of the processed data ( i . e ., a “ movie ” of the activation trail ) elucidates the signature pattern of the cause of the rhythm disorder . such stored information allows for the practitioner to consult previous patterns to aid in improving the identification , localization and treatment of similar causes . in some instances , such stored information allows for extrapolation of measured real - time data to provide predictive models or to clarify certain measured patterns using similar known patterns . a further embodiment of the invention provides a process and system for the treatment of such causes , often by modification or destruction of tissue where causes reside . sixth , a preferred embodiment enables the invention to be used in an “ offline ”, non - real - time review mode , rather than directly during a procedure to treat a patient . the process and system of the invention may be employed to localize sources ( i . e ., find the physical location of the cause ) for abnormal electrical impulse generation or propagation in the brain or central nervous system using the electroencephalogram or other index to guide invasive therapy ( surgery ) or external beam irradiation to identify and treat seizure or epileptic foci , or focal tumors ( malignant or otherwise ). the invention may also be used to identify sources for abnormal impulse propagation in striated muscle ( such as injury in skeletal muscle ), the gastrointestinal system ( such as esophageal spasm ), the urogenital and respiratory systems . the invention may also be used to detect tumors ( malignant or otherwise ) in any body system . the invention also has applications outside of medicine , such as for locating the source of a seismic event or for locating energy sources in tandem with methods such as radar or sonar . the invention has several aspects to its process and system for carrying out the process . by way of example and not of limitation , in one aspect of the invention , signals are detected from multiple locations in an organ in the rhythm disorder , altering the spacing between sensors to optimize clarity of said sensing . a particularly desirable embodiment also records these signals from a heart , or other body part , during a rhythm disorder and stores them in a data base . the location of each sensor associated with a particular signal , as well as the activation onset times at each sensor are transmitted to a processor for analysis including sequential ordering to form the activation trail identifying the cause of the disorder and its specific location in the body . creating a database of causes , which may be manually or automatically updated allows for accessing the data base to assist in the identification and localization of disorder causes . this is used when data collection in the current patient is of limited quality , to compare the pattern in a patient to prior recorded rhythms in the patient to determine if the rhythm is the same or different , or to compare the pattern in a patient to that from another patient , such as one with similar clinical characteristics . previously stored data from a previous case may be used to help identify , localize and display causes for the rhythm disorder in a present case . visually displaying the sources of the disorder is extremely useful to the practitioner because it serves as a visual guide to the existence and location of the cause , and permits subsequent targeted and accurate treatment to ameliorate or eliminate the rhythm disorder . in other aspects of the invention , previously stored data from another case may be used to identify , localize and display causes for the rhythm disorder in a present case . this can then be used to plan the use of this invention in a future procedure . fig1 shows a schematic of various useful components ( modules ) which may be used in the process and system of the invention . the modules may be separate from each other and cooperatively interfaced to provide their function , or one or more of them may be integrated with each other of contained in the processor , such that the system has less separate hardware units . fig1 depicts an embodiment which allows a cause of the disorder to be localized during a minimally invasive percutaneous procedure , or other procedures such as using surface ecg , a magnetocardiogram , an echocardiographic and / or doppler measurements from ultrasound , electromagnetic radiation , sound waves , microwaves , or electrical impedance changes . in fig1 , electrical events in the heart 10 are recorded with sensing electrodes . these electrodes may be catheters 20 placed within the chambers or vasculature of the heart , including custom - designed recording catheters exemplified in fig2 - 4 , the electrodes may also be extensions of leads from an implanted pacemaker or cardioverter - defibrillator , catheters used to record monophasic action potentials or other signals , that typically arrive via the vena cavae or coronary sinus 22 . thus , although particularly useful in the invention , the process and system of the invention need not , however , employ the specialized catheters of fig2 - 4 , as any catheters or sensing devices used inside or outside of the body which capable of accurately transmitting the activation times and location of their occurrence may be employed . electrodes 23 may record from the epicardial or pericardial surface of the heart , accessed via electrodes 21 in the coronary sinus , via the electrodes 23 in the pericardial space or other routes . electrodes may be located in proximity to the nerves supplying the heart 15 , which may be located in the left atrium and ventricles . electrodes may be virtual ( computed ) electrodes from a computerized mapping system , routine or high - resolution ecg mapping electrodes 30 , electrodes implanted under or on the skin , or derived from methods to non - invasively detect signals without directly contacting the heart or body . electrode information may also be derived from stored electrograms in a database 160 . an electrode 25 placed near the heart may be used to modify or destroy regions that are near or at the cause ( s ) for a rhythm disorder . if the electrode is an ablation catheter , it interfaces to an energy generator 60 . other electrodes may interface with a controller 40 , and a pacing module 50 , and all desirably communicate with a process controller 70 . ablation or pacing can be directed to nerves supplying the heart 15 , which are located at many locations of the heart . internal ablation electrodes may be replaced with an external ablation system , such as external probes during surgery , or as in external focused irradiation or photon beam as for cancer therapy . in addition , modification of sources , i . e ., treatment of the causes of the disorder , may be achieved by delivering appropriate pharmaceutical compositions , gene therapy , cell therapy , or by excluding tissue ( at surgery or by using specialized devices ). the process controller 70 may include various components or modules . on such component or module includes a sampling module 80 which is capable of recording signals during the rhythm disorder , recording at various rates not in the rhythm disorder ( by pacing ), and / or recording during rates that simulate the heart rhythm disorder ( by pacing or other methods ). signal amplifiers ( not shown ) may be used to enhance the signal clarity and strength , and the process controller may also intelligently assign the fewest number of recording amplifiers to sense from a sufficient number of locations to identify and localize the cause . for instance , the system may use only 50 - 60 physical amplifier channels to record from 128 sensors ( for example , from two commercially available multipolar catheters ), by recording those 128 sensors on a “ time - share ” basis by time - slicing , or by activating individual / multiple sensors close to a rhythm cause while deactivating others . this “ switching ” functionality may be performed by a switching component that connects the sensor device with the electronic control system , and that may be embodied in one or more other components . switching may be manual or automatic , determined for instance on where causes of the heart rhythm disorder lie . module 90 interfaces with the pacing module to provide additional heart rates for sensing the biosignal . this is particularly useful for the non - real time mode ( mode 6 ), described herein , because it can study the heart at different heart rates even when not in the particular heart rhythm disorder being diagnosed and treated . the inventive method and system processes the collected data using analytical methods , which may be performed by analytic modules . for example , in fig1 , module 100 is part i of an “ analytic engine .” this portion of the analytic engine determines the onset and offset for the biologic signal over time , at each sensed location . this is implemented by creating a series of activation times ( onset timing ) and recovery times ( offset timing ) during the rhythm over time ( illustrated in fig6 ). the signal is typically represented as voltage over time ( that is , as a voltage - time series ). activation time can be processed in many ways . the simplest includes manual assignment at each location . automated or calculated assignment can be achieved by using zero of the first derivative to define maxima or minima , zero of the second derivative to indicate maximum upstroke or downstroke , or similar methods . activation onset and offset times can also be assigned when the voltage time - series crosses a threshold . another possible method to assign activation times is using pattern - matching . for instance , a pattern selected to represent the activation duration can be correlated to the signal at multiple time points over time . the time when said correlation values are high indicate recurrences of said template , and thus are considered activation times . the template used for this analysis can also be obtained from stored data in a database , or computed from a rate estimate for the rhythm at that location . simultaneous recordings from multiple sensors can help in analyzing activation , particularly for complex rhythms such as af or vf when signal quality may be noisy , of poor quality or show multiple components at different times . from simultaneous recordings , a reference signal is selected , preferably at a nearby location to the channel being analyzed . signals on the reference channel are used to select signal or signal components on the channel being analyzed . this can be done by using components that retain a similar timing over time , using pattern matching or correlation functions , vectorial analysis or other methods . if many methods are required , heuristics , pattern recognition methods , and so - called “ fuzzy logic ” approaches can be applied , constrained by known pathophysiology of the atrium . module 110 is part ii of the analytic engine that actually computes and localizes , i . e ., determines the existence and location of sources ( causes ) for the heart rhythm disorder . some embodiments of the invention include a “ therapy engine ,” which may contain one of more modules designed to cooperatively perform different functions in the system and process . for example , module 120 in fig1 may be responsible for determining the location and migration pattern of sources for the rhythm disorder within the heart . this may be a first module of the therapy engine , and is used to compute the location and spatial region which is required to be modified in order to treat or eliminate the rhythm disorder . treatment may be by delivery of ablation energy or other means as discussed herein , and is not simply one point or region if the source migrates during ablation . module 130 is representative of another module of the therapy engine , and desirably directly interfaces with the energy generator 60 to ablate ( destroy ), modify ( ablate or pace ) or stimulate ( pace ) tissue at sites likely to represent sources . alternatively , the module 130 may be used to modify tissue without destructive energy , for example by delivering pharmaceutical agents , or gene or cellular therapies . module 170 of the system shown in fig1 is representative of a tool to display the identification or location of causes visually or in auditory fashion , to assist the physician in treating or eliminating the rhythm disorder . for example , this module may include a display screen which permits the textual , graphic and / or auditory visualization on the screen of the rotor , focal or other cause of the disorder to be clearly seen by the practitioner . in some embodiments , a “ movie ” clip of the disorder found will be presented on the screen . this clip is a real - time presentation of the actual cause and location of the disorder . for example , once the analysis of the data has been performed in accordance with the process of the invention , i . e ., the location of the signals and their activation onset times have been sequentially ordered , the result of this analysis and computation will be shown on the screen in the form of an activation trail . if the pattern of the activation trail signifies a series of activations revolving around a central core , then a rotor has been found and is in fact a cause of the disorder . similarly , if the pattern of the activation trail signifies a series of activations which emanate radially from a central core region , then a focal beat has been found and is in fact a cause of the disorder . thus , the inventive process permits the direct finding of the cause of the disorder and the convenient visualization of the existence , type and location of the disorder for the practitioner . in the event that no discernable pattern is found , i . e ., the activation trail is not localized , then additional signal sampling by moving the sensor locations and / or turning - on already placed sensors may be appropriate . the additional signal samples may then be processed in accordance with the invention and shown on the screen . if a cause is found via the additional sampling and processing of the data , then a decision as to the appropriate treatment may be made . in the event that a dispersed activation trail and pattern is found , further additional sampling may be advisable until such time as the practitioner feels is sufficient . in some instances , the result of the process will render a finding of the existence and location of a rotor or a radially emanating focus . in other instances , where a dispersed pattern remains even after repeated sampling and processing , a diagnosis may be made ruling out a rotor or focal beats as the cause . thus , the finding of a rotor or a focal point ( beat ) will be essentially a detection and diagnosis concurrently , whereas the lack of such a finding will be a diagnosis which may rule out the presence of either of these causes of the disorder . signal sampling can be done in real time , during a procedure to ablate or treat the rhythm disorder , beforehand to plan for a procedure , or afterwards to review the disorder . as stated above , signals are collected at one or more locations from the organ using a variety of sensor types . contact sensors should maintain as good a contact with the tissue as possible . in the preferred mode , electrodes should record at multiple sites simultaneously or nearly simultaneously . the fastest heart rhythm disorders such as af have cycle lengths & gt ; 100 ms , so that signal acquisition for substantially less than this time is considered ‘ nearly simultaneous ’. an alternative mode of operation allows moving a sensor to sequential sites . the invention may be used with any existing sensor apparatus . although a variety of commercially available electrode devices may be used to obtain signal sampling , particularly useful device embodiments for signal sampling are shown in fig2 - 4 . these apparatuses use multiple sensors that may be individually activated or deactivated , or moved relative to one another . this enables adaptive spatial resolution , in that sensor spacing can be increased or decreased as desired . widely - spaced sensors provide a wide field of view to ‘ survey ’ the rhythm for a large portion of the organ ( e . g . left atrium of the heart ). once the source location is approximated , the configuration is desirably altered to reduce sensor spacing for higher spatial resolution over a narrow field of view . a tightly spaced sensor configuration is preferred for applying energy to a focused region to treat a source . adaptive spatial resolution is an important advantage of various embodiments of the present invention . this can be achieved by physically moving sensors . fig2 shows concentric helices 200 , with multiple sensing elements 205 ( electrodes or probes ) for sensing signals and , in some instances , delivering energy or other treatment therapy . the helices are widely spaced when parts 210 of the catheter remains non - deployed inside the shaft 215 . rotating and advancing the assembly introduces more probes in the chamber , and reduces their spacing . fig3 illustrates another embodiment of an inventive sensor catheter in the form of an adjustable fan catheter , with multiple meridians 230 each containing multiple sensing elements 240 ( electrodes or probes ), also for sensing and in some instances for delivering energy or other treatment therapy . by a combination of twisting or torsional motion along the shaft axis 245 , the meridians 230 may be more widely spaced or more closely spaced , as indicated by arrows 235 , i . e ., spatially adjusted . fig4 shows another embodiment of an inventive sensor catheter in the form of an adjustable corkscrew design , with a small number of spiral meridians 260 ending on a blunt non - traumatic end 270 . as with the design structures of fig2 and 3 , the meridians of fig4 may include multiple elements 265 ( electrodes or probes ). the corkscrew can be advanced or retracted into the sheath by manipulating the shaft 280 , to increase or decrease the corkscrew size and / or probe spacing . these designs can be made larger or smaller to fit a larger or smaller organ ( e . g . atria of varying sizes ), or substructures including pulmonary veins or the superior vena cava that may be sources for rhythms such as af . physical movement can be achieved manually by the physician or automatically by using machines . given the observed properties of sources for heart rhythm disorders , it is desirable that the sensors sense from at least about 25 % of the surface area of each one or more chambers of the heart . these designs are illustrative only , and are not intended to limit the actual physical design or application of this invention . optimal contact for each sensor can be monitored by the process controller 70 for adequacy in various ways . for example , the process controller 70 can verify contact via stability in the amplitude of sensed signals . alternatively , the process controller 70 can condition the pacing module 50 to emit signals through electrodes 20 - 30 , and use the amplitude of evoked responses to verify contact . as a third alternative , the process controller 70 can determine contact by confirming stable tissue impedance ( in af , for instance , where pacing is not possible ). as other alternatives , catheters designed to examine mild injury patterns , or designed to directly measure contact force , can be used . in addition , catheter manipulation can be controlled robotically in semi - automated or automated fashion , as well as manually . adaptive spatial resolution can also be achieved electronically . sensors in this adjustable sensor device are connected to an electronic control system that may activate or deactivate individual sensors . this may be performed manually , such as if the physician wishes only to focus on one region of the organ , or automatically by the process controller in fig1 to focus on a region determined to be where the heart rhythm source lies . an electronic switching apparatus controls independent switching of connections between the sensors and electronic control system , in order to maximize use of a practical number of amplifier channels . these electronic components may be embodied by various combinations of traditional ( wired ) electrodes , fiber optics , etched - wafer circuit designs , biologic sensors , chemical sensors , pharmaceutical sensors , piezoelectric sensors , infrared sensors , patient - compliant optical imaging , optrodes , remote sensors and other designs . electronic switching may also be achieved by time - slicing . a large number of locations may need to be sensed , but the number of sensing channels may be limited . signal time - slicing can record a larger number of sensing channels from a smaller number of channels . for instance , signals are often sampled every 1 ms ( at 1 khz ) although data acquired every 10 milliseconds ( ms ) or so is often sufficient for af or vf source analysis . thus , the system can sense at location 1 for 3 ms , locations 2 and 3 for 3 ms each , then return to sensor 1 to repeat the cycle at the 10 ms time point . in this way , 90 locations can be sensed using 30 channels . any appropriate configuration can be used , depending on the switching time in hardware or software , and allowing for noise factors when switching between channels . many other methods can be used to increase the effective number of channels , including sending multiplexed signals along a fiber optic or other device , or storing signals in random access memory then using off - line analysis to amplify and analyze each in turn . numbers of sensed locations can also be increased using a combination of sensors lying in contact with different heart planes . for instance , electrodes on the endocardial ( inner ) surface of the heart may be complemented by electrodes on the epicardial ( outer ) surface and possibly those in the heart muscle itself ( via implanted electrodes ) to increase overall spatial resolution . this is of particular value in the atrium , whose wall is thin and where epicardial and endocardial electrodes may target similar regions . in the ventricle , or in thick walled regions of the atrium , different planes may provide different information . in certain preferred embodiments , sensing can be performed using one or more sensors ( probes ) moved sequentially within the organ during the heart rhythm disorder . when a single probe is used , signals from each location are aligned relative to a timing signal fiducial . this method is easy to apply when a rhythm is relatively regular within the heart , such as the ‘ simple ’ disorders of focal atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter . however , this method can also be used as an approximate guide if the rhythm is irregular within the heart , such as the complex rhythms of af or vf . this has the advantage of requiring fewer sensors , and will work if sources show some stability in space . for instance , while af is irregular , activation may be regular at localized sources , for example at certain locations such as near the pulmonary veins . one particularly useful embodiment for using sequential sensing at multiple locations is now illustrated for a moving probe with two sensors ( such as the two bipoles of a clinical quadripolar catheter ), although more sensors may be applied if available . at each location , one sensor is considered the reference and the onset times for successive cycles ( beats ) are fiducials . the difference in activation time at the second sensor is used to indicate relative timing . the probe is now moved so that one sensor overlies the previously sensed location . the second sensor now senses a fresh location and can record relative timing onsets for multiple beats here . the process is repeated for the entire region of interest . because this process introduces stability in relative timing between locations , variability can be reintroduced stochastically using observed beat - to - beat timing variations at each location . an alternative approach is to use gradients in rate and / or organization within the chamber , compared to stored data from a database for that rhythm ( including af or vf ). after sensing sequential locations , the activation rate in both chambers is compared to stored patterns that describe this relationship at various sources ( rotors or focal beats ) and surrounding sites . an error - minimization approach ( such as least - square - errors ) may be used to estimate the source location . estimates may be refined adaptively , based on similarity to subsets of stored patterns and using algorithmic , heuristic , fuzzy logic or other pattern recognition scheme . this process is repeated iteratively . for a spatially consistent source , second and subsequent iterations will add precision to the original estimate , and may be focused at locations closest to the estimated source . delivery of treatment therapy may be another feature of the sensor device , that will be described in detail later herein . the first step in analysis is to determine the signal type , using a lookup table as illustrated in fig5 , reference numerals 400 - 460 . this step determines if the signal arises from the heart ( cardiac ), brain , respiratory system , gastrointestinal tract , urogenital system , and so on . if cardiac , the signal may be a surface ecg , intracardiac , echocardiographic or other signal . if intracardiac , the signal is further classified as an action potential ( monophasic action potential ), bipolar electrogram , unipolar electrogram or other . some of these signals provide high quality information ( e . g . monophasic action potential recordings in the heart ), while others do not . lower quality signals are more likely to require pre - processing , filtering , averaging , comparison against stored signals in a database , in that patient at different times and other computational steps to allow source localization . in fig6 , the signal is parsed between steps 800 - 840 to identify its type in the lookup table ( from fig5 ). this includes assigning activation onset and offset , and the interval between beats ( diastolic interval ) that depends upon the signal type illustrated in the lookup table in fig5 . the lookup table can be a comprehensive biosignal inventory , with data on the distinct physiological role of each component for computational purposes . components may vary with rate and may fluctuate from beat to beat . each signal component may reflect a distinct aspect of normal or abnormal physiology and thus indicate likelihood that the rhythm disorder may arise . examples are not intended to limit the scope of the lookup table , which may include signals from other muscles ( e . g . skeletal muscle , bladder and gastrointestinal tract ), the brain and the nervous system . the next step in analysis is to define , for each sensed location , the physiological signal to be analyzed . the goal is that the resulting signal best represents actual physiological activation and recovery occurring in the heart rhythm disorder at each location . when the recorded signal is “ clean ” ( has a high signal - to - noise ratio ), this will be the physiological signal . if signals are noisy , then filtering , noise reduction and other schemes may be needed to reveal the physiological signal . said noise schemes may require recording while the patient holds his / her breath for several seconds . for analysis of atrial rhythm disorders , the physiological signal is best recorded between ventricular activations ( in the r - r interval ), that may be facilitated if the heartbeat is reduced ( r - r interval is prolonged ) using agents to slow ventricular rate or by reducing pacemaker rate in patients with such devices . fig7 a - 7g illustrate a particularly useful embodiment for constructing physiological signals using computational methods to compensate for limitations due to noisy or low quality data . first , the response to rate of each signal type ( monophasic action potentials , map , illustrated in fig7 a ( patient without af ), 7 c ( af patient ) and 7 e ( af patient )) is determined . this is performed by sensing signals at varying rates when in the rhythm disorder , or when not in the rhythm disorder ( such as by pacing , see mode 6 , discussed below ). the response of the signal duration ( illustrated for map ) to varying rate is shown in fig7 b , 7d and 7f . fig7 b ( no af ) shows no shortening with rate , while , with af , fig7 d and 7f show that map shortens at increasing rate ( that is , when diastolic interval shortens ). it is to be noted that the response to the same set of rates may vary when the patient is and is not in the heart rhythm disorder . fig8 a - 8e show this . pacing with delivery of a single extra beat in fig8 a results in the restitution plot shown in fig8 b as soon as af begins . however , after several minutes , the restitution curve changes as shown in fig8 c - 8e . one approach embodied in the present invention is to create a ‘ hybrid ’ signal by inserting a physiological pattern at the time of each activation time onset ( waveforms 660 - 670 in fig7 g ). the physiological pattern may be obtained by averaging recorded signals over time ( algebraically , from the median beat average or other method ), averaging signals at neighboring locations ( spatial averaging ), from monophasic action potentials at various locations ( waveforms 660 - 670 ), by filtering existing unipolar or bipolar signals in the frequency or time - frequency domain , or by using stored patterns from a database ( fig1 , database 160 ). when stored signals are used , properties including duration of these physiological patterns may be adjusted for rate using rate - response ( restitution ) behavior . stored signals may be obtained from this patient , another patient with similar characteristics or another stored relationship . these processes may be applied to individual activations , or to the entire signal . this method results in a physiological representation of activity at each location over time that may otherwise be difficult to obtain in the beating heart of patients during minimally invasive procedures . it has applications outside of heart rhythm disorders . for instance , said physiological pattern may be a model of cellular ion function . this enables the function of these ion currents at each sensor to be modeled cells timed to each observed activation , for the study of dynamics of calcium fluxes , potassium currents or other processes within the beating heart of this patient . by way of a further example , this physiological pattern may be a model of a pharmacological ligand , allowing study on the behavior of the beating heart to specific pharmacologic agents . in the gastrointestinal tract , cellular hormone release models may be studied for each peristaltic “ beat .” in the brain , known kinetics of neurotransmitter or endorphin release for discrete brain waves ( non - invasive , via the scalp electroencephalogram or invasive , as surgery ) may help to understand and treat various conditions . treatment of conditions of epilepsy , for example , using the present invention is one embodiment of the invention . this invention also includes a method for determining the effect of a pharmacological or bioeffecting agent on the body by correlating the behavior of the beating heart or rhythm of another body part with the release , binding capacity or rate , or other action of the agent on the body . an activation trail is then determined from sequences of activation in the physiological signal at multiple locations . the simplest form of this analysis is to order activation at each location sequentially in time . in other embodiments , analysis may identify and locate causes for a rhythm disorder using frequency domain methods , time - domain methods or spatial - phase methods . frequency domain methods include the hilbert transform or wavelet transform or phase delay methods . spatial phase methods involve analyzing the spatial inter - relationships between sites showing activation at a certain location , in order to define the activation trail . pertaining to phase - space methods , a well - known technique assigns a phase co to the signal at every electrode and at every time point . the phase at the exact location of the tip of the rotor is undefined and summing up the phase of neighboring electrodes results in a “ phase jump ” of 2π . thus , a rotor location corresponds to a phase singularity . mathematically , these phase singularities can be found by evaluating a line integral over a closed curve as φ { right arrow over (∇)} φ · d { right arrow over ( l )}=± 2π where the line integral is taken over a path / surrounding the phase singularity . since the signal from the electrode is a single observable , the determination of the phase requires special attention . we will employ several different methods depending on the quality of the electrode signal . the first phase - space method will be utilized if the signal from the electrodes is noisy and / or has a small amplitude . in this case , activation times for each electrode will be determined , followed by a novel analysis of wave front dynamics . as a first step , the spatial resolution of the probes and their activation times may be increased using a bi - linear interpolation scheme that interpolates activation using a fine regular grid created across the surface . in high quality physiological signals that contain activation , recovery and diastolic interval information , this results in a time trace v ( t ) for each point of the refined grid . since the shape of the action potential may be stable between beats , the method next defines a mapping from the membrane potential v to the phase cp . this map assigns a unique value of φ to each value of v such that the maximum and minimum of the phase variable differs by 2π . the detailed form of this map is arbitrary and the phase is computed using φ = 2π ( v − 0 . 5 ). the corresponding time trace of the phase variable results in construction of the signal and its phase instantaneously as in fig9 a - 9c . once the phase map is constructed the method will calculate , for each time , the sum of the phase for all four points of the fine regular grid separated by a grid spacing that form a square ( topological charge method ). a result not equal to zero indicates the existence of a phase singularity and a rotor . the analysis will be further aided by the tracking of wave fronts . the location of these fronts will be computed using the regular fine grid by determining where and when v crosses a threshold value with a positive derivative dv / dt . performing this calculation along the x and y direction of the fine regular grid and using linear interpolation between the grid points , will result in a set of points that lie on the wave front . the wave front is then constructed by connecting these points . a similar analysis will be performed for phase , where isophase lines are tracked . a two - dimensional visual representation is then constructed that plots for each time point the value of the membrane potential using a grayscale or color scale , lines representing the wave fronts , lines representing similar phase ( isophase lines ), and symbols locating the phase singularities . this visual aid will greatly benefit the practitioner in interpreting the results of the inventive process and system . note that the crossings of the lines representing the wave fronts and the isophase lines represent the phase singularity . phase singularities indicate core regions , and thus can be used to localize the rotors . the phase transform is able to demonstrate focal beats in af — typically as centrifugal sources emanating from a localized area . a focal beat is characterized by a location that fulfills three criteria : 1 ) its activation time is earlier that at surrounding locations ; 2 ) this region was previously inactive ( in diastole ) for a specified period of time ; 3 ) the subsequent spread of activation emanates radially from the core region . recognizing these 3 criteria , the invention finds these sources automatically . this algorithm will first determine locations that exhibit activation times ahead of their four nearest and four next - nearest neighbors and mark these as potential focal sources . next , it determines the activation times at locations surrounding a potential focal source . if the activation times of these locations are earlier than their surrounding electrodes , the potential focal source is confirmed and is marked accordingly . these sites are plotted using our plotting technique as described above , greatly aiding the practitioner in localizing and interpreting these sources . alternatively , frequency domain methods may be used . on the physiological signal during the heart rhythm disorder , that may be the recorded signal or a signal derived after filtering , noise reduction and other strategies described above , one may employ several methods . one such method is the hilbert transform . the hilbert transform shifts the phase of the negative frequencies of a signal by π / 2 and the phase of the positive frequencies by − π / 2 . in this approach , determination of the phase co of the signal is achieved by plotting voltage against the hilbert transform of the voltage . the particularly useful embodiment applies a detrending algorithm to set the voltages at the activation times ( maximum dv / dt ) to zero . the hilbert transform is used to construct the phase plane of detrended signals . the hilbert transform at all locations is interpolated across the fine regular grid created across the biological surface . phase is then calculated from the state - space plot of voltage versus its hilbert transform . again , the spatial distributions of phase will be analyzed with the topological charge technique described above to locate phase singularities associated with phase singularities ( the ends of wavefronts ) such as at the tip of a reentrant wave . activation wavefronts are constructed using the same technique as described above while isolines of zero phase will also be tracked . an example of our methods in the human atria is shown in fig1 a and 12 c , which show rotors in the left atrium computed using frequency - domain methods . another useful method employs a time delay embedding technique to determine the phase of the signal . this technique consists of plotting v ( t + τ )− v * vs . v ( t )− v * for a fixed time delay τ and offset v *, resulting in a value of the phase φ for each time point and each location . in practice , the time delay and offset will be determined by the practitioner after examining these plots for several locations using different values for and v *. optimal values lead to trajectories that do not cross ( that would lead to a non - unique value for the phase ) and that encircle the origin ( ensuring that the minimum and maximum phase differs by 2π ). both the signal and the phase are interpolated across a fine regular grid created across the biological surface . the resulting phase map will then be examined for phase singularities and wave fronts will be tracked as described above . yet another useful method used to determine the phase of the signal is a wavelet transform . the exact form of this wavelet is variable , and an example includes the haar wavelet . the wavelet transform will be computed for each location . the wavelet allows us to view the signal in multiple frequency resolutions . this will enable us to filter unwanted noise at specific frequencies ( or frequency bands ). in this approach , the phase transformation is achieved by plotting voltage against the phase shifted wavelet transform of the voltage . once the phase φ has been calculated , we will precede as before , including refining the grid through bi - linear interpolation , finding phase singularity and tracking wave fronts . other information , such as locations within the organ of sites of rapid rate during the rhythm disorder , the presence of very regular sites surrounded by less regular sites , the presence of stable beat - to - beat configuration ( shape ) for successive signals as opposed to varying signal configurations , proximity to anatomic features known to be associated with particular rhythm disorders ( such as pulmonary veins in af , his - purkinje system in vf ), or a combination thereof may also assist in identifying and locating sources . several types of activation trails may result , producing corresponding discernible signature patterns for various types of causes for a rhythm disorder . an activation trail in which sequences of activation revolve around a central “ core ” region is termed a rotor . an activation trail that emanates radially from a core region is termed a focal beat ( or a site of repetitive focal activations or beats ). another activation trail type is a dispersed pattern , in which a localized source is not clearly identified . in particularly useful embodiment , in such cases , signal sensing is repeated at additional locations or for additional periods of time . localization of a cause for a heart rhythm disorder is based on the location of the core region and additional activation from this region . some embodiments identify the core region directly . for instance , the hilbert transform and direct phase assignment methods identify the core region as the site where real and imaginary parts of the analysis intersect . in contrast , the direct sequential ordering method of the present invention indicates a core region either visually or analytically . in fig1 , operations 1400 - 1495 describe the process of optimally identifying , locating and selecting cause ( s ) that are most likely to indicate primary causes of the rhythm disorder . in one particularly desirable embodiment , a probability map 1480 for sources of the disorder is constructed . this indicates a likelihood that each sensed location harbors a cause of the rhythm disorder , relative to other sensed locations . a higher relative likelihood is assigned for sites where core regions sustain for longer periods of time ( or , for more rotations or beats ), where the rate of activation is faster , where the rate of activation is more organized , that activate surrounding tissue in a 1 : 1 fashion ( thus , there is electrogram linking ) and activate larger regions of tissue in phase ( and thus have a large space constant ), when fewer concurrent sources are identified , for sources that lie near known regions of high likelihood for rhythm disorders such as the pulmonary veins in human af , for sources with less migration over time , and for rotor versus focal beat types of source . in one particularly useful embodiment , probabilities are assigned after comparison with stored examples in a database ; the comparison may take the form of a stepwise multivariate comparison . in the limited case , a spatially fixed source that is a solitary electrical rotor that directly activates the entire organ , is by definition a primary cause of that heart rhythm disorder . surrogates for the activation trail also exist . these are data that approximate the identification and localization provided by the invention using data from fewer locations , less lengthy or detailed recordings , or using information from other resources such as the ecg rather than from within the heart . thus , surrogates enable approximation of the activation trail using a reduced number of sensor locations compared to an analysis that directly measures the activation trail . these surrogates , used independently or in combinations , include sites of rapid rate during the rhythm disorder , the presence of very regular sites surrounded by less regular sites , the presence of stable beat - to - beat configuration ( shape ) for successive signals as opposed to varying signal configurations , signals where amplitude is particularly low , signals that are very prolonged for each activation is very prolonged , proximity to anatomic features known to be associated with particular rhythm disorders ( such as pulmonary veins in af , his - purkinje system in vf ), or a combination thereof may also assist in identifying and locating sources . surrogates may be detected from the ecg , and thus be used to plan a procedure or guide therapy in a patient . vectorial analyses of the ecg for regions of regularity and high rate , particularly if surrounded by regions of lower regularity and rate , indicate locations within the heart where sources lie . in fig1 , operations 1400 - 1495 summarize the approach to identify and locate sources . operations 1400 - 1450 determine if sufficient sensor resolution is present to identify a cause . criteria for sufficiency include the absence of discontinuities in the wave front calculation , and absence of jumps in the location of core regions , and an absolute sensor spacing that should not exceed approximately 1 cm . this is based upon computations that the minimum circumference of a reentry wave is & gt ; 2 cm in the human atrium and larger in the human ventricle . operations 1460 - 1490 then use a combination of optimized sensed data and stored data to compute sources , which are then treated at operation 1495 . the present invention includes the wide use of filtered or unfiltered clinical data , data from a database including this and other patients , or computational estimates to represent the signal to be analyzed as well as the results of analysis . in addition , the hybrid use of existing patient - acquired data , signal processing methods , numerical methods and stored signals from a database are major advantages of the inventive process and system , particularly because high - resolution physiological data from human atria or ventricles may be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to obtain at clinical electrophysiologic study without open heart surgery . all of the above approaches may be applied to any complex rhythm , including vf . of course , these approaches may also be applied to “ simple rhythms ” such as reentry around an anatomical obstacle or rotors anchored at scar tissue ( such as atrial flutter ). these inventive processes may be implemented in software , operated very quickly and are suitable for real - time , as well as off - line analysis , using small scale components such as those found in implantable devices , portable ambulatory machines , wristwatch - sized devices , as well as larger scale computers found in electrophysiology laboratories . data on sources for rhythm disorders desirably may be stored in a database 160 . this may be useful to classify sources in different patients , to help identify sources in a single patient , or to determine if a patient has returned with the same or a different source . data in the database will thus include the characteristics described above , including the number of concurrent sources , rate , variability in rate over time , duration , size of biological organ whose activation is directly caused by the source ( the space constant ), location , whether this location migrates over time , rate within multiple regions of the heart at the time that the source was detected ( such as left and right atrial rate during af ), and the response of each source to ablation . additional information to be stored in the database include one or more clinical factors from a group comprising gender ( male / female ), age , weight , height , presence of diabetes mellitus , blood pressure , atrial size , ventricular size , regions of atrial or ventricular scar , the left ventricular ejection fraction . in a particularly useful embodiment , the database of af sources 160 will be continuously updated , based upon new source localization from additional cases . this will be used to help source localization for practitioners studying new patients , by way of a software expert system that will match the new patient to already stored patterns . source data to be stored will be analyzed for consistency with existing data , matched by the above variables . only raw data that meets rigorous standards for data integrity will be incorporated , others will be rejected . after ensuring data integrity , data will be added to the database to improve localization for future patients . the invention and database interface may include an expert system that compares current data with stored data . based on the closest match or matches , logic within the invention determines if additional heart rhythm sources or additional characteristic should be studied , and whether they may lie based on stored information . this uses a “ goodness of fit ” against various stored parameters . this functionality is included because in practice , the number of sensed locations is limited by time constraints , in practice , many sensor locations may provide suboptimal data , thus limiting the actual sensed resolution , and because the inventor has observed that many patients show similar source locations and characteristics . database updates will be available to the practitioner regularly from a centrally located , secured database that contains the above information . no information on patient name , geographical location , study date or other items prohibited by the health information portability act ( hipaa ) will be included . this database will be maintained at a remote location but available electronically by means including wired and wireless communication , electronic media such as cds , dvds , and solid state storage devices . the invention includes methods and apparatus to communicate the identification , location and above characteristics of sources for biological rhythm disorders to the practitioner . this includes a visual display means , typically in the form of a graphical display on a computer monitor , or a printout showing the source in relation to cardiac anatomy , or a basic textual line summary of the location and / or sensor site where the source lies . an auditory display may also be used , that vocalizes the identification , location and above characteristics of sources for biological rhythm disorders to the practitioner . in one embodiment , this would include the conclusions or a summary of analysis rather than the analysis results themselves . in addition to the processes and systems of the invention used to detect and diagnose the cause of the rhythm disorder , the invention also includes devices and methods to treat the source for the biological rhythm disorder , in order to modify , ameliorate or eliminate said rhythm disorder . treatment of the source may employ any useful technique , including ablation with radiofrequency , freezing energy , microwaves or other sources . modification may also include cell therapy ( such as with stem cells ), gene therapy , pharmaceutical delivery , ionizing or non - ionizing radiation delivered by devices inside or outside the heart , or other interventions . treatment is delivered to modify the cause . in a simple heart rhythm disorder such as atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter , energy is applied directly to eliminate the cause . in a complex rhythm disorder , such as af , energy can be applied to ablate ( destroy ) the source , to isolate the source by destroying tissue between the source and the remainder of the viable heart chamber , or to modulate the interaction between different sources . this latter form of treatment is very novel and has been shown in experiments by the inventor to be extremely effective . modulation may be performed in a stochastic fashion . in a particularly desirable embodiment , therapy is targeted at the core region of an identified or localized cause for the rhythm disorder , with the intention of eliminating this cause to treat the heart rhythm disorder . this may be applied sequentially to identify , locate and treat more than one cause for said disorder . alternatively , therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source , with the intention of disconnecting the source from surrounding tissue . alternatively , therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source , with the intention of causing the source to migrate towards tissue where definitive treatment is more easily accomplished . for instance , if the source lies at a location where ablation is difficult due to anatomy , tissue thickness or other factors , ablation on one side of the source may cause it to migrate towards a location that is easier to ablate due to thinner tissue or anatomic factors . alternatively , therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source , with the intention of preventing movement of the source and thus compartmentalizing it . alternatively , therapy may be targeted at locations neighboring the core region for a source , with the intention of reducing the mass of tissue available for the source to sustain and thus causing it to terminate . treatment may take the form of ablation , delivered via a catheter in the heart ( element 25 in fig1 ), on the epicardial surface , or an electrode present on one of the multi - electrode catheter designs included herein , for example see fig2 - 4 . when a dispersed activation trail is observed , locations where sources may lie that are difficult to identify are targeted first . in patients with af , such sites include the pulmonary veins and other thoracic veins , and the atrial appendages . thus , pulmonary vein isolation is performed first , followed by therapy at additional sites if clinically suspected . signal sensing is then repeated to identify and locate a cause . in preferred particularly desirable embodiment , the multi sensor catheter ( fig2 - 4 ) includes an assembly that can deliver therapy in the form of ablation . in this embodiment , sensors at locations where the source lies are activated to deliver ablation energy to modify or eliminate the source . the system may deliver therapy in a spatial locus , as well as at fixed locations . in this system , the location of the source core region is analyzed constantly throughout therapy . therapy , such as ablation energy , is directed at varying locations and potentially multiple locations to constrain movement of the source . an analogy is to construct a “ fence ” of ablated tissue around a moving source in order to keep it in one location . this may require therapy delivery ( such as ablation ) at multiple sensors of said poles of said assembly concurrently . this process is continued until the rhythm terminates or a remote source becomes dominant . this invention is well suited to target therapy performed surgically in the operating room with direct exposure of the heart . this may be via a minimally invasive approach or traditional open chest heart exposure . the choice of recording electrode , sock , plaque or other equipment is up to the discretion of the surgeon and does not alter the principles of therapy . alternatively , said modulation can be applied by stimulating ( pacing ) the tissue . for pacing , the process controller 70 conditions the pacing module 50 , to stimulate the heart using electrodes in the heart 20 - 25 , electrodes on the body surface 30 , or electrodes elsewhere such as from the esophagus 150 . the electrode controller 40 receives signals from the electrodes before , during and after pacing . pacing is used to increase heart rate and introduce extra beats . in alternative embodiment , the invention can ablate or stimulate cardiac nerves to modify or eliminate the source . thus , if sources lie at locations of heart ganglionic plexuses , ablation or pacing of such locations can be used to modify the source . if the abnormal rhythm terminates after modify or eliminating sources , attempts can be made to restart the rhythm . in the case of heart rhythm disorders , this may include very rapid pacing , the administration of isoproterenol or other interventions . the entire application of this invention is then repeated . in the event that the abnormal rhythm can no longer be initiated , the physician may exercise the discretion to modify additional regions that may be potential sources . this information may be available directly from stored data in the database , matching patients with a similar classification to the current patient . in an important mode of operation , the invention can be used in a non - real time , offline analysis fashion . this review mode can be applied to data from this individual at another time , such as a prior electrophysiologic study , data from a different device ( such as an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator ) or even a prior failed ablation . this can be used to review results from a prior procedure , to review data from a patient prior to planning the application of this invention , or to assess if the same patient now presents with the same or a different source for their rhythm disorder . signals are first uploaded from stored electrograms in a database 160 to the processor controller 70 . this database can be the master database that stores data on multiple patients , or a patient - specific database . data storage and retrieval can be implemented for any signal type . stored signals can be derived from another source , a catalogued source , or computed or virtual signals such as from ensite 3000 ® or ensite navx ® by st jude medical , or carto ® by biosense - webster . signals may also be derived from a different individual , querying the database for a patient with similar demographics and heart rhythm disorder . in a separate non - real - time mode , data obtained when the patient is not in the heart rhythm disorder can be used by the invention to identify and locate sources for a rhythm disorder . this may be useful , for example , if the heart rhythm disorder is not observed at the time of a procedure , and cannot be started using conventional methods . this mode uses biological properties of the chamber to predict locations where sources / causes may lie when in the heart rhythm disorder . such locations include sites where the maximum slope of action potential duration restitution is & gt ; 1 , sites where beat - to - beat oscillations in the repolarization signal shape or duration are observed , or where conduction velocity restitution is broad to indicate slowed conduction at critical rates . in the preferred embodiment , to measure restitution it is necessary to sense signals for a wide range of rates at each location , as indicated in fig1 element 90 . this may be achieved using pacing . in this case , the process controller ( fig1 , element 70 ) conditions the pacing module 50 , to stimulate the heart using electrodes in the heart 20 - 25 , on the body surface 30 , in the esophagus 150 or elsewhere . the wider the range of rates , particularly fast rates , the more comprehensive the data range for that signal for analysis of restitution . when pacing is not an option , the invention will prompt the user to increase heart rate using other options or to use stored information from a database . in this embodiment , the rate - response (“ restitution ”) curve is created at each rate for each component of signals shown in fig5 . for example , this step may compute how monophasic action potential duration ( time from phase 0 to phase 3 ) varies with rate ( apd rate restitution ). examples of atrial apd restitution are shown in fig7 a - 7g and 8a - 8e . using pacing to increase the range of sampled heart rates provides a comprehensive assessment of rate response of each biosignal . fig7 a , 7c and 7e illustrate a useful embodiment , whereby human action potentials in the left atrium were recorded , each of which provided high quality information including depolarization ( phase 0 ), repolarization ( phases 1 - 3 ), phase 2 amplitude and action potential duration ( time interval from phase 0 to phase 3 ). phase 4 indicates the interval between one beat and the next . the invention may determine rate response ( restitution ) of multiple components , focusing on rate - response of ap duration ( time from phase 0 - 3 ), and ap phase ii amplitude . signal 400 ( fig5 ) is an ecg . this includes intra - atrial components ( the p wave and pr interval ), and ventricular components including depolarization ( the qrs complex ) and repolarization ( the t wave ). for atrium , the invention records how p - wave duration varies with rate , using analyses shown later in fig7 a - 7f . for the ventricle , the invention records how qt interval varies with rate as a measure of ventricular apd rate - behavior ( restitution ). individual qrs complexes are aligned using one of several columnar techniques , including methods that align electrograms about the point of largest positive or negative slope , their peak values or minimize their mean square differences , or metrics based on derived signals . t - waves are identified and aligned similarly . atrial activity is considered to lie in the intervening intervals . if the signal is a unipolar electrogram , it is also analyzed in analogous fashion . each is analyzed for waveform shape as well as duration . fig5 , items 430 - 440 indicate unipolar electrograms from the human left atrium 430 and left ventricle 440 respectively , with depolarization and repolarization measured collectively as the activation - recovery interval , a surrogate for the monophasic action potential duration . the invention determines adjustment of various components for rate . signals can also be bipolar electrograms ( items 450 , 460 ), and the invention determines rate response of each component . in an alternative embodiment , ecg and electrogram data are uploaded from a database 160 for analysis in an analogous fashion to the described real - time mode of operation . data from the database can be from the same or different patients , recorded at any time and using any acquisition system . in af , map restitution may differ from map when not in af . fig8 element 700 shows the initiation of af after pacing . element 710 shows map restitution during pacing in black . immediately after af onset ( red points ), apds track previously derived map restitution . however , this may not be true for longer - lasting af . elements 720 , 730 and 740 show patients with long - lasting af , in whom apd restitution differs from that obtained in pacing prior to af . thus , it may be advantageous to use apd restitution obtained from the patient in af , at this time or a previous time , or from stored apds in this or other patients , or filtered or computed data , for signal processing and analysis . locations where sources may arise during a subsequent heart rhythm disorder may now be predicted from these analyses . for monophasic action potentials , site where the maximum slope of mapd rate - behavior ( restitution )& gt ; 1 may be immediately adjacent to causes for vf or af . other indexes of high likelihood for the initiation of heart rhythm disorders include broad rate - response ( restitution ) of conduction , since such sites of dynamic conduction slowing may indicate sites where heart rhythm causes lie . the energy generator 60 may be activated to apply destructive energy ( either radiofrequency , cryoablation or microwave radiation ) via the ablation electrode 25 . this electrode can be moved within the heart manually by an operator , that is the traditional approach , or remotely using robotic or computer assisted guidance . the implementation of the system described herein may be based largely upon digital signal processing techniques . however , it should be appreciated that a person of ordinary skill in this technology area can easily adapt the digital techniques for analog signal processing . various features of the invention are set forth in the following claims . while the invention has been described in connection with particularly desirable embodiments , it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular form set forth , but on the contrary , it is intended to cover such alternatives , modifications , and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims . fig1 , panel 900 illustrates pre - ablation signals for a representative patient , a 47 - year - old man with persistent atrial fibrillation ( af ) for over five years . the patient continued to have symptomatic racing of the heart , which required him to visit hospital emergency rooms for treatment , despite various therapy with amiodarone and other appropriate therapy , and despite prior ablation procedures for af . given the severity of his symptoms , the patient therefore elected to return to the electrophysiology laboratory for further evaluation and ablation . fig1 , panel 900 shows signals from the right and left atria during af at the commencement of electrophysiologic study . it can be seen that the af cycle length ( time between successive activation onset times ) is quite short , shown as for example , 172 ms and 165 ms for the first two cycles ( arrows 910 ) in the right atrium , and varies , as is typical for af . notably , signals were more fractionated and disorganized in shape in the left atrium (“ post la ”) and coronary sinus (“ csp ” proximal coronary sinus ; “ csd ” distal coronary sinus ) than in the right atrium (“ hra ” high right atrium ; “ lat ra ” lateral right atrium ; “ post ra ” posterior right atrium ), as is common . these findings would normally guide ablation towards the left atrium . a typical procedure in this case would commence by ablating near the pulmonary veins and confirming isolation , followed by additional ablation selecting at sites including : ( a ) left atrial sites of fractionated electrograms , linear ablation at the roof , linear ablation at the mitral annulus , other linear ablation , then ( b ) right atrial ablation including sites of fractionation and the cavotricuspid isthmus . this proposed procedure would take approximately 2 - 3 hours with a & lt ; 50 % chance of terminating af , meaning that electrical cardioversion would be required to restore normal rhythm at the conclusion of the procedure ( calkins , brugada et al . 2007 ). rather than use this known approach , an embodiment of the method and treatment of the present invention was applied . a catheter assembly containing 64 sensors ( electrodes ) was inserted via the femoral veins into the right atrium , and across a trans - septal puncture into the left atrium of the patient . these were connected via wire cables to a recording system for collecting signals at each sensor during af . these signals were converted to digital form , and input into a computer program . activation onset times were recorded for 2 seconds of af at each sensor . while two seconds was used with this patient , any greater or lesser periods of time may be useful . desirably , one second or less may be used . in some embodiments , milliseconds may be used . activation onset times at each sensor location were sequentially ordered in time . stored action potential tracings were used to create an electrograph ( voltage - time series ), by inserting said tracings at the activation time onsets for each sensor . finally , a direct phase assignment technique was used to identify a core region . an activation trail is directly indicated by the relationship of these activation sequences to a core region — if they revolve around a core , then an electrical rotor is detected and considered to be a cause , but if they emanate radially from a core region , then a focal beat is detected and considered a cause . results were displayed as an animation on a computer monitor for physician review . the activation trail 1030 in fig1 a revealed an electrical rotor as the cause for this man &# 39 ; s af . in fig1 a , panel 1010 , activation onset times can be seen to revolve around a core region in the right atrium at times color - coded ( and alphabetically coded ) from 10 ms ( blue (“ b ”)) to 200 ms ( red (“ r ”)) ( panel 1010 ). no localized cause was found in the left atrium shown in fig1 b ( panel 1020 ). fig1 c , panel 1040 , displays this same rotor in a different form , as three snapshots in time of tissue that is depolarized ( activated ; red (“ r ”)) and repolarized ( not activated ; blue (“ lb ”)). viewed chronologically ( 0 ms , 100 ms and 170 ms , from left to right ), these snapshots also trace activation sequences revolving around a core region ( a rotor ). this core region had a high likelihood of being a cause , since it was a solitary source that controlled electrical activation for almost all of the surrounding atrium ( large space constant ). clinically , it was surprising that this electrical rotor lay in the right atrium . the right atrial rotor site neither showed high spectral dominant frequency , nor low amplitude fractionated signals , and would not normally be identified or targeted for ablation . ablation commenced directly at the rotor core in the right atrium ( panel 1050 ), at a site indicated by the red dot 1060 in fig1 d . notably , af slowed within 30 seconds of energy delivery to a cycle length of 227 ms . subsequent ablation at immediately adjacent sites , indicated by white dots 1070 in fig1 d , panel 1050 , further slowed af until it terminated to sinus rhythm within 6 minutes of ablation , as shown in fig1 . in fig1 , af can be seen to stop ( arrow 1110 ), followed by the restoration of normal sinus rhythm ( arrow 1120 ). at this point , af could not be restarted using the typical technique of rapid pacing as shown in fig1 , where segment 1210 shows rapid pacing with capture of the atrium , segment 1220 shows no induction of af , and segment 1230 shows sinus rhythm after the end of pacing . this result is paradigm - shifting compared to the current state - of - the - art , where slowing of af typically occurs after lengthy ablation that is widely and empirically applied ( to 30 - 40 % of the atrium ), yet termination of persistent af is still uncommon . conversely , we acutely slowed and acutely terminated af with ablation of less than approximately 2 - 3 % of the atrium . ablating only at one site identified a priori in persistent af , and seeing immediate slowing and termination of af is not known to have been performed previously . a 77 - year - old man presented for ablation of atrial fibrillation ( af ). his history was notable for paroxysmal af despite multiple antiarrhythmic medications , a slightly enlarged left atrium ( diameter 45 mm ) and normal left ventricular ejection fraction ( 58 %). at invasive electrophysiology study , catheters were inserted into the atria as described . the invention was applied to multiple sensors . fig1 a , panel 900 shows a localized source in the form of an electrical rotor near the left inferior pulmonary vein . inspection of panels 901 - 904 from left to right ( forwards in time ) shows that the depolarized ( activated ) tissue in warmer colors ( red (“ r ”)) revolves clockwise around a core region on the medial lip of the left inferior pulmonary vein ( see outline as black hourglass ). ablation at this site terminated af acutely . a 40 - year - old patient with persistent af presented for ablation . the af was resistant to flecainide and other anti - arrhythmic medications , his left atrial diameter was 52 mm and left ventricular ejection fraction was 69 %. at invasive electrophysiology study , catheters were inserted into the atria as described above . the invention was applied to multiple sensors . fig1 b , panels 911 - 914 show a localized source in the form of an electrical rotor in the posterior wall of the left atrium . again , viewing panels 911 - 914 from left to right shows that activated ( depolarized ) tissue revolves counter - clockwise around a core region on the posterior wall of the left atrium between the pulmonary veins . after ablation at this site , the patient remains free of af . to the best of the inventors &# 39 ; knowledge , these are the first actual demonstrations of the existence of electrical rotors in human af . a 56 - year - old patient with paroxysmal af and significant symptoms presented for ablation . the af continued despite several anti - arrhythmic medications . his left atrium was moderately enlarged . at invasive electrophysiology study , catheters were inserted into the atria as described above . the invention was applied to multiple sensors . panel 1610 of fig1 b show the output of a localized source in the left atrium , between the pulmonary veins although not lying at these veins . the source was repetitive , as indicated by arrow 1620 in fig1 a , right panel . the activation trail ( indicated by arrows 1630 ) shows activation emanating radially from this site . in panel 1640 of fig1 b , left atrial activation is seen to be fibrillatory ( disorganized ). ablation was applied to this focal beat cause , and af terminated acutely . this is a paradigm shifting , because normal ablation lesions in this patient that circle the pulmonary veins , would have missed this source . thus , this patient would likely have been one who would have recurred after ablation , if the prior art known techniques of treating af had been used . abreu

"the chromatographic stationary phases comprise an inorganic carrier onto which has been coated and crosslinked a layer of organic polymer . the inorganic carriers that may be used in the present invention include , but are not necessarily limited to silica , silica gels , glass , carbon bentonite , hydroxyapatite , zirconia , titania and alumina . the preferred carrier is alumina having a known average pore size , known particle size and known surface area . the primary requirement for the inorganic carriers is that they be essentially water insoluble and have sufficient surface area (& gt ; 5 m 2 / g ) for the coating of a sufficient amount of a sufficient amount of thin polymeric film . further details of carrier materials are found in the prior art , as for example u . s . pat . nos . 4 , 786 , 628 , 4 , 822 , 593 , and 4 , 045 , 353 , and the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference or in the book , &# 34 ; packing and stationary phases in chromatographic techniques &# 34 ; edited by k . k . unger ( marcel dekker , 1990 ). the organic polymers employed in the present invention include , but are not necessarily limited to the range of hycar reactive liquid polymers available from b . f . goodrich , inc . ( e . g . hycar 1300x40 , hycar 1300x43 , etc .). the primary practical requirements for the polymers are that they be easily solubilized to facilitate the coating process and that they possess chemical functionalities which allow crosslinking and / or chemical grafting reactions . in order to produce the stationary phases described here , a solution is prepared containing typically 5 - 50 % ( w / w relative to the weight of support being used ) of polymer in a suitable solvent ( e . g . tetrahydrofuran , ethyl acetate ). to the solution is also added any necessary radical initiators or stabilizers at a level of 0 - 13 % w / w . inorganic carrier , such as alumina , is added to the solution in a round - bottomed flask and shaken for several minutes . the solvent is then removed by evaporation at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator until the material is free - flowing . the polymer - coated support is then subjected to a crosslinking reaction using a free radical initiator ( e . g . dicumyl peroxide ) at elevated temperatures or by use of gamma irradiation from a 60 co source . after crosslinking , the materials are typically washed with 1 % glacial acetic in hexane or ethyl acetate followed by a wash with hexane . the washed material is then dried and packed into columns . specific details for particular stationary phases are included in examples 1 - 7 below . this example describes a process for coating of alumina with poly ( butadiene - acrylonitrile ) by irradiation . poly ( butadiene - acrylonitrile ) ( 25 g , hycar vtbnx ( 1300x43 ), b . f . goodrich co ., cleveland , ohio ) and dicumyl peroxide ( 2 . 5 g , polysciences , inc ., warrington , pa .) were dissolved in 500 ml of ethyl acetate . sonication aided the dissolution of the polymer . the slightly cloudy solution was added to a 1 - l round - bottomed flask containing 250 g of alumina powder ( 8 micron unisphere ® alumina , biotage , inc ., charlottesville , va .) and the suspension was shaken for 15 min . removal of solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure yielded a free - flowing powder . the flask containing the coated powder was placed near a 60 co array for 24 h . at a dosage rate of 2 × 10 5 rad / h . following irradiation , the sample was washed with ˜ 3 ml of a solution of hexane containing 1 % of acetic acid per gram of alumina and then with ˜ 3 ml of hexane per gram of alumina . the product was dried either at reduced pressure to give a free - flowing powder which was used to effect a range of separations by high - performance liquid chromatography as described in examples 2 - 4 . the ethyl acetate of this example can be replaced by other solvents , such as tetrahydrofuran , methyl ethyl ketone , or aromatic solvents , as well known to those skilled in the art . in this example , the exact total radiation dosage is not critical . increasing the total time of irradiation up to 7 days did not affect the subsequent chromatographic performance of the product . other 60 co sources could also be used advantageously . in this example , the solvents used to wash the product can be advantageously replaced by other solvents , such as ethyl acetate , and other solvents suitable for solubilizing poly ( butadieneacrylonitrile ) or dicumyl peroxide and their degradation products . it should be understood that additives other than dicumyl peroxide or no additives may be added to affect the crosslinking step . examples 6 and 8 illustrate that this generalization is possible . crosslinking can be achieved by means other than irradiation , such as thermal or photochemical treatment . example 5 illustrates the use of thermal crosslinking . a 3 . 5 g quantity of poly ( butadiene - acrylonitrile )- coated alumina prepared as in example 1 above was packed into a 4 . 6 mm i . d .× 250 mm stainless steel column using methanol at a pressure of 6000 psi . a test mixture consisting of theophylline , p - nitroaniline , methyl benzoate , phenetole , and o - xylene ( 1 mg / ml each in 50 % aqueous acetonitrile ) was prepared and injected onto the column . the test mixture components were eluted using a mobile phase of 45 % water and 55 % acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0 . 5 ml / min . the efficiency of the column was found to be 35 , 500 plates / meter with an o - xylene retention of 13 . 5 minutes . the ph of the water portion of the mobile phase was raised to 10 . 5 with aqueous ammonia and after operation at this ph for 24 hours the efficiency was found to be 35 , 200 plates / meter and the o - xylene retention 13 . 4 minutes . this represents & lt ; 1 % loss of retention and efficiency . these chromatographic measurements showing the high level of performance of the material at high ph are shown in fig1 a and 1b . the chromatographic performance of the material described in example 2 is further illustrated in figure . this chromatogram shows the separation of a mixture of macrolide antiobiotics and was generated using a mobile phase of 80 % 0 . 02m kh 2 po 4 20 % acetonitrile , apparent ph 10 . 9 and a flow rate of 1 . 2 ml / min . the samples chromatographed are indicated in the figure caption . after operation for 72 hours at ph 10 . 9 , the measured loss of column efficiency was found to be less than 1 %. the same column as was used in example 3 was used for the separation of a set of penicillins ( fig . 3 ) using a mobile phase of 72 % 0 . 015 - m phosphate buffer ( ph 3 . 0 ) and 28 % acetonitrile . thus the invention exhibits good stability over a wide ph range with good separation efficiency . this example describes a process for coating of alumina with poly ( butadiene - acrylonitrile ) by thermal treatment . 1 g of hycar vtbnx ( 1300x43 ) and 0 . 1 q of dicumyl peroxide were dissolved in 30 ml of ethyl acetate . the resulting solution was added to 10 g of 8 micron unisphere alumina in a 100 - ml round - bottomed flask and the suspension was shaken for 15 min removal of solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure yielded a free flowing powder . the powder was heated in an atmosphere of nitrogen at 110 ° c . for 30 minutes an then at 140 ° c . for 3 h . the reaction flask was allowed to cool to room temperature under a positive pressure of nitrogen and then washed and used to effect separations following example 2 . the retention time of o - xylene was 11 min . and the efficiency was 17 , 000 plates / meter . when the same alumina was coated with polybutadiene the retention time of o - xylene was 9 . 6 min . and the efficiency was 12 , 000 plates / meter . the procedure described in example 1 was carried out , except the reactants were 0 . 5 g of poly ( butadiene - acrylonitrile ), 0 . 5 g of allyl methacrylate and 5 g of alumina . the retention time of o - xylene was 14 . 1 min , and the efficiency was 25 , 000 plates / meter . this example showed that dicumyl peroxide may be replaced by other additives . a solution of 2 . 5 g of poly ( butadiene - acrylonitrile ), 0 . 25 g of dicumyl peroxide and 0 . 25 g of divinyl benzene in 175 ml of ethyl acetate was shaken with 25 g of 8 micron alumina powder for 10 min . following removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure , the material was irradiated using a 60 co source at 1 . 65 × 10 6 rad / h for 24 hr . the material was washed as follows : the sample was slurried in 200 ml of ethyl acetate and sonicated for 10 min . the solvent was removed by filtration using a bchuer funnel . this procedure was repeated and the material was then washed with 150 ml of hexane . the material was packed according to example 2 . the retention time of o - xylene was 16 min . this example 7 shows that the addition of other crosslinking agents can alter the characteristics of the material by altering retention times . hycar is a registered trademark of b . f . goodrich for butadiene homopolymers and butadiene / acrylonitrile copolymers . the isomer content is largely cis / trans with vinyl ( 1 , 2 addition of butadiene ) being 25 % or less . they have reactive groups in both terminal positions of the polymer chain and may have additional reactive groups pendent on the chain . some do not contain solvents or other unreactive components . the designator letter c indicates a carboxyl group , v indicates a vinyl group , a indicates an amine group , t indicates terminal reactive groups , b indicates butadiene , n indicates acrylonitrile and x indicates the presence of pendent reactive groups . the ct series of carboxyl terminated liquid polymers may be considered long chain dicarboxylyic acids having functionalities between 1 . 8 and 2 . 4 . the typical properties are as follows : ______________________________________hycar polymer 1300x8 ctbn 1300x13acrylonitrile % 18 26contentcarboxyl contentacid number 29 32ephr . 052 . 057brookfield viscosity 135 , 000 570 , 000mpa · s or cp , 27 ° solubility parameter 8 . 77 9 . 14based on molar attractionconstantsspecific gravity 0 . 948 . 96025 °/ 25 ° c . fuctionality 1 . 8 1 . 8molecular weight , mn 3 , 600 3 , 200______________________________________ the hycar vinyl terminated ( vt ) liquid polymers have reactive acrylate vinyl groups and can be reacted into systems involving cures by free radical mechanisms . the reactive vinyl group is separate from the cis / trans / vinyl unsaturation contributed by the polymerized butadiene of the polymer backbone . typical properties for the methacrylated polymer is as follows : ______________________________________hycar polymer 1300x43 vtbnxacrylonitrile % 21 . 5boundacid number max . 5brookfield viscosity 425 , 000mpa · s or cp , 27 ° specific gravity . 98125 °/ 25 ° c . solubility parameter 9 . 091______________________________________",1

of water while experiencing all of the benefits of free movement swimming . in order to provide these benefits structural components cooperate to perform various required functions . the required functions include placement restriction , lifting action and resilient motion . numerous structural arrangements are available to perform each of these functions and may be deployed in various combinations . an anchoring of the multiple part pole relative to the body of water , in combination with other structural components , provides for the desired placement restriction of the swimmer within the body of water . the lifting action provides the swimmer with the sensation of free swimming while being retained in a generally fixed location within the body of water . during performance of the swimming action the swimmer will be making the strokes associated with a specific swimming style in a repetitive manner . it being understood that many swimming styles may be utilized with the present invention . during performance of each stroke for any respective swimming style , as is true for conventional free swimming , various degrees of forward force will be applied by the swimmer within the water during a specific point within each of the strokes . during conventional free swimming these variations in propulsion force within each repetitive cycle of strokes would have no noticeable effect upon the swimmer . when the strokes are performed in a tethered manner it is desirable to provide for a certain degree of resilient motion at some location within the tether assembly to maintain a generally uniform pressure between the swimmer and the components of the assembly contacting the swimmer . while this resilient motion may be accommodated within various of the components , or even a combination of components , it has been discovered that the best component to provide this feature is the multiple part pole . additionally , it has been discovered that it is best to restrict this flex of the multiple part pole to the uppermost portion of the multiple part pole . this is accomplished in the preferred embodiment by providing a taper to the multiple part pole , as is conventionally known in fishing poles , where a diminishing of diametric measurement along the length of the multiple part pole restricts the flex to the outermost extent of the multiple part pole . of course , if desired , it is possible to provide certain portions of the multiple part pole to have a uniform diametric measurement rather than having a taper along the entire length of the multiple part pole . fig1 depicts a swimming exercise device 20 having a multiple part pole 22 , means to retain multiple part pole 22 , in the form of a pole mount 24 , an engagement member 26 and a connection member 28 . swimming exercise device 20 functions to allow a generally free movement of legs 30 and arms 32 of a swimmer 34 during performance of a swimming action 36 by swimmer 34 within a body of water 38 while swimmer 34 is being restricted to a generally stationary position 40 in body of water 38 . multiple part pole 22 , engagement member 26 and connection member 28 cooperate to provide for restriction of placement of swimmer 34 in body of water 38 during performance of swimming action 36 while further providing for a lifting action 42 to swimmer 34 while in body of water 38 during performance of swimming action 36 . the combination of location placement with the lifting action provides for an excellent exercise session which is extremely beneficial to overall health yet is both fun to perform and safe to perform . the present invention provides for swimmer 34 to be retained in stationary position 40 within body of water 38 , such as a swimming pool 44 , while also providing a certain amount of lift within swimming pool 44 during performance of swimming action 36 . to this end of providing for the retention in stationary position 40 multiple part pole 22 provides for securement to a fixed position relative to body of water 38 . multiple part pole 22 also provides for a certain amount of resilient motion , or flex , which is providing the resistance to swimmer 34 during performance of swimming action 36 . to the end of providing the lift during performance of the swimming action it is necessary to provide for elevation of a connection point 46 of multiple part pole 22 for connection member 28 above a surface 48 of swimming pool 44 . a multiple part pole will be provided which will perform several important functions . the multiple part pole will provide for an attachment location for the connection member elevated well above the surface of the body of water . this elevated attachment location in combination with an angle of the connection member will provide the desired lifting action to the swimmer during performance of the swimming action . additionally , a resilient flexibility of the multiple part pole will provide for resilient motion of swimmer 34 within swimming pool 44 . multiple part pole 22 has a securing end 50 , an outer end 52 and a resilient flexibility along a portion of multiple part pole 22 at least near outer end 52 . preferably , multiple part pole 22 has a gradual and consistent taper , as depicted , from securing end 50 to outer end 52 . multiple part pole 22 may be constructed from many suitable materials . multiple part pole 22 has at least two ( 2 ) portions which may be easily separated , see fig3 a and fig4 b , and easily attached , see fig3 a and fig4 a . fig7 and fig8 depict a

arrangements , also as conventionally known in the art . intermediate portion 190 has a has a length measurement 192 , see fig7 , which in the most preferred embodiment , is generally equal to length measurement 60 of first portion 56 and to length measurement 62 of second portion 58 . referring now to fig3 a and fig4 a which depict a preferred embodiment , first portion 56 of multiple part pole 22 has a first end 66 and a second end 68 . first end 66 of first portion 56 has a diametric measurement 70 . second end 68 of first portion 56 has a diametric measurement 72 . diametric measurement

. first end 74 of second portion 58 has a diametric measurement 78 . second end 76 of second portion 58 has a diametric measurement 80 . diametric measurement 78 of first end 74 of second portion 58 is greater than diametric measurement 80 of second end 76 of second portion 58 . diametric measurement 70 of first end 66 of first portion 56 is generally equal to diametric measurement 80 of second

198 . second end 196 of intermediate portion 190 has a diametric measurement 200 . diametric measurement 198 of first end 194 of intermediate portion 190 is greater than diametric measurement 200 of second end 196 of intermediate portion 190 . this tapering provides for intermediate portion 190 to have more flex near second end 196 . it is necessary to assemble and secure the various parts of the multiple part pole when the various sections are configured to be separated . many coupling and securing methods are known in the art to provide this required function and many of these methods and structures may be utilized with the present invention . when the parts are detachable it is possible to provide for mere contact to retain the parts together , such as a simple penetration coupling . alternatively , it is possible to provide for structures to securely retain the parts together . this retention can be as simple as a bayonet type coupling where a male part penetrates a female part and a rotational displacement locks the parts together . alternatively , the retention can be more complicated such as the opposing threaded couplings depicted in various of the views . fig3 a through fig6 depict a preferred embodiment for this coupling and securing where first portion 56 of multiple part pole 22 has a pole coupling end 82 and second portion 58 of multiple part pole 22 has a pole

securement coupling 86 and are securely retained utilizing first threaded member 92 of penetrate and securement coupling 86 and second threaded member 94 of penetrate and securement coupling 86 . pole coupling end 82 of first portion 56 and pole coupling end 84 of second portion 58 are retained in an extremely close orientation 96 when penetrate and securement coupling 86 is in a secured orientation 98 . fig7 and fig8 depict intermediate portion 190 of multiple part pole 22 having opposing portions of penetrate and securement coupling 202 having a male member 204 , a female member 206 , a first threaded member 208 and a second threaded member 210 . this arrangement provides for installation of intermediate portion 190 between first portion 56 and second portion 58 . in certain situations it is desirable to provide for an angular change between portions of the multiple part pole . various structures may be deployed to provide for the angular change . fig9 a and fig9 b depict an offset coupling 212 having a first coupling portion 214 and a second coupling portion 216 which are penetration type couplings . first coupling portion 214 slidingly receives a second coupling portion 218 of a lower pole portion 220 . second coupling portion 216 slidingly receives a first coupling portion 222 of an upper pole portion 224 . in the absence of use of offset coupling 212 second coupling portion 218 of lower pole portion 220 may mate with first coupling portion 222 of upper pole portion 224 . it is a requirement that some arrangement be provided to retain the securing end of the multiple part pole relative to the body of water . this may be provided by merely utilizing existing structures about the body of water or , more preferably , will involve providing dedicated structural components which will be fixedly secured , at least temporarily , about the body of water . it is possible to provide for at least the multiple part pole of the present invention to remain generally permanently positioned relative to the body of water even when not being utilized for performance of the swimming action . more preferably , the multiple part pole will be removed when not

"referring first to fig1 the organization of an electrosurgical device that could utilize the cutting signal generator of the present invention is illustrated . a power supply 11 supplies dc power to a switching device 15 by way of cable 13 . the switching device 15 may be mechanically or electromechanically actuated and is intercoupled electromechanically 31 with a switching device 29 at the output of a coagulating signal generator 21 and a cutting signal generator 23 . switching device 15 selectively supplies energy from the power supply to the coagulating signal generator 21 over cable 17 . the coagulating signal generator 21 may be a spark - gap oscillator that supplies high current , high frequency , damped oscillations over cable 25 to switching device 29 . switching device 29 may contain manually adjustable signal controls and path selection devices to , for example , switch the coagulating signal to line 33 . line 33 is then connected to a surgical instrument . line 39 may be connected to the grounding or &# 34 ; indifferent &# 34 ; plate , contacting the patient and acts as a return path for the electrosurgical signal . if a cutting signal is desired , switching device 15 supplies dc energy from the power supply 11 to the cutting signal generator 23 by way of cable 19 . the cutting signal generator 23 , as will be more fully explained hereinafter , is a medium frequency , high power oscillator - amplifier that generates a continuous signal . this signal is supplied to switching device 29 over cable 29 . switching device 29 connects this signal to a cutting terminal 35 which is connected to a surgical instrument ( not shown ). electrosurgical devices such as , illustrated by fig1 are well known in the prior art . the cutting signal generator 23 , illustrated in fig2 is uniquely designed to accommodate itself to the varying load conditions presented by the human body . the load 59 connected across the cutting signal generator output lines 27a , 27b may go from infinite impedance to zero impedance . however , practically speaking , when operating in the human body , the load can vary from several thousand ohms down to around 30 ohms . the cutting signal generator 23 comprises an npn transistor amplifier 53 shown to be configured in a commonemitter arrangement . the transistor amplifier is illustrated as being made up of one transistor . however , it should be understood that as many transistors as is necessary , connected in parallel , may be utilized to achieve the desired power output . the transistor amplifier 53 is connected as a regenerative feedback oscillator by way of a feedback transformer having a primary winding 41 and a secondary winding 43 . primary winding 47 of the load transformer is connected in series with the primary winding 41 of the feedback transformer . the secondary winding 45 of the load transformer is connected to the load 59 over output lines 27a , 27b . the transistor amplifier 53 is biased by a resistor 49 , which keeps the collector terminal at side 1 of resistor 49 positive with respect to the base at side 2 of the resistor 49 . it should be understood that this npn arrangement is only exemplary and that pnp transistors may be used as well , the biasing being rearranged appropriately . a dc voltage from the power supply 11 is supplied to side 1 of the primary winding 41 over line 19 . the secondary winding 43 of the transformer inversely couples the signal in the primary winding 41 to the base of transistor 53 by way of capacitor 51 . one side of the secondary winding 43 is grounded , while the other side is connected to one side of capacitor 51 . the emitter of the transistor 53 is also grounded . the primary winding 47 and secondary winding 45 couple the signal in the collector circuit of transistor 53 , without inversion , to the load . the effective inductance of the winding 43 in the feedback loop and the capacitance of capacitor 51 in the feedback loop determine the time constant of the regenerative feedback oscillator circuit illustrated . in other words , the frequency of the output signal is determined by the value of inductor 43 and the value of capacitor 51 . when a dc power source is supplied to terminal 1 of primary coil 41 , by way of line 19 , the polarity of the primary winding will be plus at terminal 1 and minus at terminal 2 . the polarity of primary winding 47 will be plus on top and minus on the bottom . the polarity of resistor 49 will be plus at terminal 1 and minus at terminal 2 . this will bias the transistor 53 in a forward direction causing base current 63 to start flowing . when such base current starts flowing , collector current 61 and emitter current 65 will also start flowing in the direction shown by the arrows . the base current illustrated is actually electron flow . it should be understood that conventional current flows in a direction opposite to electron flow . this electron flow causes an expanding electromagnetic field in primary windings 47 and 41 . the electromagnetic field caused by primary winding 41 is coupled to secondary winding 43 which is wound to cause polarity inversion . thereby , terminal 4 of winding 43 will be positive and terminal 3 will be negative when terminal 1 of primary winding 41 is positive and terminal 2 is negative . as electron flow increases in the collector circuit of transistor 53 , the current induced in secondary winding 43 , as a result of the expanding electromagnetic field in winding 41 , will cause a positive charge build - up on plate 1 of capacitor 51 . the other side or plate 2 of capacitor 51 will , therefore , have an increasing negative charge . this increasing negative charge at plate 2 acts to further bias the transistor 53 in the forward direction , causing an increase in base current 63 , which in turn causes an increase in collector current 61 and emitter current 65 . this action will continue until the collector current 61 reaches a maximum as determined by the elements 41 , 47 in the collector circuit and the transistor 53 . at such time , since the current is no longer increasing , lack of an electromagnetic flux change in the primary winding 41 causes a lack of feedback current , by way of inductor 43 and capacitor 51 . at such time , plate 1 of capacitor 51 has reached its maximum positive charge , as shown by the first half cycle of wave 55 . the opposite plate 2 of capacitor 51 , at this time has reached its maximum negative charge as shown by the first half cycle of wave 56 . the capacitor 51 will start discharging through inductor 43 to ground , according to the particular time constant dictated by the values of capacitor 51 and inductor 43 . this discharge action causes the base current 63 to decrease , thereby decreasing the collector current 61 and the emitter current 65 of transistor 53 . since the collector current is now collapsing , the feedback coupling between primary winding 41 and the secondary winding 43 , will aid this process , causing the capacitor to discharge until the transistor 53 is driven to cut - off as exhibited by practically zero emitter current and collector current . at this time , plate 1 of capacitor 51 has reached its maximum negative charge , as shown by the second half cycle of wave 53 . the other plate 2 of capacitor 51 has , in turn reached its maximum positive charge , as shown by the second half cycle of wave 56 . the biasing resistor 49 maintains the transistor in a forward bias condition , thereby causing base current 63 to again increase , in turn increasing emitter current 65 and collector current 61 . this action causes a repeat of the first half cycle , as shown by waves 55 and 56 . oscillation will continue in this manner until removal of the dc supply from side 1 of the primary winding 41 of the feedback transformer . the primary winding 47 and the secondary winding 45 couple the load 59 into the collector circuit of the transistor 53 . what in effect occurs by this arrangement , is the load impedance of the load 59 is reflected back into the primary 47 of the transformer so that , effectively , primary winding 47 may be replaced by the reflected impedance value of the load . therefore , primary winding 47 , secondary winding 45 and the load 59 can be thought of as a variable impedance in the collector circuit . bearing this in mind , it can be seen that as the value of the load impedance in the collector circuit of transistor 53 decreases , the collector current will increase . assuming that the collector current 61 is in the increasing part of its cycle , a decreasing load impedance will tend to increase the collector current causing the voltage drop across the primary winding 41 to become larger . this increasing voltage drop is coupled from the primary winding 41 to the secondary winding 43 , which in turn increases the feedback signal to the capacitor 51 thereby further forwarding biasing the transistor 53 . this increased forward biasing increases the base current 63 , the collector current 61 and the emitter current 65 . the increasing collector current will compensate commensurately for the decreasing reflected impedance of the load to keep the voltage across the load from swinging sharply to a value below the desired minimum . assume now that the load impedance is increasing and the collector current is in an increasing cycle . the increasing impedance will cause the collector current to decrease . this causes the voltage drop across the primary winding 41 to decrease correspondingly , thereby decreasing the feedback signal and causing the charge on capacitor 51 to decrease . this decreases the forward bias of the transistor 53 which causes a decrease in the base current 63 and a commensurate decrease in the collector current 61 . here , the combination of a decreasing collector current with an increasing reflected load impedance keeps the voltage across the load from swinging sharply to a value above the desired maximum . besides stabilizing the voltage swings across the load , the oscillator of fig2 controls the change in current through the load , thereby also preventing erratic swings in load current . in summary , what has been disclosed is an electrosurgical device that utilizes an uncomplicated and inexpensive oscillator - amplifier circuit for generating tissue cutting signals . the oscillator - amplifier is designed to inexpensively adapt itself to impedance changes of the load . obviously , many modifications and variations of the foregoing disclosure , as illustrated by the preferred embodiment , are possible in light of the above teachings . it is , therefore , to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described .",0
"in conjunction with the description of the preferred embodiment , a web offset printing press will be described . it should be noted , however , that the invention can be utilized on printing presses other than web offset presses . referring to fig1 , a color registration control system 100 is shown and includes a scanning unit or camera assembly 102 and an associated transport system 104 . the transport system 104 can be of a manual or automated design . preferably , an automated design is used such as is known in the art . generally , an automated transport system can include a linear actuator and a motor with a motor controller . the actuator consists of a bar , carriage , coupling mechanism , transport mechanism ( e . g . screw or belt ), and position encoder . optionally , the transport system 104 may also include limit switches , jog buttons ( to allow the operator to move the carriage ), and indicators such as the direction it is moving and whether or not the camera assembly 102 is tracking the register marks . however , it should be noted that other suitable transport mechanisms can also be employed to provide mobility to the camera assembly 102 . the camera assembly 102 takes an acquisition - on - demand image of a web 106 of a printing press 108 and processes the image within the camera assembly 102 . the camera assembly 102 will be described hereafter in operation in conjunction with a color registration control system 100 and color registration controller 110 of a web offset printing press . however , it should be noted that the camera assembly 102 can be utilized on other types of printing presses and in other printing press control systems wherein an image of the moving web is needed such as in ink density color control , cutoff control , ribbon or sidelay control , fanout and cocking control , and web inspection . referring now to fig2 , the camera assembly 102 is shown in detail . the camera assembly 102 includes an outer housing or case 204 . ribs 206 on the housing are utilized to dissipate heat . the camera assembly 102 defines a self - contained package for processing images of the web in a small footprint , in contrast to the scanning function being in one location and the processing in another remote location with a video cable connection therebetween . by including the scanning and processing components all within a single housing or package , the difficulty of transmitting the image data is eliminated and distortion and degradation problems of the image data are significantly reduced . preferably , the housing has width dimension of 4 ″ or smaller . the components contained within the housing 204 of the camera assembly include a light source 208 , an optics assembly 210 , a power supply and interface board 212 , an image sensor 214 on a sensor board 216 , and a main board 218 . with respect to the light source 208 , preferably the light source is a single source and more preferably a strobe light source . a strobe light source freezes the motion of the moving web by firing with a short duration . it should be noted , however , that other light sources such as a strobed set of leds could also be employed . in the preferred embodiment , a strobe illumination assembly 208 is utilized . the assembly 208 includes a strobe bulb 220 , such as a xenon strobe bulb , a high voltage power supply 222 , and a strobe trigger 223 ( fig9 ). when the strobe bulb 220 is fired , the energy in a capacitor is controllable and is transferred into the bulb 220 . the strobe power supply 222 used in the preferred embodiment has a low - voltage trim input that is used to set the capacitor voltage . the low - voltage trim input is further controlled with a d / a converter . with respect to the optics assembly 210 , preferably the assembly 210 includes a lens 224 and a mirror assembly 226 . the lens 224 is for example a f 7 adjustable focus lens having a focal length of approximately 21 mm . as best shown in fig3 and 4 , the mirror assembly 226 includes two flat mirrors 228 , 230 positioned as shown . it should be noted that the mirrors 228 , 230 could have other configurations other than flat such as , for example , concave mirrors . the mirrors are front silvered to eliminate the problem of ghost images and are attached to a mounting housing with an adhesive such as glue or preferably a double - sided adhesive tape . the mounting housing includes stops to aid in the location of the mirrors upon assembly . as best shown in fig5 a and 5b , the mirrors redirect light from the strobe bulb 220 located in - between and , preferably , above the mirrors so that the light is in the same plane as the imaging axis ( lens axis ), that plane being normal to the curved surface of the idler and intersecting the rotational axis of the idler . the mirrors are spaced far enough apart so that no specularly reflected incident light ray will enter the lens 224 and cause glare . the lens 224 is symmetrical about a vertical plane that is orthogonal to the plane in which the incident light and lens axis occur , the intersection of these two planes being a line that is coincident with the lens axis . this symmetry provides uniformity of illumination from each mirror 228 , 230 as such , the mirrors 228 , 230 are designed to receive light from the single light source and create dual light paths of substantially uniform illumination directed toward the web 106 of the printing press 108 as is shown fig5 a and 5b . with the use of a single light source , light source illumination characteristics do not have to be matched to approximate uniform illumination . further , the cost of supply and replacement of a single light source , as compared to a dual light source implementation , is reduced by half . the mirror assembly 226 enables a dual light path to be created with each path being at substantially the same illumination level . the single source / mirror combination also enables the housing 204 of the camera assembly 102 to be of a reduced width dimension enabling the camera assembly 102 to be positioned in locations not otherwise accessible , such as at the web extremities . the smaller profile camera assembly 102 can be positioned at the extremity of the web 106 and not be interfered with by the sideframe of the printing press 108 . referring now to the power supply and interface board 212 within the housing 204 of the camera assembly 102 , it includes a conventional low voltage power supply and conventional communication interfaces . with respect to the image sensor 214 , preferably a ccd area scanner is utilized such as an image sensing device available from texas instruments as model ti tc237b . it would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other devices such as a cmos image sensor may also be used . the sensor board 216 includes drivers , the image sensor 214 and a ccd signal processor ( csp ) 516 as shown in fig9 as will be described hereafter . in general operation and with reference back to fig1 , the camera assembly 102 functions as follows . upon receipt of an activation signal , the strobe illumination assembly 208 is activated and illuminates the web 106 as shown by arrow a . the reflected light off the web 106 , as shown by arrow b , is received by the image sensor 214 and the resulting image data is processed within the camera assembly 102 . after processing , if it is determined that the camera assembly 102 should be positioned in a different location , such as when searching for color register marks , a move request and a web position are sent to the transport system 104 . the transport system 104 then re - positions the camera assembly 102 either manually or automatically . for example , if automated , the transport system 104 allows an automatic , controlled side - to - side movement . if , however , the transport system 104 is to be operated manually , a status indicator can be activated to indicate to an operator a direction in which to move the camera assembly 102 . the register error , even if zero , will be reported to the color registration controller 110 . an operator can then access the register error and other information such as the system configuration and setup , troubleshoot , or track system operation through an operator control station 112 . referring now to fig6 , typical predefined color register marks 300 , 302 and 304 are shown in a 50 : 1 scale . the mark 304 is preferably used with the present invention and is 0 . 010 ″ to scale . however , it should be noted that other predefined and programmable register marks can be used as will be explained in detail hereafter . fig7 illustrates an exemplary predefined register mark pattern 306 . specifically , in order to control color register , the control system 100 needs to measure the position of the printed color register marks relative to each other , and to correct for any erroneous positions . to measure the positions of color register marks , a plurality of register marks in a register mark pattern 306 are printed on the web 106 such as the exemplary pattern 306 shown in fig7 . the pattern 306 includes four marks of one ink color and one mark of each of the other three ink colors , however , other patterns can also be utilized . ideally , if the printed color register marks match the predefined pattern 306 , color is in register . the camera assembly 102 locates and measures the relationship of the printed marks of each color relative to each other and relative to the predefined pattern 306 . the difference between the locations measured by the camera assembly 102 and the predefined pattern 306 is considered a register error . the procedure then includes sampling the printed marks at a mark sampling rate , e . g . five shots per second , filtering the resulting register error samples , and feeding the register error samples to a control algorithm . the control algorithm then decides how to correct the error . the printing press 108 includes a plurality of register motors that allow small lateral and circumferential adjustments of the printing cylinder relative to the rest of the printing press . the color registration controller 110 performs the error adjustments as is known in the art . even if the printed mark pattern perfectly matches the predefined format 306 , there still might be a residual error . residual error is often generated as a result of plate mounting errors or plate errors introduced in the manufacturing process . an operator measures that error manually and enters an offset into the controller 110 to compensate for the error . thereafter , the controller 110 is enabled to control the corrected ( offset ) pattern . turning now to fig8 , the main circuit board 218 of the camera assembly 102 is shown schematically . the main board 218 includes a processor 400 , preferably an embedded microprocessor such as the 32 - bit motorola coldfire mcf5307 , and a memory module 402 for data and instruction storage . the memory module 402 is operatively coupled to the processor 400 and it further includes a sdram module 404 such as two micron manufacturing mt48lc4m16atg - 75 sdrams , and a field - re - programmable nonvolatile storage / flash memory module 406 such as an intel te28f160c3ba90 flash memory . the sdram module 404 provides , in general , run - time storage of all software instructions and data , whereas the flash memory module 406 stores an operating system , a plurality of fpga bit files , a plurality of configuration parameters , a plurality of diagnostic logs and application executables . it would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other memory devices such as a dram , a ddr sdram ( double data rate sdram ), a rambus dram , a high speed sram , or the like may also be used . the processor 400 is also operatively coupled to a hardware image processing ( hip ) fpga module 410 such as a xilinx xcv100e fpga , and a video head subsystem ( vhs ) fpga module 412 such as a xilinx xcs30xl fpga which interfaces between the processor 400 and the sensor board 216 . it would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other devices such as an asic , a cpld , a pld , a dedicated image processing hardware offered by sumitomo metals , a processor with fpga or cpld structure built in , or the like may be used in instead of the fpgas . the processor 400 includes a dma controller 422 as will be explained in more detail below . the main board 218 also includes a lan interface module 414 . the lan interface module 414 includes an ethernet lan controller 416 such as a crystal / cirrus cs8900a isa bus ethernet lan controller ( which provides 10baset connectivity for the camera assembly ) and a lan controller interface ( cpld ) 418 such as a xilinx xc95144xl - 10tq144i . turning now to fig9 , the vhs fpga module 412 and the main components of the sensor board 216 are illustrated . the vhs fpga module 412 includes a plurality of controls and interfaces , such as an encoder interface 502 , a processor interface 504 , an image acquisition control 506 , and a video dma interface 508 . the vhs fpga module 412 generates all of the signals that the sensor board 216 needs in order to operate . the vhs fpga module 412 also functions to interface to an optical rotary encoder 114 ( fig1 ) on the printing press 108 and take an image of the web 106 at a specified location . specifically , the encoder 114 is operatively coupled to the printing press as is known in the art . the encoder 114 provides an indication of the circumferential position of a printing plate and provides high resolution rotational position information directly to or via a position input multiplexer 116 ( fig1 ) to the camera assembly 102 . images of the web 106 are then taken at different circumferential positions by choosing different encoder pulse counts at which the images are taken . based on demand , the processor 400 initiates an image acquisition process , and specifies an encoder pulse count at which an image of the web 106 is taken that corresponds to the desired image . the encoder interface 502 then generates a trigger signal at the encoder pulse count specified by the processor 400 . the encoder interface 502 then signals the image acquisition control 506 to activate the strobe illumination assembly 208 . when the web 106 is illuminated , the reflected light from the web 106 is detected by the lens 224 and the image sensor 214 . in the preferred embodiment , the image sensor 214 is driven by a driver circuit 514 with drivers such as elantec el7202 high speed dual channel power mosfet drivers . the image sensor 214 , located on the sensor board 216 and controlled by the image acquisition control 506 , retains the image in analog form and provides the image as a serial stream of pixels to a ccd signal processor ( csp ) 516 or an image digitizer such as a exar xr98l55 , also located on the sensor board 216 . the csp 516 subsequently converts each pixel to a 8 - bit digital output at a 12 . 5 mhz rate . particularly , the vhs fpga module 412 buffers up the image data ( typically a stream of 8 - bit pixels ) coming back from the sensor board 216 in the video dma interface 508 . when the dma interface 508 has 16 bytes , it issues a dma request to the processor 400 . the dma controller 422 of the processor 400 services the dma request and conducts a burst read of the image data off the vhs fpga module 412 followed by a burst write to the sdram 404 , in either a single address access mode or a dual address access mode , where the single address mode is preferred . the vhs fpga module 412 keeps requesting dma transfers until eventually a full image has been read out and transferred into the sdram 404 via the video dma interface 508 . to solve the problems of synchronization , the vhs fpga module 412 takes direct control of the scanning function by providing an image acquisition - on - demand ability while keeping the image sensor 214 relatively free of charge . if the scanner is allowed to remain idle without being read out , the image sensor 214 would slowly integrate the ambient light and dark current until becoming saturated . in the preferred embodiment , the vhs fpga module 412 includes the auto - clearing mode referring to the period when the vhs fpga module 412 is waiting to be notified to take an image . depending upon the specific image sensor 214 used , pulses should be provided to keep the image areas and storage area clear . depending upon the type of csp 516 used , a steady stream of dark pixels should be provided to maintain a plurality of biases . the auto - clearing mode can be interrupted at any time when an image needs to be taken . when a signal is received to take an image , the auto - clearing mode is stopped , and an integration mode / period is entered . after the integration period is entered , the strobe trigger 223 and the strobe bulb 220 are activated . after the integration period , the vhs fpga module 412 transfers the frame image data from the image area to its storage area , and the data is read out one line at a time . the vhs fpga module 412 also provides the high - speed dma interface 508 to the processor 400 with the processor 400 including the dma controller 422 with a plurality of channels . the dma channels are run in a cycle - stealing mode in which each dma request executes a single transfer of data , e . g . 16 bytes . in traditional non - cycle - stealing - dma , the dma controller 422 is programmed with a source address , a destination address , a count of the bytes in the overall transfer , and a size of each cycle in the transfer . when a dma transfer occurs , the dma controller 422 executes as many cycles as it needs to contiguously complete the entire transfer . when the dma executes the entire transfer at once , a buffer as large as the entire image is required until the image is completely read out of the image sensor 214 , and buffers of such size can increase cost of the system . cycle - stealing dma , in contrast , executes only a single cycle of sixteen bytes every time a dma request is serviced . the vhs fpga module 412 buffers only 16 bytes before it asserts the dma request and then the dma controller 422 steals a bus cycle in order to perform the transfer of data . saving a full image before executing the dma transfer would require an external ram . instead , the preferred embodiment uses a small first - in - first - out ( fifo ) module that can store enough bytes in order to buffer the bytes that are acquired while waiting for the dma controller 422 to respond to a previous request . in one embodiment as an example , the vhs fpga module 412 reads pixels out of the image sensor 214 at 12 . 5 mhz , approximately one pixel every 80 ns , and therefore , sixteen pixels are ready every 1280 ns . executing the dma cycle takes about 7 bus clocks meaning that the vhs fpga module 412 will need about 7 bus clocks × 22 ns = 154 ns of the bus every 1280 ns which is about 12 % of the processor bus bandwidth . in the preferred embodiment , and because the vhs fpga module 412 is basically re - programmable , the fpga design can be adapted or changed very easily to match up with different image sensors . for example , if a cmos image sensor technology is utilized , program changes are necessary at the vhs fpga module 412 in order that it is able to interface to the cmos devices without changing the main board 218 layout . referring now to fig1 , the hip fpga module 410 is shown and includes a dma interface 602 , a pixel histogrammer 604 , a binary correlator 606 , a correlation value histogrammer 608 , a binarizer 610 , a processor interface 612 , and a dma request arbiter 614 . the dma interface 602 is responsible for getting data from the bus . dma data is transferred via high - speed cycle - stealing burst transfers . details of the dma interface 602 are discussed hereinafter . the pixel histogrammer 604 runs on the vhs dma channel and calculates a gray scale histogram each time that the vhs fpga module 412 transfers an image into sdram 404 . the gray scale histogram is used to set the binarization level or the initial conditions of the binarizer 610 , which binarizes the image pixel value to 0 or 1 . the binary correlator 606 includes a correlator and all the logic used to run it and store its results . it can be run on the vhs dma channel or its own dma channel , depending upon how it is programmed . the correlation value histogrammer 608 creates a histogram of the correlation values when the binary correlator 606 is run . the correlation value histogrammer 608 is also used in the event that the correlator 606 produces no or few results , or if the correlator 606 results overflow . it can then be used to calculate an appropriate correlation threshold that could be used on a recorrelation to get a satisfactory number of correlation results . the processor interface 612 is preferably responsible for decoding the processor read , write , and interrupt acknowledge bus cycles , and for recognizing and handling an overall timing of these cycles . part of the address decoding of write cycles occurs within the processor interface 612 . additional decoding is also performed , where appropriate , within other blocks in the hip fpga module 410 , and when the other block has more than one register or a ram with more than one address location . specifically , the dma interface 602 further includes a dma cycle decoder 618 , a histogrammer dma interface 620 , and a correlator dma interface 622 . in an alternative embodiment , the interfaces are dma channel - centric instead of image processing tool - centric . this would approach the histogrammer dma interface 620 and the correlator dma interface 622 with both the first dma channel interface and a dma second channel interface . the main goal of the dma cycle decoder 618 is to look at input signals that indicate whether a dma cycle is occurring and then generate output signals that bracket when the sdram data is valid on the internal data bus so that it can be saved into fifos in the histogrammer and the correlator dma interfaces 620 , 622 respectively . the interface 602 also generates an additional signal for the correlator dma interface 622 to indicate the end of a dma transfer intended for the correlator . common features of the histogrammer and correlator dma interfaces 620 , 622 are a dma fifo with status indication , a fifo read control state machine , and a means to convert from a 4 pixel wide data stream to a 1 pixel wide data stream . the dma fifo is preferably a 64 bit deep by 32 bit wide ( four pixel ) fifo that is operatively coupled to the synchronized internal copy of the processor data bus . the write enable of each dma fifo is fed by the dma cycle decoder data detector 618 . when a dma cycle occurs , the sixteen pixels ( 4 clocks of 4 pixels each ) are saved in the dma fifo . the dma fifo has status outputs that indicate whether it is empty or full . in this case , the dma fifo is considered full if it cannot accept another full dma transfer of sixteen pixels . thus , the dma fifo is considered full if it has more than 48 pixels in it . whenever the dma fifo is not empty , the fifo read control state machine reads out an entry ( e . g . 32 bits , or 4 pixels ) from the dma fifo and generates the proper select signals to conversion means . working together the fifo read control state machine and the conversion means serialize the four packed pixels into a stream of single pixels . this stream of signal pixels can be fed as the input to either the correlator 606 or the histogrammer 604 . the fifo read control state machine also generates a “ valid data ” output that indicates when the stream of single pixels is active . this signal is intended as an enable for the correlator 606 or histogrammer 604 . finally , the dma interface 602 provides a signal that indicates when it is empty , an indicator that it has no more data in its dma fifo being serialized by the fifo read control state machine and the multiplexer . other additional features of the correlator dma interface 622 includes a dma counter and a dma request state machine . the dma counter is preferably programmed with the number of transfers that will occur in the overall dma transfer ( typically a full image ). when the binary correlator 606 is running on its own dma channel , the dma request state machine will generate a dma request to the processor whenever the correlator dma fifo is not full . the dma counter indicates there are more transfers required , and there are no outstanding dma requests , its previous requests have been acknowledged . additionally , the dma interface empty signal for the correlator dma interface 622 will not be asserted unless the dma counter indicates there are no more transfers required . the pixel histogrammer 604 further includes an input multiplexer 624 , a dual - port block ram 626 ( preferably of size 256 × 19 bit ), an incrementer 628 , and a plurality of flip - flops to delay key signals . the input multiplexer 624 decides whether the histogram pixel input or the processor address should access the block ram 626 . when the histogrammer 604 is enabled , the pixel input addresses the block ram 626 . however , when the histogrammer 604 is disabled , the processor 400 can address the block ram 626 in order to read and write from the ram 626 . prior to starting a histogram , all of the locations in the block ram 626 are preferably cleared . when the histogrammer 604 is enabled , each pixel addresses the block ram 626 . this causes the ram entry for that pixel to be read out . that value is then incremented and stored back into the block ram 626 on the other port . the timing is designed to make sure that the incremented value is saved before the next pixel arrives . that allows for two pixels in a row to be the same without causing a problem . turning to the binary correlator 606 , it preferably includes a row storage element 632 , a 16 × 16 pixel binary correlator 634 , a correlator location tracker and decoder module 636 , a correlation thresholder 638 , a correlation peak ram address counter 640 and a correlation peak ram 642 . generally , the binary correlator 606 provides a high - speed hardware - based means of searching for register marks in an image . the binary correlator 606 uses a 16 × 16 kernel which contains a binary image of the register mark . the correlator 606 binarizes the image and , in effect , passes a template over the entire image . for each possible template location within the image , the correlator 606 computes the correlation between the template and the image . locations with a correlation value higher than a programmable threshold are saved . turning now to fig1 , the binary correlator is shown in more detail . the binary correlator receives 8 - bit image data from the dma interface at arrow a . the hip fpga module 410 binarizes the image with the binarizer 610 , and passes that data into a 16 × 16 correlator 634 . the data enters the lower right comer of the correlator 634 . with each new pixel , the data in the correlator 634 is shifted to the left , effectively moving the template to the right within the image . as data passes out of the left edge of the template , it is sent to the row - storage memory element 632 . the row - storage size is fixed at 15 × 640 , which limits the operation of the correlator 634 to images that are 656 pixels wide . in an alternative embodiment , the row - storage size is made variable . the correlation value is calculated at each template location . if the correlation value meets or exceeds the correlation threshold stored in the correlation thresholder 638 and the template is within the area of interest in the image , the correlation and template location are saved in the correlation peak ram 642 . the template position tracker 636 contains a row and column counter to track the position of the lower right corner of the template . it also contains registers that define the area of interest . the correlation peak ram address counter 640 increments when each peak is stored in ram 642 . the correlation peak ram 642 preferably stores 1024 entries . the correlator 634 uses a kernel , the image data , and a kernel mask to calculate the binary correlation . for example , the kernel is a 16 × 16 square that contains a binary representation of a golden template mark . the mask is used to specify which pixels within the 16 × 16 square will be used for correlation and which pixels will be ignored . the image data is a 16 × 16 section of the image that is being correlated upon . in general , binary correlation is simply counting the number of bits within the image data that match the bits in the template . bits that are masked out are ignored . on a pixel by pixel basis , the logic function is : one way to implement the correlation function is to build the mask and kernel each out of sixteen 16 - bit registers , one register for each row . the image data is held in sixteen 16 - bit shift registers to facilitate moving the kernel across the image . in each kernel location , the correlation logic function is applied combinatorially on a per - pixel basis to all pixels in the template . the number of matching bits is added with some type of adder tree . with this implementation , the mask and kernel will each be programmed with a binary bitmap . the preferred embodiment uses look up tables storing the image data in sixteen 16 - bit shift registers , one for each row of the kernel . one row , and the associated logic , is shown in fig1 . each 4 - bit nibble of each shift register feeds a 16 × 3 look up table . each nibble represents one 4 - bit segment of the overall kernel . the shape , correlation function , and mask appropriate for each nibble must be programmed into the look up table . the outputs of all nibble look up tables are added together within rows to compute row correlations . the partial sums for all kernel - row correlators are added together for one overall correlation result . with the look - up - table implementation , the shape of the template mark , the mask , even the correlation function , are all programmed within the look - up - tables . in essence , the preferred binary correlator is a look - up - table based image processor that sums up its look - up - table results . turning back to fig6 and 7 , predefined color register marks 304 and pattern 306 are illustrated . however , as earlier noted , the invention supports the use of programmable color register marks . these marks and patterns can therefore be defined and designed by the used to suit individual application , and allow flexibility . referring now to fig1 , a state diagram of the registration control system 100 according to the present invention . as long as a transport system 146 ( 104 of fig1 ) is not moving , and the press 108 ( fig1 ) is above a minimum speed , an acquisition manager 150 starts to request a plurality of search areas from the search controller 152 , and starts to examine one search area at a time . the search controller 152 then uses the present encoder position , and the press speed ( along with a list of search areas that have been searched ) to pick the next desired area ( out of the list the search areas that have not been searched ) at which the camera assembly 102 is to take a picture . the acquisition manager 150 simultaneously programs an image acquisition at the search area by a plurality of programming steps . these steps include programming the vhs 154 ( 412 of fig8 ) with an acquisition request that provides the encoder count for the picture , programming a hip pixel histogrammer 156 ( 410 of fig8 ) to run on the image as it is unloaded from the vhs 154 , and programming a dma controller 158 ( 422 of fig8 ) to conduct the data transfer for acquisition . the vhs 154 then waits for the encoder 148 to reach the proper area by counting a series of encoder pulses . the vhs 154 sends a pulse to the strobe trigger 223 ( fig9 ), and the strobe bulb 220 is then activated to illuminate the web 106 . the reflected image of the illuminated web is detected by the sensor 214 . the vhs 154 in conjunction with the dma controller 158 then begin the transfer of image to memory , while a histogram is computed on the image by the hip 156 . the dma controller 158 signals the acquisition manager 150 when the full image is acquired and stored in memory . the acquisition manager 150 then signals a software image processor 160 that a new image has been acquired . meanwhile the acquisition manager 150 repeats the step of requesting the next desired search area discussed earlier . the software image processor 160 obtains the results from the hip histogrammer , and calculates a plurality of initial conditions for a hip binarizer 162 ( 610 fig1 ) based upon the histogram obtained . the software image processor 160 then programs the hip binary correlator 164 with data needed to run the correlation , the binarizer 162 with the initial conditions , and the dma controller 158 to conduct the data transfer for the hip 156 . the software image processor 160 then waits for the binary correlator 164 to be complete . once the hip binary correlator 164 completes the binary correlation 164 , it then notifies the software image processor 160 . the software image processor 160 then obtains the correlation results from the hip binary correlator 164 , and releases the hip to process the next image . the software image processor 160 also uses the correlation results and grayscale image data to search for the marks . the software image processor 160 notifies the search controller 152 of image processing results based on a plurality of pattern recognition results . if a partial pattern is found , the search controller 152 moves the transport system 146 to determine if a full pattern is found . if a full pattern is found , the search controller 152 stops searching circumferentially and starts tracking on it . if no pattern is found , the search controller 152 continues the circumferential search .",6

"in the following , the technology describe herein will be described with reference to exemplary and non - limiting embodiments of a new x - ray optics device based on a three dimensional prism structure or arrangement utilizing both refraction and diffraction for shaping the incoming x - ray flux . in particular , the invention offers a solution to the challenges in state - of - the - art x - ray optics by offering means for efficient two dimensional focusing of x - rays with energy above around 10 kev with a device that is easy to align , handle and produce . fig1 a illustrates an example of a device including a multitude of prisms which are traversed by incoming x - rays . the prisms ( 1 a ) are preferably arranged in one or more layers along an axis of symmetry , the so called optical axis ( 1 b ), and for x - rays entering substantially parallel to the optical axis there will be a focusing effect . the device will also work for x - rays entering the lens which are not entirely parallel to the optical axis , in this case with a slight reduction in the efficiency . as shown in fig1 b , the orientation of the “ lens ” is preferably such that the flat back of the prisms ( 1 c ) is oriented to be substantially parallel to the optical axis , the obtuse corner ( 1 d ) is pointing in substantially right angle to the optical axis while the sharp angles ( 1 e ) is pointing substantially along the optical axis 1 a . the number of prisms in cross - section ( i . e . orthogonal to the optical axis ) changes when moving along the optical axis and a corresponding void also changes in diameter . the reason is that x - rays further away from the optical axis requires more deflection than x - rays close to the optical axis . the prisms are arranged in such a way to achieve the desired focusing effects which is in turn decided by the amount of material and the number of surfaces traversed by any single x - ray . the three - dimensional prism structure is thus arranged such that x - rays further away from the optical axis will traverse more prisms than x - rays close to the optical axis . the optimum design of the device will depend on the x - ray energy and has to be decided through experiments and / or calculations in each case . typically , mechanical support structures are included to hold the individual prisms . it is beneficial to make the prisms and / or the support structures out of plastic or any other material which is mainly transparent to x - rays . it should be understood that the number of prisms is normally relatively large , compared to the schematic diagrams of fig1 a - b . an example of a more realistic configuration is shown in fig1 c , which illustrates part of an exemplary three - dimensional prism arrangement . as an example , for an optimum effect at around 27 kev the length of each prism ( 1 f ) should be around 140 micrometers while the height ( 1 g ) should be around 7 micrometers . in a particular exemplary realization , the number of prisms orthogonally to the optical axis may be around 60 and the number of prisms along the optical axis may be around 230 , yielding an outer diameter of the device of around 0 . 5 millimeters and a length of about 33 millimeters , including support structures . one may think that increasing the diameter of the device would yield an increase in the so called aperture and a corresponding increase in collecting incoming x - rays but this is not the case since the absorption will increase towards the edges and approaches one hundred percent . increasing the diameter beyond what is indicated in the example above for 27 kev will for example be less useful . in general x - ray absorption in the device decreases its efficiency and to minimize this effect a light element of low atomic number should be used , as for example a polymer made of hydrogen , oxygen and carbon . the prisms should be fabricated to high surface finish and form tolerance to work well . since ideal structures may be hard to manufacture , one or more of a number of practical approaches may be taken : 1 ) divide the device in discs or slices along the optical axis . 2 ) make these ( ideally circular ) discs not circular but hexagonal or other shapes . it should thus be understood that the discs are not necessarily circular , but may have other forms . 3 ) sub - dividing the discs into sectors . 4 ) divide the device in layers orthogonally to the optical axis . 5 ) divide the individual prisms in two or more parts to be assembled later . 6 ) introduce a radius for the edges of the prisms — they will not be infinitely sharp . 7 ) introduce space between the individual prisms and rearrange them while keeping the projected amount of material and the number of prism surfaces traversed as seen by the incoming x - rays . 8 ) add material to mechanically support the individual prisms . in a preferred exemplary embodiment of the device , as mentioned above , it can be built from slices such as discs or plates arranged or assembled side by side along the optical axis according to fig2 a . a corresponding cross - section view is illustrated in fig2 b . each disc preferably has a rotationally symmetric or near - symmetric ( e . g . hexagonal ) form , and accordingly the overall prism arrangement also has a rotationally symmetric or near - symmetric ( e . g . hexagonal ) form . the discs arranged along the optical axis are preferably grouped , and the number of prisms ( seen in a direction orthogonal to the optical axis ) in a first group of discs generally differs from the number of prisms in a second group of discs . in this way , the number of prisms in cross section ( i . e . orthogonal to the optical axis ) will be different at different positions along the optical axis . in addition , the distance of a given layer of prisms in relation to the optical axis may differ between different discs within a group of discs , as can be seen from fig2 c . it should though be understood that the groups , having the same number of prisms in a direction orthogonal to the optical axis , may be re - arranged in any arbitrary order along the optical axis . in fact , the discs may optionally be arranged in any arbitrary order , without any concept of groups . each disc may have one or more layers of at least one prism . with many layers , each layer typically has one or more prisms . it is even possible to build discs that contain only a fraction of a prism . preferably , however , an entire prism or several layers of one or more prisms is / are contained in a disc . generally , each disc includes at least one layer of at least part of a prism . each disc or plate ( 2 a ) can be fabricated through standard techniques such as mechanical tooling , ablation for example with a laser , hot embossing , uv embossing or molding using a master or other methods . it has been recognized that a master for molding may be fabricated through etching in e . g . silicon or through laser ablation . in the magnified cross - section view of fig2 c , a preferred example of a design for mechanical support ( 2 a , 2 b ) of the prisms is illustrated . the advantage with this design is that all prisms in a layer are in one piece and not in two or more pieces , which will need alignment later . the different discs or plates can in the assembly process be aligned relative to each other either in an assembly machine or through built - in structures , so called passive alignment , or they may be aligned manually . a great advantage with this manufacturing process is that many individual “ lenses ” or x - ray optics devices can be fabricated in parallel as indicated in fig2 d . as illustrated in fig2 d , a number of independent discs are produced on a common substrate . it is possible to produce two or more x - ray optics devices in parallel by stacking a number of such substrates in proper alignment and mechanically attaching them and finally extracting individual three - dimensional prism structures . fig2 d also illustrates the principle of constructing the prisms in several ( e . g . two ) pieces that will subsequently be assembled in order to provide a full prism or one or more layers of full prisms . another embodiment of the invention is based on preparing a thin foil with a layer of prisms as illustrated in fig3 a . the advantage with this method it that it is easy to manufacture a film or similar thin substrate with the desired structure since the height of the prisms above the film is relatively small . the prisms on the foil may for example be manufactured through hot embossing or uv embossing . for example , the prisms may be manufactured by embossing from a laser - abladed , etched or machined master , and then arranged on the foil . alternatively , the prisms may be formed directly into the foil by any of the above - mentioned methods ( e . g . laser ablation , etching , machining ). preferably , the foil is of the same type as now used for holography . there exist commercial foils for embossing that are used for hologram markings on e . g . credit cards . before rolling the foil it is preferably cut in a general diagonally curved form ( see fig3 f ), preferably into a stair - like structure ( see fig3 b and 3f ), in order to obtain the desired three - dimensional structure ( when rolled ). the foil is subsequently rolled , for example into a cylindrical or similar rotationally symmetric or near - symmetric structure according to fig3 c , in order to assume the desired shape of the device ( see fig3 d ). after the rolling is completed the foil is fixed with for example glue . the rolling can be performed manually under a microscope or in dedicated machines . as can be seen from the cross - section view of fig3 e , the cross - section number of prisms ( i . e . the number of prisms stacked orthogonal to the optical axis ) will differ at different positions along the optical axis . preferably , with the manufacturing procedure of fig3 a - f , the number of prisms in cross section of the device will change successively along the optical axis . fig4 is a schematic block diagram of an x - ray imaging system using an x - ray optics device . the x - ray imaging system basically comprises an x - ray source ( 4 a ), x - ray optics ( 4 b ) and a detector ( 4 c ) connectable to image processing circuitry ( 4 d ). the x - ray optics , and more particularly the optical axis of the three - dimensional prism structure , is preferably aligned with the general direction of incoming x - rays from the x - ray source . in particular the x - ray optics comprises a three dimensional structure of a multitude of prisms for both refraction and diffraction of incoming x - rays in order to focus radiation from the x - ray source . the detector is configured for registering radiation from the x - ray source that has been focused by said x - ray optics and has passed an object ( 4 e ) to be imaged . the detector is preferably connectable to image processing circuitry to obtain a useful image . the imaging system may for example be used for medical imaging , e . g . to obtain diagnostic images . in a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention , the prisms are arranged in at least one layer along an optical axis for incoming x - rays to achieve the desired focusing effect . advantageously , the three - dimensional prism structure is arranged such that x - rays further away from the optical axis will traverse more prisms than x - rays close to the optical axis . example embodiments of a prism structure that can be used have been discussed above . fig5 is a schematic flow diagram of a method for manufacturing an x - ray optics device . in step s 1 , a multitude of prisms is provided . in step s 2 the prisms are arranged in at least one layer along an optical axis for incoming x - rays to provide a three - dimensional prism structure for both refraction and diffraction of x - rays to shape the x - ray flux . the overall manufacturing procedure covers different methods including that described above in connection with fig2 a - d as well as that described in connection with fig3 a - f . for example , a number of discs , each having at least one layer of prisms , may be assembled side by side in alignment along the optical axis to form the three - dimensional prism structure . alternatively , it is possible to prepare a foil containing the prisms , and then rolling the foil into the three - dimensional prism structure . the embodiments described above are merely given as examples , and it should be understood that the claims are not limited thereto . further modifications , changes and improvements which retain the basic underlying principles disclosed are within the scope of the claims .",6
"referring first to fig1 the intruder alarm system comprises one or more electro - mechanical transducers , represented by the block 1 , which are arranged to provide electric signals in response to mechanical or acoustic vibrations incident upon said transducers . these transducers , sometimes known as geophones , may be attached to posts or walls or buried in the ground within the area to be protected by the alarm system , and may be connected either in common or individually to broadband amplifiers represented by the block 2 . in response to footsteps or other causes of ground - borne or acoustic vibrations within or near the protected area the transducers 1 receive vibrations and derive analogous electric signals , extending over a range of frequencies , the signals of interest for intruder detection ranging from say 15 to 150 hertz . the electric signals , after amplification , are applied to two narrow - band filters 3 and 4 having pass - bands some 12 and 37 hertz wide respectively centred on 33 hertz and 100 hertz respectively . the output signals from these filters are envelope detected , or halfwave rectified , at 5 and 6 respectively and the rectified signals applied to respective circuits 7 and 8 for detecting elements in these signals which indicate a human footstep , one of these circuits being shown diagrammatically in fig2 . the rectified signals in general comprise a succession of spikes representing a background of vibrations incident upon the transducers 1 , each spike made up of or extending over a few half - cycles of the selected frequency . rectified signals including components originating from an impact , such as a footstep , on the surface of the ground within range of the transducers 1 have superimposed on this background a pulse signal having a steep leading edge and a duration typically of the order of 30 to 100 milliseconds , and the system may be arranged so that two such pulse signals occurring within an interval of , say , 5 seconds gives rise to an alarm indication . referring now to fig2 which shows one of the circuits 7 and 8 , rectified signals are applied directly to a unity - gain stage 9 and , by way of voltage dividing resistors 10 and 11 , to an input of an envelope shaping circuit 12 . the stage 9 is followed by a d . c . restorer and compressor stage 13 . the envelope shaping circuit 12 comprises an amplifier 14 having a feedback path to its inverting input by way of a resistor 15 and a connection to that inverting input by way of a resistor 16 from a negative bias voltage source , such that the output signals of the amplifier 14 , at the cathode of a diode 17 in its output path , are set at a d . c . level some 30 to 50 millivolts positive with respect to earth . the proportion , some two thirds , of the rectified signal voltage that is applied to the circuit 12 is superimposed on this d . c . level at the cathode of the diode 17 , and the composite signal is applied by way of a resistor 18 to charge a capacitor 19 . the time constant of the resistor 18 with the capacitor 19 is several times as long as the rise time of any significant component of the rectified signals , and the effect is to produce a voltage waveform across the capacitor 19 which tends to follow that at the cathode of the diode 17 but with slowed rise - times . when the instantaneous value of the composite waveform falls , the capacitor 19 discharges by way of a resistor 10 which has a value an order of magnitude greater than that of the resistor 18 , so that the fall times tend to be slowed more than the rise times . it will be appreciated therefore that when a pulse signal occurs the voltage waveform applied by the circuit 12 to the inverting input of a differential amplifier 21 , which amplifier acts as a comparator , will start from a higher base level but rise at a slower rate than the original signal , as represented by the output signal from the stage 13 . the instantaneous value of the waveform from the circuit 12 will therefore be higher than that of the original signal except when this original signal rises quickly for more than a predetermined time , the rate of rise being restricted of course by the narrow bandwidth . these exceptions are characteristic of the vibration patterns which are of interest in detecting intruders . if the comparator amplifier 21 detects one of these high - rising transients the resulting voltage changeover at its output applies a positive potential to an integrator circuit 22 by way of a diode 23 and resistor 24 whereby the output voltage of the integrator circuit 22 commences going negative . if the trnsient is the leading edge of a pulse of longer than a given duration , which would be characteristic of signals arising from a human footstep , the output voltage of the integrator 22 passes the voltage set by divider resistors 25 and 26 in an input circuit of a second comparator 27 , and this comparator 27 thereupon changes its output state to register the event . when the pulse ends the integrator 22 is returned to its initial condition by current flow through a resistor 28 and a diode 29 into the output of the amplifier 21 . referring again to fig1 it has been found that human footsteps within a given range of the transducers 1 tend to give rise to these longer pulses within both the 30 hertz band and the 100 hertz band , whereas other sources of vibration do not . apart from slight dispersion effects which cause the 100 hertz components to arrive at the transducer 1 before the 33 hertz components , a human footstep within limited range of the transducers therefore gives rise to coincident events , as detected by the respective comparators 27 , and a circuit 30 is provided to detect and count such coincidences . this circuit 30 is shown in more detail in fig3 . since just two events in 5 seconds may be sufficient to justify an alarm being given the circuit 30 comprises a monostable circuit 31 which resets itself after a 5 second delay . a first event is then arranged to set this monostable circuit 31 and a second event occurring before the monostable circuit has reset is detected by an &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; gate 32 , which is arranged to apply an alarm signal to an indicator 35 , which may for example comprise a warning lamp and an audible alarm . to overcome the dispersion effect a 100 hertz event is arranged to set a monostable circuit 33 , which resets itself after a period off 150 milliseconds . if a 33 hertz event occurs within this period a coincident event output is provided by an &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; gate 34 . it will be appreciated that the transducers 1 may be arranged either to detect footsteps within a general area or within a strip - like area defining the perimeter of a protected area , the two events in 5 seconds facility being particularly aimed at detecting intruders crossing a perimeter strip .",6
"fig1 a shows a disc - shaped information carrier 1 having a track 9 intended for recording , which track is arranged in a helical pattern of windings 3 . the windings may also be arranged concentrically instead of helically . the track 9 on the information carrier is indicated by a servo pattern such as , for example , a pregroove 4 which enables a read / write head to follow the track 9 during scanning . a servo pattern may also be formed , for example , by regularly spread sub - patterns which , in the servo tracking system , periodically cause tracking signals to occur . fig1 b shows a cross - section along a line b -- b of the information carrier 1 , in which a transparent substrate 5 is covered by a recording layer 6 and a protective layer 7 . the pregroove 4 may also be arranged as a land or other material property that differs from its environment . furthermore , the servo pattern may also be formed by alternately raised and depressed windings , forming so - called land and groove patterns , with a transition from land to groove or vice versa in each winding . the recording layer 6 can be written optically , magneto - optically or magnetically by an apparatus for reading and / or writing information such as the known cd recordable or hard disk for computer use . the fig1 c and 1d show two examples of a periodic modulation ( wobble ) of the pregroove . this wobble causes an additional signal to arise in a servo tracking detector . the wobble is , for example , frequency modulated and in the modulation position - information is coded , such as an address or a time code . a description of an inscribable cd system comprising position - information obtained in such manner can be found in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 901 , 300 ( phn 12398 ) and u . s . pat . no . 5 , 187 , 699 ( phq 88002 ) both assigned to philips . another example of position - information modulation are header symbols included in the servo pattern , which header symbols are indicative of an address and indicate the beginning of the area for recording an information block . fig2 shows a land / groove pattern in which a wobble 21 is introduced on one side in which , for example , from the inside out ( from the bottom up in fig2 ) a land / groove ( l / g ) transition is straight and a groove / land ( g / l ) transition shows a wobble . the same wobble signal is then developed in land and groove , but since it is also known whether a land or a groove is scanned , the winding can be determined unambiguously . on the information carrier according to the invention , windings 3 in the area intended for recording contain winding information which indicates , for example , the radial position of the winding such as , for example , a winding number and / or sector addresses . a winding number , for example , counts up from 0 from the innermost winding outward . the winding information may also denote a distance to the center of rotation . for decoding the winding information , it is advantageous for the modulation of the pregroove to have a pattern such that a constant frequency evolves during reading , irrespective of the radial position . with a simple filter it is possible to separate well a modulated signal having a constant frequency from noise signals . for this purpose , the period of the space modulation preferably increases proportionally with the distance to the center of rotation 10 . as a result , a constant angular velocity of the information carrier produces to a constant modulation frequency . alternatively , another pattern of the space modulation period and a linked pattern of the angular velocity may be selected . for verifying the exact winding after a jump , it is advantageous for the winding information to be repeated several times per winding in winding information frames . such winding information frames are to be decodable independently . this also provides a good protection against local damage . it is advantageous to number the winding information frames sequentially with segment numbers , so that always an indication is available of the angular position relative to the reference line 8 , where the winding numbers increase for a helical track , or where the transitions take place at a land / groove . fig3 a - 3c diagrammatically show the modulation of a servo pattern according to the invention . this modulation may be realized as pregroove wobble on the information carrier as described in fig1 . the modulation 30 , 31 is shown in two adjacent windings n and n + 1 ( or winding pairs in the case of l / g shown in fig2 ). the modulation has a wobble 32 with a relatively long period and has synchronization elements 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 with a relatively short period . the amplitude of the synchronization elements is also larger than the amplitude of the wobble 32 . this is advantageous in that the synchronization elements are easy to detect . the synchronization elements may also be modulated in a different manner , such as , for example , a phase jump in the wobble . the synchronization elements may be used for synchronizing the writing and / or reading , such as controlling the rotation or scanning velocity of the information carrier , inserting the information blocks in the track at a precisely determined position on the information carrier , or reading the position - information from the wobble of the servo pattern . the combination of the wobble and the synchronization elements permits information to be recorded in blocks in a simple manner , even if information has already been recorded in track where the new information is to join . fig3 a shows an embodiment of the invention in which the synchronization elements in adjacent tracks always have an alternating polarity . the synchronization elements 35 in the winding n continue to have the same , for example , positive polarity , whereas the synchronization elements 36 in the adjacent winding n + 1 always have a different , for example , negative polarity . obviously , this pattern is repeated , so that track n - 1 is again equal to track n + 1 . the synchronization elements 37 in the winding n in fig3 b have an ever alternating polarity , whereas the corresponding synchronization elements 38 in the adjacent winding n + 1 always have the different , opposite polarity . in the embodiment shown in fig3 a and 3b , the synchronization elements in adjacent windings are always aligned . fig3 c shows a fixed shift between adjacent windings over half the distance between synchronization elements in lieu of aligned synchronization elements . in that case , the detection of the winding jump can be derived from the instant at which a synchronization element is read . this is advantageous in that an error is established more rapidly for an equal number of synchronization elements ( as a result of the lack of or early appearance of a synchronization element ). if , for example , one third of the distance is considered a shift , it is also possible to detect an undesired jump over two windings . obviously , further patterns of shifts are possible , possibly combined with the use of various types of synchronization elements . alternatively , a different number of synchronization elements ( and thus a different distance between them ) may be used per winding . in lieu of the different polarities , it is also possible to use various types of synchronization elements which comprise , for example , two short and two long pulses in different sequences . with the above different synchronization elements , distances and shifts it is possible to form a recurrent pattern of distinguishable differences over the number of tracks , by which also an undesired displacement over various tracks and / or the direction of the displacement can be detected . while such an information carrier according to the invention is being written , it is easy to detect whether a read / write head is positioned over the correct track or over an adjacent track . since always the instant and the polarity of the next synchronization element is known , an undesired jump to an adjacent winding can be detected when an erroneous synchronization element is found . the writing operation can then be interrupted immediately so as to damage the least possible data in an adjacent winding by overwriting . a next synchronization element may be waited for , and the writing will not be interrupted until after a recurrent error . it is also possible to combine the detected information with information from the servo system in which system often track - loss information can also be derived . combining servo track - loss information with synchronization element detection information enhances the reliability of the detection of undesired displacements of the read / write head . the synchronization elements are desirably recorded in the servo pattern at regular intervals . this provides a relatively fast detection of an undesired displacement of the read / write head . preferably , the mutual distance of synchronization elements in adjacent tracks is smaller than the length of an information block , so that at most this distance can be overwritten erroneously . in a reading / writing system in which the information is protected by an error correction code , the maximum length of the track that can be written erroneously is desirably selected smaller than the maximum burst error to be corrected . the distance between the synchronization elements and the number of erroneous detections thereof necessary for interrupting the writing operation can be adjusted to this . it is observed that the pattern of synchronization elements per winding of a helical track may differ . at a certain angular position , there will thus be an exchange of patterns as denoted along the imaginary line 8 in fig1 a . fig4 shows a device for writing and reading information blocks on a disc - shaped information carrier which can be written magneto - optically or optically ( via phase change ). the device comprises drive means 45 for causing the information carrier to rotate and a read / write head 42 for scanning the track indicated on the information carrier by the servo pattern . the read / write head 42 is positioned on the track in radial direction by servo control unit 44 . the read / write head scans the track with known tracking and focusing methods and a modulation caused , for example , by the wobble in the pregroove is present in the servo signals . the servo signal is demodulated and the position - information coded therein is recovered in the servo control unit 44 and passed on to the system control 46 . the radial position of the read / write head may be checked via the recovered position - information . the information applied to the input of the coding unit 41 is divided into blocks , as required , and converted into a writing signal for the read / write head 42 . the coding unit 41 comprise , for example , an error coder and channel coder . during the reading operation , the signal from the read / write head 42 is reconverted into the information in the decoding unit 43 comprising , for example , a channel decoder and an error corrector . the device comprises synchronization a unit 47 for synchronizing the writing and reading operations . the timing of the writing is then customarily controlled in dependence on the recovered synchronization elements . the system control 46 controls the synchronization unit 47 and , in addition , the servo control 44 , the coding unit 41 , the decoding unit 43 and the drive means 45 and is arranged for executing the procedures to be described hereinafter . when an information carrier 1 has been inserted into the device and a writing instruction has been received , the system control 46 positions the read / write head 42 over the desired winding and the writing is started at the correct instant , for example , synchronized with a first synchronization element . the pattern of the synchronization elements in the track to be written is known , however . the system control is arranged according to the invention for detecting a second synchronization element of a certain type and / or a synchronization element at a certain moment , and subsequently , further synchronization elements . however , if a synchronization element or a wrong type of synchronization element is detected at another instant that means that the read / write head 42 has wandered off to an adjacent winding as a result of a shock or a defect , and the system control will interrupt the writing operation . an example of a pattern of aligned synchronization elements in adjacent windings is shown in fig3 b . the polarity of the successive synchronization elements in the track to be written then alternates . if the system control detects the same polarity twice in succession , that signifies that the read / write head has wandered off to an adjacent winding . fig3 c shows a pattern of shifted synchronization elements . if the system control 46 detects a synchronization element too early , or does not find a synchronization element at the expected instant , that means that the read / write head will have wandered off to an adjacent track . when , for example , 4 different types of synchronization elements are used in a pattern which recurs every 4 windings , the system control will detect the error even with an undesired displacement over a maximum of 3 windings , because it detects an unexpected type . in an embodiment of the system control the writing will not be stopped until the second or further unexpectedly detected synchronization elements has occurred . this is advantageous in that a single synchronization element erroneously detected as faulty does not immediately lead to an interruption of the writing process . a further embodiment of the system control also evaluates the servo signals and derives therefrom information about track loss in known manner . this information may be combined with the unexpectedly detected synchronization elements . a decision to interrupt may then be made both in the case of a track loss indication and an erroneous synchronization element . this is advantageous in that the reliability of the decision is enhanced , because the two indications are formed independently . fig5 shows a reading device according to the invention by which an information block can be similarly read . the reading device comprises drive means 45 for causing the information carrier 1 to rotate and a read head 52 for scanning the track on the information carrier . the read head 52 is positioned in radial direction on the track by servo control unit 44 . furthermore , the device comprises a system control 46 . during the reading operation , the signal from the read head 52 is converted into the information in the decoder unit 43 which comprises , for example , a channel decoder and an error corrector . in the embodiment according to the invention , the system control 46 detects the synchronization elements during the reading operation . in the event of a deviation , the reading may be interrupted . a control signal may be sent to the servo control unit 44 , as required , so that a jump is made back in the direction of the desired winding , provided that this direction can be derived from the detected synchronization element ( the pattern is different over more than 2 adjacent windings ) and / or from the variation of the servo signals . furthermore , the system control can , after an interruption , directly carry out a repetition and cause the desired track to be read out once again .",6
"in order that the present invention may more readily be understood , the following description is given , merely by way of example , reference being made to the accompanying drawings . the device for inflating / deflating the shoulder straps is referred to in its entirety as ( 1 ) and has applications for packs , satchels ( 2 ) and , generally speaking , any article that can be worn on the back by a user and which demands the use of shoulder straps that press onto the user &# 39 ; s shoulders . the shoulder straps are made in a known manner of fabric or any other material and are attached at one end ( 3 a ) to the rear wall ( 2 a ) or shell of the satchel by any known appropriate means and to a quick - release fastener at the other end ( 3 b ) allowing connection to a strap ( 4 ) joined to the lower part ( 2 b ) of the satchel . according to the invention , the inflation / deflation device ( 1 ) is incorporated in a one - piece part ( 5 ) herein referred to as a pad constituting the means of guiding and adjusting the length of the strap , said part itself being connected to the shoulder strap by making the means of inflation member ( 6 ) communicate with an inflatable cushion ( 7 ) incorporated in the shoulder strap . a device of this type is provided on each shoulder strap of the satchel . the inflation member is formed of a resilient material that can be deformed as illustrated in fig6 . the one - piece part ( 5 ) forming a shaped pad is made of any appropriate material and is devised to fulfil four functions , namely : connection to one of the ends ( 3 b ) of said shoulder strap ( 3 ), allowing the injection of inflating air , connection to the length - adjustment strap ( 4 ) in order to adjust the carrying position of the satchel for the user . the pad of the one - piece part ( 5 ) is shaped in any appropriate manner with a flat cross section and may have a well styled , attractive appearance . the pad of the one - piece part ( 5 ) is advantageously made in two parts with a base ( 5 a ) and a cover ( 5 b ), the latter being separately mounted and fixed by bonding or other means . the stretched - shape base has , in its central part ( 5 a 1 ), a cavity ( 5 a 2 ) making it possible to position the inflation means ( 6 ) which must be connected to cushion ( 7 ). the base has an opening ( 5 a 3 ) in its thickness located in the above - mentioned central part and accommodating a shaft ( 8 ) integrally made during the manufacture of the pad and making it possible to guide and deflect the adjustment strap ( 4 ) that is physically connected to the pack or satchel . said base ( 5 a ) also comprises , at one of its ends , a tunnel shape ( 5 a 4 ) making it possible to guide and attach the end ( 3 b ) of the shoulder strap by any appropriate means . this tunnel shape ( 5 a 4 ) is shaped to permit and provide room for the connecting tube ( 9 ) between the inflation means ( 6 ) and cushion ( 7 ) incorporated in the shoulder strap . said inflation member includes a bulb shape ( 6 a ) intended to be centred in the central part of the cavity of the pad , said bulb extending as a pipe ( 6 b ) capable of penetrating into said part forming a tunnel ( 5 a 4 ) on the one hand , and permitting , on the other hand , connection to the cushion by means of an appropriate connecting tube ( 9 ). the pipe part ( 6 b ) is capable of fitting into a recess that matches its shape made in the thickness of the pad , this recess being arranged advantageously in the median axial plane of the pad . said pipe ( 6 b ) is therefore maintained securely in position . communication between the pipe ( 6 b ) and bulb ( 6 a ) is via a reduced - diameter channel ( 6 c ) that delimits on the bottom of the pipe a seat shape of which the function will be specified below . vertically above the area where the pipe and reduced - diameter channel are connected , there is provision for an additional protruding bump ( 6 d ) capable of receiving , during certain phases , a ball ( 10 ) of small cross - sectional area . this ball is pushed into the pipe by a spiral spring ( 11 ) that is suitably guided into the latter , said ball blocking off the connecting channel ( 6 c ) between the bulb and the pipe when the inflation / deflation means is not in use . spring ( 11 ) is secured in said pipe by a retention lip ( 6 e ) formed on the outside of the pipe . cover ( 5 b ) which is separately mounted on the pad is devised with two circular openings ( 5 b 1 - 5 b 2 ) of appropriate size to surround and protect , on the one hand , the bulb part 6 a of the inflation means and , on the other hand , the bump part 6 d of the air pipe , leaving the protruding projecting parts of the bulb and of the bump visible . cushion ( 7 ) which is linked to inflation means ( 6 ) is long and is inserted inside the actual shoulder strap . in a known manner , this cushion may comprise various chambers that communicate with each other making it possible to split up the inflation zone into segments . the connecting tube between the cushion and the inflation device is made in any appropriate manner . the operation of the device will now be described . each shoulder strap of the satchel or pack is devised with such a device . the end of the shoulder strap is attached , as stated previously , on the pad by any appropriate known means and the cushion is made to communicate with the inflation device via the intermediate tube . the lower strap attached to the pack or satchel has been inserted into the lower part of the pad into the opening so that the entire assembly is securely held . when not in use , the shoulder straps are not inflated . when the user has correctly put the satchel or pack onto their back , the shoulder straps are located over the individual &# 39 ; s chest . using the right or left hand , the user simply needs to press the bulb as shown in fig6 in order to ensure inflation . the pressure exerted on the bulb makes it possible to expel the air and push the ball in opposition to the spring in the connecting pipe , the air then being forced into the cushion located inside the shoulder strap . the user repeats this operation several times in order to obtain the desired inflation pressure . after inflation , the inflation bulb is no longer used and the ball , under the effect of the spring &# 39 ; s decompression force , returns to its original position , thus blocking off the seating of the bottom of the pipe . to ensure the deflation function shown in fig7 the user simply has to press on the bump 6 d of the pipe , this pressure causes displacement of the ball in the pipe and frees the reduced - diameter channel between the bulb and the pipe . the air can escape into the bulb and into the outside atmosphere through an opening in the bulb . the cushion is gradually deflated until all the air is evacuated . the device according to the invention is very simple to produce and operate . according to the invention , the inflation / deflation device is entirely integrated into the support pad which also provides connection to the lower strap . the entire device is produced so that its various components cannot be tampered with because only the bulb and the deflation means can be accessed . the pad may also be of any appropriate shape and profile . the area where the lower strap is connected and deflected may be arranged differently , for instance , at the end of the pad opposite the area where the shoulder strap is attached . as well as its functional aspect , the inflation device therefore helps give the pad its special attractive appearance . the user can , depending on the load , adjust , in each shoulder strap , the inflation pressure , thus obtaining optimum comfort at their discretion . the integral cushion in the shoulder strap is of any appropriate shape and design .",8
"it should be understood initially that the device is intended basically to forceably draw air from both the ceiling and floor areas of a room for a comingling or mixing thereof and a subsequent discharge into the liveable area of the room hereinafter referred to as the occupant zone . the term homogenize is used to designate the mixing and comingling of the warmer and colder air respectively received from the ceiling and floor areas . the occupant zone designates that area of a room or enclosure , regardless of the height thereof , which a person or persons will normally occupy . this area or zone will normally extend from the floor to approximately 6 1 / 2 feet . further , as the occupants of a room for any length of time will normally either be seated or lying down , as in a bedroom , the discharge of the homogenized air should preferably occur at approximately arm chair height for maximum comfort . referring now more specifically to the drawings , the basic air homogenizer 10 is illustrated as a free standing embodiment in fig1 and 2 . it will be noted that this homogenizer 10 consists essentially of a vertically elongated tube or duct 12 having a floor supported lower end stabilized by radially projecting feet 14 so as to provide for a self - supporting unit . the air intake or inlet for the cooler &# 34 ; floor &# 34 ; air consist of several screen protected openings 16 through the lower portion of the duct 12 . if so desired , appropriate fixed direction or adjustable louvers can also be provided in conjunction with the openings 16 . the size of the opening or openings 16 is to be such so as to enable an adequate intake of air without inducing disruptive air flows , excessive noise , or the like . the open upper end 20 of the duct 16 , which also might be designated a housing , terminates adjacent the ceiling 18 of the room with this upper end constituting the intake or inlet for the warmer &# 34 ; ceiling &# 34 ; air . as such , it will of course be appreciated that the open upper end or inlet will of necessity be spaced sufficiently distance from the actual ceiling so as to enable an adequate forced introduction or drawing of air therein . this open end of the duct 12 can also be louvered or screened as desired . an air outlet opening 22 is provided at a point intermediate along the length of the duct or housing 12 . this outlet 22 can extend either partially or completely about the duct 12 with the upper and lower duct sections suitably structurally inter - connected . as with the inlet openings , the outlet opening 22 can be provided with a suitable screen or louvered grill , either fixed or adjustable . further , the outlet is to be so positioned as to effect a discharge of air into the occupant zone . in the homogenizer 10 as illustrated in fig1 the outlet 22 is at or slightly below approximately mid height . such an arrangement would be particularly adapted for a room , such as a store or the like , wherein the occupants would normally be standing . should it be desired to use the homogenizer 10 in a home , the outlet 22 will normally be located so as to effect a lower discharge of the homogenized air . the actual air flow , as indicated by the arrows in fig2 is a forced air flow effected by a motor driven fan unit 24 located internally within the duct 12 and axially aligned with the duct , in radial alignment with the outlet 22 , so as to induce an axial flow of the &# 34 ; floor &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; ceiling &# 34 ; air inwardly through the floor and ceiling inlets 16 and 20 for a comingling , mixing or homogenizing of the two air streams at the outlet 22 immediately prior to , during and immediately subsequent to the lateral outward movement of the air through the outlet 22 . the fan can be in the nature of a vertically elongated squirrel cage type blower with a solid central web 26 , and can be mounted in any appropriate manner through suitable cross bracing . the drive motor 28 , preferably an electric motor , either can effect a direct drive of the fan shaft or a pulley driving thereof as suggested in fig2 . in this instance , the motor 28 is bolted to the exterior of the duct 12 within a small removable housing 30 . fig3 illustrates a further embodiment of the homogenizer , designated by reference numeral 32 , wherein a major portion of the height of the air passage forming duct is in the nature of a collapsible flexible sleeve 34 of appropriate air impervious material . the lower end of the sleeve will closely engage about an upstanding annular flange 36 affixed to the base unit 38 . the upper end of the sleeve 34 , when extended , will be suspended by a wire bail 40 selectively engaged with a ceiling mounted hook 42 so as to maintain the sleeve 34 upright . the bail 40 will appropriately engage with a wire ring 44 to which the fabric of the sleeve 34 is secured and which defines the desired open upper inlet end 46 positionable adjacent the ceiling 48 in operative position . the base 38 includes a hollow truncated conical housing 50 supported on rubber gripping feet 52 and provided with a series of peripheral openings 54 which define the lower or &# 34 ; floor &# 34 ; air inlet . a motor driven fan unit 56 mounts on the upper portion of the base , through any appropriate mounting bars , straps , or the like , and effects a vertical axial inward drawing of both &# 34 ; ceiling &# 34 ; air and &# 34 ; floor &# 34 ; air for a lateral discharge thereof through an appropriate discharge grill 58 , louvered if so desired . arrows have also been used to generally designate the air flow . inasmuch as the base 38 in this embodiment may be relatively low so as to provide for a compact easily moved unit upon a collapsing of the sleeve 34 , a directing of the discharging homogenized air to the desired height within the occupant zone can be facilitated by the provision of an upwardly inclined flange deflector 60 peripherally about the base housing 50 immediately outward of the discharge grill 58 . in the embodiment of fig4 the air homogenizer is incorporated within a partition wall 62 with the vertical air passage or duct 64 defined between a pair of adjacent studs 66 and enclosed by opposed facing panels 68 . first air inlets 70 are provided through the opposed facing panels adjacent the ceiling while second air inlets 72 are provided through the facing panels 68 adjacent the floor . a fan housing or enclosure 74 is mounted at an intermediate position along the vertical air passage 64 so as to correspond with the desired height within the occupant zone for the discharging air which , upon being mixed or homogenized , discharges through the laterally directed louvered or grilled outlets 76 . the movement of the air through the upper and lower inlets for discharge through the intermediate outlets will be effected by upper and lower bladed fans or blower wheels 78 engaged with oppositely projecting drive shafts of a centrally mounted motor 80 . the motor 80 is secured in any appropriate manner between the studs 66 for example by mounting straps 82 . it is to be appreciated that the mounting of the components , and in particular the grills or louvers , will be arranged so as to allow access to the interior of the fan compartment or housing should such be required . further , the exact nature of the air directing discharge louvers can be varied in accordance with the demands of a particular situation . for example , the louvers can be adjustable or oriented so as to provide for increased turbulence to further encourage the homogenizing or comingling of the two air streams . in addition , while the air homogenizer of fig4 illustrates both an intake and discharge to two sides of the partition , thus accommodating two adjacent rooms , the intake and discharge can be to a single side for single room use . fig6 is a variation of the partition air homogenizer of fig4 illustrating the use of a single fan or blower wheel 84 mounted on the single drive shaft 86 of a centrally located electric motor 88 also provided so as to effect a discharge of the air , through a screened or louvered outlet 90 , into the occupant zone between the upper and lower inlets . as will be appreciated , the fan or blower 84 is of a size so as to effectively axially draw the inlet air thereto and radially discharge this air . further , the housing , as in the case with the arrangement in fig4 should be such so as to allow access to the interior thereof for servicing , installation , and the like . fig7 illustrates a wall mounted form of air homogenizer 92 wherein the vertical air passage forming duct 94 includes a relatively long horizontal intermediate portion 96 which mounts the housing 98 enclosing the motor driven blower and homogenized air outlet or discharge 100 . utilizing the horizontal intermediate section 96 within the vertical air duct 94 allows a substantial lateral positioning of the &# 34 ; ceiling &# 34 ; air inlet 102 and the &# 34 ; floor &# 34 ; air inlet 104 respectively positioned closely adjacent the ceiling and floor of the room . this lateral positioning of the inlets allows for a better accommodation of large areas for an equalization of the temperature within the occupant zone , and as such , this embodiment would most likely find its more practical usage within large commercial or industrial buildings . the actual mounting of the assembly on the wall can be effected in any appropriate manner , such as through mounting brackets 106 or the like . fig8 schematically illustrates the homogenizer in combination with a room or home air - conditioning system including a heater or furnace 108 and a cooling unit 110 . as in the previously described systems , appropriate blower means 112 acts so as to inwardly draw the air from the ceiling inlet 114 and floor inlet 116 for discharge into the occupant zone through outlet 118 . in the system of fig8 that portion of the air passage or duct 120 above the blower 112 can be , through appropriate bypass ducting , directed through the heating unit or furnace 108 which will be activated during those periods when additional heat is needed so as to bring the temperature of the homogenized air to a comfortable level as sensed by any appropriate thermostat means 122 or the like . the cooling unit 110 is located within that portion of the air passage or duct between the floor inlet 116 and the blower unit 112 for selective use when additional cooling is required . in those circumstances wherein additional cooling is required within the occupant zone , and inasmuch as the occupant zone extends upwardly from the floor , a damper 124 can be provided in the air passage immediately above the blower unit 112 for a closing thereof . at such times , it will of course be appreciated that the heating unit or furnace is off . by the same token , the cooling unit will not be operative during those periods wherein it is necessary to raise the temperature within the occupant zone so as to achieve a comfortable level . from the foregoing , it will be appreciated that a distinctive system has been devised for heat energy conservation . basically , provision is made for comingling , mixing or homogenizing the warm air from adjacent the ceiling with the cool or cold air adjacent the floor and discharging the homogenized air directly within the occupant zone of the room . in this manner , a high degree of stability and lack of air stratification is achieved . also , the rapid vertical movement of air , as occurs in those systems wherein the cold air from the floor is moved directly to the ceiling and or the warm air from the ceiling is moved directly to the floor , is eliminated . the actual system can be incorporated within a free standing assembly , internally within a partition wall , externally on a wall , or as a part of a central air - conditioning system . as will be appreciated , the foregoing is considered illustrative of the principals of the invention and since modifications and changes may occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described . accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , following within the scope of the invention as claimed .",5
"according to an embodiment of an aspect of the present invention , there is illustrated a foldable , adjustable wheeled walker device comprising a lightweight tubular frame having two rear legs wherein each leg is terminated with single wheels ; and two front legs wherein each leg is terminated with pivoting dual wheels ; two adjustable handle assemblies extending from the rear legs ; and at least one removable stability member adapted to engage the light weight tubular frame . one separate , curved cross - brace on each side of the walker provides a structural link between the front and rear legs of the frame when in use . folding of the frame is achieved by disconnecting one end of each cross - brace , then allowing the rear and front legs to freely fold into each other about the pivot . two adjustable handle assemblies include a width , vertical and depth adjustment means . the adjustable handle assemblies are provided to extend upwardly and parallel to the rear legs , then bend downwardly to provide a length of tubing that is generally horizontal . adjustable hand grips allow the handle location to be adjusted to meet the needs of the user . an adjustable , flexible rear support or strap connects the handles to provide a contact surface at or above the hips of the user . this support or strap is important to limit the child &# 39 ; s rearward placement within the walker and cue the child to maintain an upward posture while ambulating . according to another aspect of the present invention , the removable adjustable stability member is a removable , weighted stability cuff which may be provided on each side of the front support tube near the pivoting front wheels . according to an embodiment of this aspect , the cuff can be fabric with a pair of straps that holds the cuff securely and circumferentially using hook and loop fasteners , for example . the weighted stability cuff contains three individual , elasticized pockets for up to three counterweights , for example . each cuff supplied with three weights provides the maximum weight and rearward stability for the child user . the weights may be removed from the cuffs in pairs to reduce the stability and enhance the maneuverability of the walker to match the abilities of the child . according to yet another aspect of the present invention , a soft fabric backpack may be removably attached between rear legs of the walker . the backpack preferably has various compartments for storage of school supplies , toys , and snacks . it should be understood that the weight of the frame , wheels , attachment hardware and backpack of the walker according to an embodiment of the present invention are preferably selected to provide the lowest strength to weight ratio possible using conventional materials to minimize cost . since the weights of the structural components are relatively low , the stability cuff weights needed to achieve the desired stability and handling of the walker are also relatively low . the overall weight of the walker with the full weighted cuff remains manageable by caregivers who must fold and lift the walker for storage . referring now to the drawings , fig1 a and fig1 b shows the invention in its position for use as a walker . the device has a front ( main ) support tube 1 that is pivotably connected to a rear ( cross ) assembly 2 through a main bracket 6 . the front support tube 1 is fixed in its in - use position to the rear leg assembly by a radial cross brace 3 located on both sides of the walker . the brace 3 is mechanically fastened to the front support tube by a fastener 20 on one end , and a threaded hand knob 17 at the other end . the threaded end of the hand knob 17 runs through a hole in the end of the cross brace 3 . the knob is captivated on one side of the cross brace by the knob and on the other side by a retaining ring . the end of the front support tube 1 is terminated on both ends by a pivotable dual front wheel assembly 11 by means of a specially design adapter 14 ( shown in fig1 ). the adapter 14 is a bar that locates within and is mechanically attached to the tubular ends of the front support tube 1 and the tubular housings of the dual front wheel assemblies 11 . similarly , the lower end of the cross tube assembly 2 is terminated by a single , non - pivotable rear wheel assembly 12 . the terminal end of each of two handle assemblies 4 locates slidably within a handle extension receiver 5 that is connected to the rear tube assembly 2 by two dual tube split clamps 9 on each side . the height of the handle assembly 4 is incrementally adjustable upwardly or downwardly via a removable double ball lock pin 21 . in its in - use position , the pin 21 connects the handle assembly 4 to the handle extension receiver 5 through matched holes in these components the pin 21 is inserted into a single through hole in the extension receiver 5 and one of a series of through holes in the handle assembly 4 . it is the matching hole selected in the handle assembly 4 that affixes the handle height . a handle extension stopper 8 prevents the handle assembly 4 from sliding down into handle extension 5 when the ball lock pin 21 is removed . the pin 21 is removed either to adjust the height of the handle assembly 4 relative to the handle extension receiver 5 , or , if necessary , to remove the handle assembly 4 from the receiver 5 before folding the walker for storage . a flexible rear back strap 7 is removably affixed to the inside of and adjusts in height with the handle assemblies 4 . further , the rear back strap 7 may be removed and reattached horizontally relative to the position of handle assemblies 4 . as an example , a walker according to this embodiment , in this case particularly directed to a child user , may have the following approximate dimensions : a = 16 to 25 ″; b = 25 to 27 ″; c = 13 to 15 ″; and d = 21 to 23 ″. fig2 shows the configuration of the main support tube 1 . the tube is bent in a u - shape configuration to outline the perimeter of the walker . small diameter , thin - walled aluminum tubing , for example , with threaded rivet - style nuts are affixed to minimize the contribution of this member to the weight of the walker and reduce the likelihood of hand injuries caused by protruding fasteners . for example , ¾ ″ od × 0 . 065 wall 6061 - t6 aluminum tubing can be used . fig3 illustrates the rear assembly 2 comprising tube weldment that incorporates the cross support tube 23 and cross tube uprights 25 . aluminum upright end fittings 27 are each pinned with a coil spring pin 29 to terminate the ends of upright tubes 25 . the end fittings each accept a rear wheel assembly 12 axle at the lower end , and a pivot axis fastener ( 19 in fig1 b ) at the upper end . the cross brace 3 , shown in fig4 , is a structurally strong member that connects and bears the separation loading of the front support tube 1 and the cross tube assembly 2 . the brace 3 is configured to run tangentially to both connecting members when the walker is in its in - use position to avoid contact with the child &# 39 ; s legs and feet during use . as an example , the cross brace 3 can be fabricated with stainless steel 302 . fig5 shows the right hand version of the handle assembly 4 . a handle extension 31 is the member that connects to the handle extension receiver 5 described previously . the handle extension 31 is bent in two planes — one bend to position the tube inwardly to place the hand grip 33 in close proximity to the child , and another bend to position the handle extension 31 in an orientation that is generally parallel to the ground . the handle 35 is telescopically and removably connected to the horizontal end of the handle extension tube 31 by a pair of fasteners 36 and threaded back strap retainers 37 . incremental displacement of the handle 35 is achieved by removing the fasteners 36 , sliding the handle 35 axially along the tubular end of the handle extension tube 31 and relocating the fasteners 36 through the mating holes . the two back strap retainers 37 have a flanged end to retain one end of the rear back strap 7 through its adjustment holes . the other end of the rear back strap 7 is connected to a pair of retainers on the inside surface of the other handle . a soft , rubberized handgrip 33 is located axially over the handle 35 to provide a comfortable support surface for the child &# 39 ; s hand . a plastic ball 39 terminates the handle 35 to cue the child as to the location of his / her hand on the handgrip 33 . the tubular configuration of the handle extension receiver 5 is shown in fig6 . at the upper end of the tube has a sawcut end with a stress relief hole at its root . the upper dual split clamp 9 locates over this end such that as the clamp is tightened , the extension receiver 5 elastically deflects to eliminate the clearance between the handle assembly 4 and the extension receiver 5 . this feature improves the responsiveness of the walker to movement at the handle by eliminating the play between the handle assembly 4 and the handle extension receiver 5 . for example , the handle extension receiver 5 can be fabricated from ⅞ ″ od × 0 . 049 wall 6061 - t6 aluminum tubing . the left hand version of the main bracket 6 is displayed in fig7 . the main bracket 6 is made from an acetyl plastic , for example , to provide strength and lightness for the assembly . the cross bore in the bracket is sized to locate snuggly over the front support tube 1 . this is achieved by providing an undersized lead in that allows the bracket 6 to snap securely onto the front support tube 1 . since the plastic has excellent bearing characteristics , no additional bushings are provided to support the main pivot fastener 19 . fig8 shows the rear back strap 7 with adjustment holes 41 for connection to the back strap retainers 37 of the handle assemblies 4 . the rear back strap 7 can be an extendable thermoplastic rubber that provides strength and a firm contact surface at the level of the child user &# 39 ; s hips . for example , the rear back strap 7 can be santoprene ™ extrusion . incremental horizontal translation of the rear back strap 7 is achieved by pulling the strap ends away from the handle 35 such that the two back strap retainers 37 are pulled through an adjacent pair of adjustment holes 41 . another pair of adjacent adjustment holes 41 is relocated over the back strap retainers 37 and stretched elastically over the flange of the back strap retainers to secure the strap to the handle 35 . fig9 displays the dual split clamp 9 that connects the handle extension receiver 5 to the cross support tube assembly 2 . a through hole in one half of the clamp and a threaded hole in the other half allows a fastener to apply gripping forces simultaneously to the handle extension tube 5 and cross support tube assembly 2 . the rear wheel assembly 12 is shown in fig1 . this configuration is for the right hand rear wheel . the left hand version is the mirror image of this arrangement . the rear wheel 43 is rotationally affixed through a shoulder screw axle 45 to the upright end fitting 47 at the end of the cross support tube assembly 2 . it is preferable that the rear wheels of the walker be equipped with an anti - rollback means , i . e . only forward movement is allowed . for example , an anti - rollback finger 49 can be pivotably connected to the cross support tube assembly 2 and rests freely on the studded hub of the wheel 43 . as the wheel 43 rotates rearward ( i . e ., moves clockwise in the side view ), the finger 49 rotates downward ( counterclockwise ) between two studs . since the anti - rollback finger 49 reaches its limit of rotation , the wheel 43 locks and cannot continue to move in a clockwise motion . as the walker moves forward , the wheel 43 rotates in a counterclockwise orientation and the finger 49 rotates about the pivot in a clockwise motion . the anti - rollback finger rests on the crest of the studs as the wheel turns , thereby providing unhindered motion of the wheel 43 . fig1 displays the front and side views of the wheel adapter 14 . fig1 illustrates the stability cuff in its in - use position as secured to the front support tube 1 . fig1 shows the open view of the outside surface of the removable , fabric stability cuff . the outer skin is preferably non - expandable to retain the shape of the cuff when wrapped around the end front support tube 1 . two nylon retention straps with hook and loop ends and d - style rings provide a removable , but secure attachment to the front support tube 1 . fig1 displays the inner surface of the stability cuff and the pocket that retains the counterweight . according to this particular embodiment , three pockets are provided — one for each weight . the pocket envelops and retains the weight within the stretchy inner skin . the pockets each have a slot at one end to allow the weight to be readily inserted into or removed from the stability cuff . fig1 shows the three weights that are used within the cuff to provide stability adjustment to the walker . adding weights to the cuff increases the rearward and lateral stability of the walker . removing weights from the stability cuff reduces the rearward and lateral stability , and thereby increases the maneuverability of the walker . preferably , two weighted stability cuffs are located at the terminating ends of the front support tube 1 . as an example , each weighted cuff can be 1 . 5 pounds , providing a total addition of 3 pounds to the front end . if the walker itself is 6 . 5 pounds , for example , which is achievable if high strength , low weight structural components are implemented as described above , the addition of 3 pounds to the front end would yield a significant difference in the stability of the walker . other configurations are possible . for example , one or more stability cuffs could be provided at the terminating ends of the cross support tube assembly 2 to increase the forward stability of the walker , additional pockets could be provided to increase the ballasting of the walker , and the cuff could be slidably attached to the front support tube 1 and moved up the length of the tube to fine tune the stability of the walker . other locations of the counterweights could be used in alternative embodiments . for example , removable weights could be placed in the backpack to increase the rearward stability of the walker . in sum , the removable weighted stability cuffs enable quick and easy modification of the stability characteristics of the walker . fig1 illustrates the backpack in its in use position on the walker . the backpack can be removably attached between the horizontal member of the front support tube 1 and the cross tube of the cross support tube assembly 2 . the upper strap wraps around the upper front support tube and connects to a mating hook and loop fastener strip sewn on the backpack . a lower strap wraps around the rear support tube to provide lower securement for the bag . according to one configuration , the flap of the backpack faces toward the child user to provide easy access to the internal contents . compartments within the bag and bilateral mesh drink holders provide storage for school supplies , school notes , toys , snacks , and drinking boxes . the center of mass of the backpack is located inside the axles of the rear wheels to prevent a loss of rearward stability as the weight of bag contents increases . the embodiment of the present invention described above addresses many of the shortcomings of existing products . in particular , the walker device of the present invention may comprise one or more of up to seven features typically not found on commercial walkers , including : ( a ) a light tubular frame configured to ease transfers and improve access to tables in areas frequented by preschoolers and primary school -

"in the arrangement shown in fig1 two identical sorting apparatuses s1 and s2 , according to the invention , are placed on a printer d , wherein the sorting apparatus s2 sits on the sorting apparatus s1 . each of the sorting apparatuses comprises eight sorter pockets designated by a in fig2 . the printer d feeds printed sheets vertically in an upward direction through an outlet gap and consequently in the direction of the sorting apparatuses s1 and s2 arranged above the printer . as shown in fig2 the sorting apparatus s1 , which is placed directly on the printer d , comprises a housing 1 whose base 2 includes an opening or slot 3 forming a take - up site for sheets . guiding elements 4 , which project into the housing 1 from base 2 , adjoin the feed opening 3 and form a vertical sheet feed path 5 . the vertical central plane of the sheet feed path 5 contains a swiveling axis 6 which is arranged above the path 5 and is shown as a point in fig2 . axis 6 extends parallel to the base 2 and passes through a feed channel gap or nip , designated generally by 7 , which is swivelable around the axis 6 . as can also be seen in fig3 the feed channel comprises a pair of circulating members in the form of rollers 9 and 10 , which are arranged at a feed side or inlet end 8 of the channel . another pair of circulating members , which are formed by means of rollers 12 and 13 , are arranged on an outlet side 11 of the channel 7 . a pair of guiding elements 14 extend between the roller pairs 9 , 10 and 12 , 13 to guide sheets along channel 7 . the rollers have axle ends or journals 9a , 10a , 12a , engage with two shield plates 15 and 16 , which are located opposite one another , and form a unit with the rollers . the shield plates 5 and 16 are rigidly connected with one another by means of spacing elements , e . g . rods , not shown , and comprise an outwardly projecting axle end 17 in each instance . bearing eyes 0 , which receive the axle end 17 in such a way as to define the position of the swiveling axis 6 , are provided in two outer wall parts 18 and 19 which lie opposite one another . consequently , the unit comprising the feed channel 7 is swivelable around the axis 6 . as a part of the feed channel , the rollers 9 , 10 form a feed gap . while the rollers 9 , 10 and 12 are supported by means of their axle ends 9a , 10a and 12a directly in the shield plates 5 and 16 so as to be rotatable , the roller 13 is movable so as to swivel around the roller 12 and engages with a steering arrangement . in the embodiment shown , the axle ends 13a of the roller 13 penetrate a circular arc - shaped guide slot 21 in the two shield plates 15 and 16 in the sense of this steering arrangement and extend on both sides in a sliding block 22 , in each instance , in which they are supported so as to be rotatable . while the circular arc of the guide slots 21 have their center in the axis of the roller 12 , the sliding blocks 22 are displaceable in grooves 23 forming a connecting link . the grooves 23 , which are constructed identically in the side wall parts 18 and 19 , extend in a curved manner and enclose the guiding axis 6 by approximately 180 °. with reference to a circular arc - shaped path 24 ( fig2 ), which is traveled by the roller 12 during the swiveling of the feed channel 7 or of the shield plates 15 , 16 around the axis 6 , the grooves 23 comprise portions with a smaller and a larger radius of curvature . this will be discussed in more detail in the following . the shield plate 15 comprises the swiveling axis 6 adjacent a circular arc - shaped rack portion 15a which carries teeth 15b . a stepping motor 25 , which is fastened at the side wall part 18 , carries a pinion 27 on its shaft 26 , which pinion 27 meshes with the teeth 15b . an electric motor 28 , which drives the roller 12 via a pinion 29 and a toothed wheel 30 , which is connected with one of the axle ends 12a so as to be rigid against rotation , is fastened at the shield plate 15 . a pulley 31 , which is placed on the other of the two axle ends 12a so as to be rigid against rotation , is connected to a pulley 33 via a drive belt 32 . the pulley 33 is arranged on one of the axle ends 9a so as to be rigid against rotation . consequently , the electric motor 28 is in a drive connection with the roller 12 as well as with the roller 9 and drives both with the same circumferential speed . at 33 a control is indicated in a schematic manner . input 34 of control 33 is connected to the printer d or directly to a computer ( not shown ). the control 33 is connected to the stepping motor 25 and to the electric motor 28 via lines 35 and 36 . the control 33 is connected to a transmitter 48 and receiver 49 of a photocell via lines 46 and 47 , the photocell being arranged in the vicinity of the base 2 in the sheet feed path 5 . if , as shown , another sorting apparatus s2 is placed on the sorting apparatus s1 the control 33 is also in electrical connection with this sorting apparatus and governs it also ( not shown ). as can be seen in fig2 the sorter pockets a are formed by means of plates 37 which are fastened in the housing 1 in a manner which is not shown , and extend through an opening 38 . each plate 37 comprises a projection 37b at its inner end 37a , which projection 37b is semicircular in cross - section , wherein the projections of adjacent plates 37 leave open an intermediate space 39 between them . the ends 37a of the plates 37 are adjacent the grooves 23 . each of the plates 37 forms an output site with its projection 37b . another output site is formed by means of a slot 40 in the upper wall 41 of the housing 1 . adjacent the take - up site formed by the feed opening 3 , the sorting apparatus s1 comprises another take - up site which is formed by means of a feed gap 42 in a side wall 43 of the housing 1 , which feed gap 42 is arranged at the height of the swiveling axis 6 . in the shown arrangement of the sorting apparatus above the office machine , i . e . the printer d , the feed gap 42 remains unused . in the operation of the sorting apparatus s1 , the feed of the sheets printed by means of the printer d is effected by means of the feed opening 3 , wherein the sheet guide path 5 ensures its alignment with the axis 6 . when a sheet to be sorted arrives in the sheet guide path 5 , the feed channel 7 is in the position shown in fig2 . the photocell 48 , 49 reports the arrival of a sheet in the sheet guide path 5 as a corresponding signal to the control 33 which sets the electric motor 28 in operation for the drive of the rollers 9 , 10 and 12 , 13 . after a predetermined time interval required by the sheet in order to cover the path between the photocell 48 , 49 and the feed opening , the control operates the sorting process . the sheet which is still fed by means of the printer d can consequently run into the feed channel 7 or between the feed opening and the rollers 9 , 10 . while the rollers 9 , 10 feed the sheet from the printer through the feed channel 7 at the same speed , the channel is swiveled by means of the stepping motor 25 . the swiveling is effected corresponding to a sorting signal of the printer which is processed by the control 33 , in that this supplies a quantity of pulses to the stepping motor corresponding to a predetermined output site . assuming the control 33 has assigned the output site corresponding to the sorter pocket a5 to the sorting signal obtained by the printer for the output sheet , the feed channel 7 is swiveled into the swiveling position which is indicated by means of the dash - dot arrow line 44 . the assigned position of the rollers 12 , 13 is drawn in a dashed line . as explained , the circumferential position of the roller 13 relative to the roller 12 is determined by means of the configuration or the respective position of the groove 23 relative to the path 24 with reference to a determined swiveling position of the feed channel 7 . in the case of the swiveling position indicated by means of the arrow line 44 , the curvature radius of the groove 23 is approximately equal to the radius of the path 24 , and the axis 13b of the roller 13 practically extends through the path 24 . the rollers 12 and 13 can accordingly transfer the sheet without deflection into the sorter pocket a5 in the direction of the arrow line 44 . the angular velocity at which the stepping motor 25 swivels the feed channel 7 around the axis 6 , is selected in such a way that it has also traveled the largest required swiveling angle , i . e . the angle for reaching the sorter pocket a1 , when the start of the sheet has reached the end of the feed channel . as explained , it is assumed that the feed velocity in the feed channel is normally equal to that of the office machine , i . e . that of the printer in the present case . when the end of the sheet passes the photocell 48 , 49 , the latter produces another signal . the control 33 switches the electric motor 28 to a higher speed on the basis of this signal , by means of which the sheet is conveyed out of the feed channel at a higher feed velocity and is fed into the selected sorter pocket a5 . the sheet arrives completely in the sorter pocket a5 with its residual movement energy and is deposited with its rear end behind the projection 37b . in a predetermined time interval since the last signal of the photocell 48 , 49 -- sufficient to allow the sheet to exit completely from the feed channel 7 -- the control 33 causes the electric motor 28 to be stopped on the one hand and the stepping motor 25 to be controlled on the other hand in order to move the feed channel back in the direction of the initial position shown in fig2 . the described process is repeated as soon as the photocell 48 , 49 reports the arrival of another sheet . if a sheet is brought into the sorter pocket a1 , for example , the feed channel is swiveled into the direction indicated by means of the arrow line 45a . in so doing , the roller 13 also swivels relative to the roller 12 in such a way that the sheet undergoes a deflection corresponding to the arrow direction 45b when exiting from the feed channel 7 . the direction of the deflection is selected in such a way that the sheet encloses the smallest possible angle a relative to the sorter pocket , i . e . its plate 37 , and nevertheless reaches an intermediate space 39 . an opposite swiveling of the roller 13 relative to the roller 12 is effected in an analogous way in order to deposit a sheet in the sorter pocket a8 . a deflection of the sheet is also possible in a direction which is practically parallel to the sorter pocket . the portion of the groove designated 23a is not needed in the shown embodiment , but this allows sheets to be delivered vertically downwardly in another arrangement of the sorting apparatus s1 . to the extent that it is desired , another photocell can be assigned to the feed channel 7 itself and arranged in the vicinity of its outlet side or at the outlet from the rollers 12 , 13 . the other photocell can accordingly replace a portion of the timing circuit and can supply a signal to the control 33 when the end of the sheet passes in order to stop the electric motor 28 and particularly to swivel the feed channel back into the initial position . it is possible to control the beginning of the swiveling movements of the feed channel over time instead of by means of sensing devices or photocells . in the embodiment shown , it is assumed that the electric motor 28 is immediately started up as soon as the photocell 48 , 49 signals the arrival of a new sheet in the feed path 5 so that the rollers 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 are driven in the forward rotational direction . the rollers , in any event , are already rotating when the sheet arrives at the inlet end 8 of the feed channel . however , it should be appreciated that for the purpose of aligning or properly positioning the sheet , or to avoid a slanted introduction into the feed channel 7 , it is also possible to drive the roller first with a time delay , to wit , in such a manner that the sheet with its leading edge in the gap strikes the rollers 9 , 10 which are then still at rest . the leading edge of the sheet then aligns itself in known manner parallel to the rollers 9 , 10 while there occurs in the sheet a certain bulging . after the delay time is over , the electric motor 28 starts up the rollers in the forward rotational direction so that the rollers 8 , 9 draw the sheet in an aligned position , into the feed channel 7 . in order to obtain the same result , it is also possible to utilize the corresponding signal of the photocell 48 , 49 by the control 33 for the driving of the electric motor 28 in a reverse rotational direction . in such a case , when the sheet with its leading edge reaches the rollers 9 , 10 , the latter are then already in motion in a reverse rotational direction . since the sheet cannot enter the feed channel 7 , it bulges and the leading edge of the sheet aligns itself parallel to the rollers 9 , 10 . after a corresponding time delay , the control 33 switches the electric motor 28 to reverse again and the sheet is drawn in , in aligned position , by the rollers which now rotate in the forward rotational direction . as explained above , the sheet can be removed or ejected from the feed channel with a higher speed than the speed at which the sheet is drawn into the feed channel . by this means it is possible to shorten the time necessary for the sorting procedure . this is of importance particularly if output sites are present which make it necessary to tilt the feed channel about larger angles . it should also be pointed out that wear on the members or elements which are driven by the electric motor 28 can be significantly reduced in that the motor is only switched on during the feeding of a sheet . this also of course reduces the current consumption of the apparatus . instead of operating the apparatus so that the sorter or sorters obtain a sorting signal from the sheet delivering printer for each sheet , it is also feasible to design the control 33 in such a manner wherein a corresponding number of output sites are started up one after the other in a predetermined sequence , for example corresponding to a number of copies or sheets generated by the printer . while a specific embodiment of the invention has been shown and described in detail to illustrate the application of the inventive principles , it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles .",6

"a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings . in the following description , same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements even in different drawings . the matters defined in the description such as a detailed construction and elements of a circuit are nothing but the ones provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of the invention . thus , it is apparent that the present invention can be carried out without those defined matters . also , well - known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail . fig1 is a circuit diagram illustrating a construction of an inverter for lcd backlight according to the present invention . referring to fig1 the inverter for lcd backlight comprises a dc / ac converter 10 for performing a voltage transformation and operating a lamp , and a buck switch q 1 connected between an operational power vin and the dc / ac converter 10 for applying the operational power vin to the dc / ac converter 10 by performing on / off operations in accordance with an inputted control signal . the on / off control of the buck switch q 1 is performed by a dimming control . a dimming mode control section identified by the drawing reference numeral 100 in fig1 performs a pwm dimming control , an analog dimming control and a complex control according to the present invention . the drawing reference numeral op 1 in fig1 refers to an error amplifier for receiving a feedback signal f / b of the feedback part connected to a lamp by means of an inverting □ terminal and a signal a outputted from a first output terminal of the dimming control section 100 by means of a non - inverting + terminal , and comparing the feedback signal f / b with the signal a so as to output a compared result . the drawing reference numeral c 1 refers to a capacitor connected to an output terminal of the error amplifier op 1 and the non - inverting terminal . the drawing reference numeral op 3 refers to a second comparator for receiving an output signal of the error amplifier op 1 through the non - inverting + terminal and receiving an oscillating signal of an oscillator through the inverting − terminal so as to compare the two signals and control on / off operations of the buck switch q 1 in accordance with the compared result . the drawing reference numeral q 2 refers to a transistor for performing a function of a switching element by being connected between the output terminal and the ground terminal of the error amplifier op 1 . the drawing reference numeral op 2 refers to a first comparator for receiving a pyramidal wave having a predetermined cycle by means of the non - inverting + terminal , receiving a signal b outputted from the second output terminal of the dimming mode control section 100 , comparing the two signals , and supplying the compared signal to a base terminal of the transistor q 2 so that the output signal of the error amplifier op 1 can be switched on / off by switching on / off the transistor q 2 . an operation of the present invention having the above construction will now be described with reference to fig2 to 5 . an f / b terminal determines an output of the error amplifier op 1 by converging the voltage outputted from the first output terminal a of the dimming control section 100 in accordance with the range of the voltage . the dimming control section 100 controls the signal waveforms ( refer to the drawing reference numerals a , b in fig2 to 4 ) outputted from the first output terminal a and the second output terminal b thereof in accordance with the input conditions of the first dimming signal or the second dimming signal so as to be operated within the analog dimming range or the pwm dimming range . an analog dimming operation will now be described with reference to fig2 . if the voltage loaded on the mode selecting terminal ms of the dimming control section 100 is selected to be a ground potential , the dimming control section 100 recognizes the ground potential as an analog dimming mode , and outputs lineally escalating signals as identified by the drawing reference numerals “ a ” and “ b ” at the first output terminal a and the second output terminal b in accordance with variation of the first dimming signal ds 1 or the second dimming signal ds 2 . therefore , the pyramidal wave ( the drawing reference numeral “ c ” in fig2 ) is loaded as a ground potential to operate the pwm applied to the non - inverting data input terminal + of the first comparator op 2 . the output of the error amplifier op 1 is controlled by the signal ( the drawing reference numeral “ a ” in fig2 ) outputted from the first output terminal a of the dimming control section 100 when q 2 is off . subsequently , the output signal of the second comparator op 3 for controlling on / off of the buck switch q 1 is controlled by the signal ( identified by the drawing reference numeral osc in fig2 ) applied to the inverting terminal of the second comparator op 3 . thus , a pulse signal having a regular cycle is generated as a device output signal , as shown in fig2 to perform an analog dimming control . a pwm dimming operation will now be described with reference to fig3 . if the voltage loaded on the mode selecting terminal ms of the dimming control section is selected as a reference potential , the dimming control section 100 recognizes the reference potential as a pwm dimming mode , and outputs signals varying as identified by the drawing reference numerals “ a ” and “ b ” in fig3 at the second output terminal b . in other words , the signal “ a ” outputted from the first output terminal a maintains the voltage of a high level , while the signal “ b ” outputted from the second output terminal b is lineally varied . as a consequence , the pyramidal wave ( identified by the drawing reference numeral “ c ” in fig3 ) is of a waveform having a substantially regular cycle to perform the pwm operation applied to the non - inverting data input terminal + of the first comparator op 2 . the output signal of the first comparator op 2 does takes a waveform of a synthesized pulse rather than of a regular cycle due to the signal “ b ” outputted from the lineally escalating second output terminal b . the output of the error amplifier op 1 is always in a high state due to the signal “ a ” outputted from the first output terminal a . therefore , the signal actually applied to the non - inverting data input terminal of the second comparator op 3 is variable in accordance with the on / off operation of the transistor q 2 . to be specific , the transistor q 2 is switched on / off by the output signal of the first comparator op 2 . as a consequence , the signal applied to the non - inverting data input terminal of the second comparator op 3 is referred to “ err 1 out ” in fig3 . therefore , the output signal of the second comparator op 3 for controlling on / off of the buck switch q 1 is controlled by a value comparing the signal ( identified by the drawing reference numeral osc in fig3 ) applied to the inverting terminal of the second comparator op 3 with the signal ( identified by the drawing reference numeral err 1 out in fig3 ) applied to the non - inverting data input terminal of the second comparator op 3 . as a result , a pulse signal referred to as an “ out driver ” in fig3 is outputted to perform a pwm dimming control . a complex dimming control will now be described with reference to fig4 and 5 . the f / b terminal determines an output of the error amplifier op 1 by converging the voltage outputted from the first output terminal a of the dimming control section 100 in accordance with the range of the voltage . the dimming control section 100 controls the signal waveforms “ a ” and “ b ” outputted from the first output terminal a and the second output terminal b of the dimming control section 100 in accordance with the input conditions of the first dimming signal or the second dimming signal so as to be operated in the analog dimming range or the pwm dimming range . the pyramidal wave applied to the non - inverting data input terminal + of the first comparator op 2 is a waveform generated to operate the pwm in the pwm dimming range . when operated in the analog dimming range due to variation of the first dimming signal or the second dimming signal , the signals “ a ” and “ b ” outputted from the first output terminal a and the second output terminal b are lineally varied to control an output of the error amplifier op 1 . when operated in the pwm dimming range due to variation of the first dimming signal or the second dimming signal , the signal “ b ” outputted from the second output terminal b lineally operates , while the signal “ a ” outputted from the first output terminal a operates under a predetermined voltage so as to control an output of the error amplifier op 1 . therefore , the output of the first comparator op 2 performs a pwm operation with the on / off operation of the first switch q 1 in accordance with the duty variation of a circular wave . fig4 shows chronological variation of the dimming signal in the pwm operational range and the analog operational range . fig5 shows the dimming control section according to an embodiment of the present invention . when q 3 is switched off , the potential of the signal outputted from the first output terminal a is fixed due to the resistance ratio between the first resistor r 1 and the second resistor r 2 , and q 3 operates in the pwm dimming range from this stage . on the other hand , when the switching element identified as q 3 in fig5 is switched on , the potential of the signal “ a ” outputted from the first output terminal a is varied , and q 3 operates in the analog dimming range from this stage . in short , as shown in fig4 the dimming signal “ b ” of the lineal state performs the pwm dimming control until the point of time when the compared value , which is an output signal of the first comparator op 2 compared with the pyramidal wave of a regular cycle , is converted from a pulse to a ground potential . from the moment when the output signal of the first comparator op 2 has the ground potential , the dimming signal “ b ” follows the analog dimming control method . substantially , the point of time requiring the analog dimming is detected by reference to the dimming signal “ b ” and the pyramidal wave of a lineal state . the potential of the signal “ a ” outputted from the first output terminal a of the dimming control section 100 is varied at the point of detecting time . as a consequence , q 3 operates in the analog dimming range . fig5 is a schematic view showing an example of a minimum construction , rather than an actual construction , of an integrated circuit to perform a function of controlling the dimming mode control according to the present invention . referring to fig5 the integrated circuit comprises : a comparator for comparing the first dimming signal ds 1 with a reference signal , outputting the compared signal and feeding back the signal state of the second dimming signal ds 2 connected to the output terminal or the output signal per se to consider the state of the output signal ; a first circuit section for controlling the state of a signal outputted to the second output terminal b by reference to the signal loaded on the output terminal of the comparator ; a mode selecting section for controlling the state of a signal outputted to the third output terminal c b means of a mode selection signal ms , and controlling the state of an output signal from the first output terminal a ; and a second circuit section for generating a signal to distinguish the analog dimming from the pwm dimming by means of the mode selection control signal so as to be outputted through the fist output terminal a . the above construction is a description made from the functional point of view without considering any drawing reference numerals in fig5 . such a construction can be realized with a microcomputer , and a detailed cooperative relationship will be omitted here . as described above , the inverter for lcd backlight according to the present invention has advantageous effects of realizing a pwm dimming and an analog dimming by switching on / off an error amplifier without switching on / off an ic power as well as of stabilizing a circuit by reducing variation of the power and enhancing reliability of the ic . while the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain embodiment thereof , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims .",6

"the required properties of a hot work forging die have been well developed from years of experience . such a die must have substantial strength since it is subjected to heavy stresses in the forging operation and substantial hardness to insure against premature wear . it must also have good toughness to withstand the heavy and continuous shock loads to which it is subjected in use . due to the elevated temperatures to which it is exposed in use the die must be resistant to softening and heat checking . abrasion resistance is also a critical factor , since in use the sliding forces exerted on the surface at elevated temperatures are very substantial . and finally , the hardenability of the die must be as high and as uniform as possible within cost , toughness and heat treatment limits . in practice , the cavity initially sunk in the die block from which the die is made eventually wears oversized through use . when the maximum tolerance has been reached the die is removed , the face is cut down to sound metal , and the cavity resunk in the remaining material . this may be repeated several times before the useful life of the die is exhausted . the cost of the dies , including initial cost , hammer and press down time for removal , machining and installation requires that maximum production be obtained after each re - sinking . now , if the die has sufficient strength and toughness to remain in service without fracture , the most important use requirement is that the die be of substantially uniform hardness throughout so the production that can be expected from the last sinking is as great as can be expected from the initial sinking . a hot work forging implement was prepared in accordance with the invention as follows . on the basis of experience , it was determined that a c content of very close to 0 . 55 was best suited for this application . c , of course , provides strength and hardness to the die block . by long usage , a broad range of 0 . 50 - 0 . 60 c has been employed , and , on occasion , an intermediate range of 0 . 53 - 0 . 57 c . si was specified at 0 . 22 , again based on long experience which indicates that this amount of si contributes to cleanliness and deoxidation in the steel making process . the usual si range for this die block usage is 0 . 15 - 0 . 35 . a minimum of 0 . 50 ni is required to impart toughness to the steel , again based on experience . a minimum of 0 . 50 cr is required , based on experience , because of the beneficial effect cr exerts on deep hardening , wear resistance , tempering resistance , and the elevation of the lower critical temperature . a minimum of 0 . 20 mo is required , again based on experience , due to its ability to resist softening in use , for wear resistance , and hardenability . and finally , mn should be present because of its very effective depth hardening ability . if present in quantities very significantly above about 2 %, deleterious effects may be encountered , but up to this limit nearly any amount of manganese will exert a beneficial effect on hardenability and control sulfide hot shortness . now , it has long been known that hardenability can be measured and expressed mathematically , ( i . e . : by the formula log d i = log f c + log f si + log f ni + log f cr + log f mo + log f x , wherein the expression d i represents the ideal critical diameter , and the expressions f c , f si , f ni , f cr , f mo , and f x are factors which represent the hardenability contribution of each of the elements identified by the chemical symbol in the subscript and , with respect to f x , all other elements which may be present and which contribute to hardenability , all as exemplified by the example on page 78 of republic alloy steels , 1961 , republic steel corporation , cleveland , ohio ,) and related to the ability of a die steel to give satisfactory performance . for example , the ideal critical diameter , hereafter referred to by its conventional abbreviation d i , is often used as a measure of hardenability . long experience in die steel usage has disclosed that a minimum d i of 9 is desirable for satisfactory die steel performance . for a more detailed discussion of hardenability and d i , see republic alloy steels , 1961 , republic steel corporation , cleveland , ohio , pages 75 - 102 , wherein it will be noted that the ideal critical diameter can be defined as the diameter of a round which , if quenched in a perfect quench , will harden to 50 % martinsite at the center . for purposes of this invention , however , the mathematical determination of the d i as derived from calculations based on chemical composition is of basic importance , rather than any specific measurement of diameter . after determination of ( a ) the alloy element or elements which must be present to make possible the attainment of the required use properties -- here c , si , ni , cr , mo and mn , and ( b ) the minimum amounts of the most expensive of those elements , in addition to carbon , which must be provided to attain the required end use properties , -- here ni , cr and mo , and ( c ) the d i required , the method of obtaining the required d i is as follows : the d i factor attributable to each of c and the essential elements is determined . this is done by reference to a table giving the hardenability factor attributable to each alloy and level , adding the hardenability factor for the required c content and the hardenability factors for the aim , or required minimums , of the essential alloys ( here si , ni , cr and mo ), determining the hardenability factor for the required d i ( here 9 ), determining the difference , if any , between ( a ) the hardenability factor of the required d i and ( b ) the sum of the hardenability factors for carbon and the essential alloys , and , if ( b ) is less than ( a ), determining the amount of the least expensive alloy capable of exerting a beneficial effect on hardenability , here manganese , corresponding to the aforesaid difference . in the event a maximum practical upper limit of the first hardenability make - up element is reached for any reason , such as refractory attack in the case of manganese , before the required d i is achieved , the hardenability make - up element selection process may be repeated with successively more expensive elements as often as needed to reach the required d i . in the die steel of the present invention the order of addition of hardenability make - up elements on a lowest to highest cost basis would be manganese , chromium , nickel and molybdenum . to further illustrate , and referring to a conventional hardenability characteristics of alloys table and a conventional hardenability characteristics / d i conversion table , such as is found on pages 78 and 79 of the aforesaid reference , and a standard log / anti - log table if required , the sum of the hardenability factors corresponding to a d i of 9 is determined , which determination is derived from the sum of 1 + log 10 d i , namely 1 . 954 . thereafter the hardenability factors for 0 . 55 c , 0 . 22 si , 0 . 5 ni , 0 . 5 cr , and 0 . 2 mo , are determined from the table as follows : hardenabilityelement amount , % factors______________________________________c . 55 . 400si . 22 . 062ni . 5 . 073cr . 5 . 318mo . 2 . 204 sum 1 . 057______________________________________ their sum , 1 . 057 , is subtracted from 1 . 954 to determine the difference of 0 . 897 . since the hardenability factor for mn of 0 . 897 corresponds to 1 . 76 % mn , the steelmaker has determined that 1 . 76 % mn must be present to achieve a desired d i of 9 . if the foregoing calculation indicates that more manganese must be present than would be desirable , such as , for example , a process limitation based on excessive refractory attack due to a high manganese content , then only that quantity of manganese would be added which would avoid refractory attack , and the next least expensive hardenability make - up element , here chromium , would be added to achieve the required d i . first , the hardenability characteristics for c varies slightly with grain size . for calculation purposes a grain size of astm no . 7 is assumed . however , at least in the medium carbon range the variation in the hardenability factor due to grain size is not sufficiently great to significantly deleteriously affect the final result . hence grain size , as a factor , may be disregarded . secondly , since a carbon aim of 0 . 55 is desired , the calculations may be simplified by eliminating c and its hardenability factor ( here 0 . 400 ) from the equation , that is , by reducing the hardenability factor aim of 1 . 954 ( for a d i of 9 ) to 1 . 554 , and then ignoring carbon in subsequent calculations . this results in requiring calculations only for the less controllable elements such as si , cr , ni , mo and v . if the steelmaker is unable to achieve ideal control over other elements , such as si , the factor for such additional element or elements may be eliminated by an aim . as a further example , the following explanation is given of how to carry out the method of this invention . a heat of about 65 tons of steel was melted in an electric furnace with the following aim chemistry specification : c . 55 aim mn 2 max . p . 035 max . s . 035 max . si . 22 aim ni . 50 min . cr . 50 min . mo . 20 min . v residual al . 02 the charge consisted substantially of scrap principally containing the above elements . just prior to tap the heat was analysed to determine if the ladle composition would include ni - 0 . 50 min ., cr - 0 . 50 min ., and mo - 0 . 20 min . thereafter , upon determination that one or more of the three aforesaid elements would not reach ladle specifications as mentioned in the preceding paragraph , additions were made to bring the ladle composition to the desired minimums . thereafter a final analysis for ni , cr , mo and v ( in short , all elements which contribute to d i except p and s , which roughly cancel one another ) was made to ensure the ladle composition would satisfy the minimum requirements and determine the hardenability contributions of other elements in addition to ni , cr , mo and v which are present . thereafter the expected alloy hops were added . as those skilled in the art will appreciate , alloy hops are the difference in composition between the measured element at final in furnace and at the ladle sample which occur without deliberate addition , particularly in vacuum degassed steels as a result of the reduction of alloys in the slag into the bath due to the degassing process . thereafter , the hardenability factors for ni , cr , mo and v were determined from a hardenability characteristic table and added . thereafter the sum was subtracted from 1 . 492 which represents a d i of 9 less the hardenability factors for 0 . 55 c and 0 . 22 si . a mn content corresponding to the difference determined in the preceding step was then determined , and the difference between this quantity of mn and the measured mn was added to the furnace just prior to tap . normal post - tap procedures were followed to reach 0 . 55 c aim and 0 . 22 si aim , and the steel was vacuum degassed . following is a table of heats of steel which were melted according to the foregoing procedure . table i__________________________________________________________________________heat no . c mn p s si ni cr mo v al di__________________________________________________________________________118 , 125 . 56 . 88 . 019 . 030 . 28 . 92 . 81 . 33 . 023 . 036 11 . 22118 , 115 . 53 . 53 . 018 . 033 . 31 . 92 . 97 . 34 . 040 . 005 9 . 68118 , 101 . 55 . 86 . 024 . 024 . 29 . 65 . 85 . 28 . 027 . 032 10 . 09228 , 028 . 53 . 84 . 024 . 032 . 28 . 87 . 78 . 33 . 045 . 004 11 . 04128 , 251 . 50 . 79 . 024 . 035 . 24 . 79 . 90 . 34 . 040 . 026 10 . 84227 , 985 . 55 . 93 . 021 . 031 . 30 . 81 . 90 . 29 . 027 . 024 11 . 85217 , 968 . 57 1 . 04 . 025 . 035 . 30 . 72 . 80 . 31 . 020 . 016 11 . 51118 , 158 . 57 . 79 . 024 . 025 . 31 . 80 . 93 . 33 . 028 . 020 11 . 75128 , 407 . 54 . 56 . 019 . 030 . 33 . 65 1 . 02 . 36 . 030 . 026 9 . 91228 , 123 . 53 . 72 . 023 . 030 . 30 . 80 . 97 . 35 . 034 . 012 11 . 48228 , 117 . 50 . 85 . 024 . 033 . 23 . 84 . 90 . 33 . 025 . 008 10 . 62128 , 339 . 55 . 69 . 022 . 027 . 32 . 92 . 96 . 33 . 026 . 012 10 . 96128 , 289 . 50 1 . 02 . 017 . 035 . 29 . 59 . 80 . 32 . 035 . 018 11 . 35__________________________________________________________________________ in another test a heat was prepared in accordance with the foregoing procedure to the following final chemistry ( heat no . 117 , 905 ). heat treatment to an aim of bhn 352 was employed . ______________________________________ c . 55 mn 1 . 20 p . 024 s . 029 si . 28 ni 1 . 01 cr . 77 mo . 27 v . 033 al . 013______________________________________ the steel was vacuum degassed in the ladle using a purging gas by a process generally illustrated and described in u . s . pat . no . 3 , 236 , 635 , although this procedure is not considered mandatory . the after -

"in order to achieve the advantageous results of the invention , it is crucial that the specific gravity be within a range which is effective to cause the beads to separate . if the specific gravity is too low , the beads will neither separate at the surface of the solution nor from the mold . if the specific gravity is too high , the beads will not form a layer separate from the mold or at the surface of the liquid . moreover , to the extent that the mixture of beads and mold float in the same layer , the layer will not separate at the surface of the liquid and the polymer beads cannot be recovered . suitable for use as nonionic adsorbents are porous fine particles having a large specific surface area and consisting of various synthetic resins , such as , polymers of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of styrene , divinylbenzene , and acrylic esters . specific examples include adsorbents composed of styrene - divinylbenzene type synthetic resins , for example hp - 10 , hp - 20 , hp - 30 , hp - 40 , and hp - 50 , produced by mitsubishi kasei corporation ; amberlite xad - 2 and xad - 4 , produced by rohm and haas co . ; adsorbents composed of acrylic ester type resins , for example , amberlite xas - 7 , produced by rohm and haas co . ; and the like . particularly preferred among these nonionic adsorbents are those having a particle size of form about 50 to about 1 , 000 μm , a specific surface area of from about 50 to about 1 , 000 m 2 / g and a pore volume of from about 0 . 2 to about 1 . 5 ml / g . the specific gravity range which is effective to accomplish the desired result will vary depending on the particular nature of the broth , the mold and the beads . generally , we have found that a specific gravity range of from about 1 . 05 to about 1 . 20 is preferred . the specific gravity of the broth may be adjusted to the required value by the addition of an appropriate water soluble material , such as , an inorganic salt or an organic compound which is effective to change the specific gravity of the solution . typical of such salts and compounds are nacl , kcl , na 2 so 4 , mgso 4 , glycerol , glucose , sucrose , and combinations thereof . nacl is the most preferred material because it is the most economical . the absorbent polymer beads ( resin ) with the antibiotic adsorbed thereon can be recovered by physically separating the upper layer , e . g ., by filtration , decanting , and the like . the separated beads can then be washed with water , dried , and then subjected to an extraction step to extract the antibiotic . of course , any drying step would be carried out at a temperature which would not be adverse to either the beads or the antibiotic , e . g ., under 40 ° c . the raw antibiotics thus obtained can be subjected to conventional column - chromatographic purification directly , without recrystallization or reprecipitation . the extracted polymer beads can be re - used by removing the organic solvent , for example , by evaporation and then boiling with water . a sterile medium ( seed medium ) having the following composition was prepared in a 500 ml . flask , inoculated with streptomyces spectabilis atcc27465 , and incubated for 72 hours at 27 ° c . on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm . to produce a seed culture . ______________________________________seed medium : ______________________________________hydrolysed casein ( n -

"the present invention relates generally to a method and system for detecting or reviewing defective contacts in the fabrication of semi - conductor devices by using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ). the following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements . various modifications to the preferred embodiments and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art . thus , the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown , but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein . a system and method in accordance with the present invention overcomes the above described problem and provides a method to identify open contacts on dram or the like structure , in which source and / or drain contacts constitute an array and share one or multiple common control gates . defective contacts can be identified with the sem utilizing a positive ( extraction field ) mode or a negative ( retarding field ) mode . to describe these modes in more detail refer to the following discussion in conjunction with the accompanying figures . a first conventional embodiment uses the positive mode with the landing energy ( fig2 ) le in between e 1 and e 2 . since a modern low landing energy sem tends to negatively bias the wafer ( refers to 310 of fig3 ), or stage ( not show ) with respected to the final objective lens 311 to reduce the landing energy , there is naturally an extraction field imposed between the wafer 302 and sem column 311 . if the primary electron beam operates in a positive mode region , the sample surface tends to be charged up positively while scanning . open contacts hold positive charges which attract ses , thus making the contact appear dark in the voltage contrast image . fig3 illustrates different effects of positive mode on nmos and pmos transistors 302 a and 302 b . for the nmos transistor 302 a , a positive surface charging imposes a reverse biased voltage on the associated pn - junction by primary beam scanning , which switches off the pn - junction . for normal contact 308 a and open contact 309 a , no significant different in signal can be made as indicated by 304 and 305 . for the pmos transistor 302 b , a positive surface charge voltage (& gt ; 0 . 7v ) is induced to switch on the associated pn - junction , excessive charges on normal contacts will be released to the n - well , which contributes more se signals 306 from the surface . contrary to the normal contact 308 b , an open contact 309 b retains secondary electrons , as indicated by 307 , thus making the contact appear dark in the voltage contrast image . instead of achieving a positive surface charging , a second conventional embodiment operates in a negative mode with a landing energy greater than e 2 . as a result , negative charging is induced on the surface . if the charging cannot be released in time as in the case of the open contact , more ses are generated and repelled in the proximity towards the detector , and therefore the open contact appears brighter than normal . fig4 , which illustrates the second conventional embodiment , depicts the effects of a negative mode on nmos and pmos transistors 402 a and 402 b . in the case of an nmos transistor 402 a , the negative charging voltage on the n + plug can be strong enough to offset the global extraction field and forward bias the associated pn - junction . excessive charges on the normal contact 408 a will be released via the pn - junction resulting in less se signals as indicated by 404 . this differentiates open contact 409 a from normal contact 408 a in a nmos transistor 402 a . in the case of a pmos transistor 402 b , negative mode simply sets the corresponding pn - junction to reverse bias , and therefore signals 406 and 407 from normal contact 409 b and open contact 408 b respectively cannot be differentiated effectively . u . s . pat . no . 4 , 843 , 330 introduced a grid at a proximal distance above the wafer and which can be independently biased positive or negatively with respect to the wafer substrate or stage . this makes it possible to locally create an extraction or retarding field above the wafer to affect the collection of secondary electrons and the charging of wafer surface . postek in “ critical issues in scanning electron microscope metrology ”, j . res . natl . inst . stand . technol . 99 , 641 ( 1994 ), pp . 662 , reported a similar approach by hitachi using an electrode to control the local field , enhancing the collection of se . paul ( u . s . pat . no . 6 , 720 , 779 ) claimed a method which utilizes a much higher extraction field to trigger the reverse biased pn - junction to junction breakdown . fig5 shows a third conventional embodiment which illustrates the application of an extraction field mode to nmos and pmos transistors 502 a and 502 b . by increasing the positive bias voltage 510 on the grid 512 located between the objective lens 511 and the wafer 502 , an extraction field is imposed on wafer surface . as it increases , the pn - junction of nmos transistor 502 a is set in close proximity to reverse breakdown . excessive positive charges on the normal contact 508 a will trigger the junction leak , thus the contact no longer accumulates charge . this lack of accumulation differentiates the signals 505 of an open contact 509 a from signals 504 of a normal contact 508 a for nmos . with this embodiment , the open contacts 509 a and 509 b of both nmos transistor 502 a and pmos transistor 502 b can be identified as dark voltage contrast images due to their relatively weak se signals 505 and 507 compared to normal signals 504 and 506 . the third conventional embodiment overcomes the difficulty of the second conventional embodiment . however , there is a high risk of electrical arcing over the rough surface due to the strong extraction field , which can reach voltages up to and beyond 1000v / mm . also , the pn - junction sometimes may be over stressed causing permanent damage . a fourth conventional embodiment as shown in fig6 biases the grid 612 at a negative voltage 610 with respect to the wafer 602 . retarding field helps provide a negative charge to the wafer surface and contacts , resulting in a forward bias voltage on the pn - junctions of nmos 602 a . the pn - junction is turned on and drains away excessive charges , resulting less se signals 604 from a normal contact 608 a . for an open contact 609 a , charges accumulate continuously to reduce the retarding field , and as a result more se 605 can escape from the surface and show as bright vc . this embodiment is not sensitive enough for the detecting or reviewing of open contacts to pmos devices . the negative mode in the second conventional embodiment of fig4 and the retarding field mode in the fourth conventional embodiment of fig6 both rely on the primary electron beam as the source for surface negative charging . simultaneously the difference of surface charging is also sensed by the same primary electron beam . the multiple tasks imposed on the primary beam sometimes cannot be fully accomplished at a given sampling time , and therefore multiple scans must be utilized resulting in a trade off in throughput . u . s . pat . no . 4 , 417 , 203 describes a second source of electron beam , called a flood gun , to create a negative charging on the wafer surface in advance prior to imaging , as indicated by 713 in fig7 . this patent is consistent with the second conventional embodiment of fig4 and the fourth conventional embodiment of fig6 in realizing a negative charged surface . if combined together with properly optimized conditions , the detecting or reviewing of the open contact to the nmos transistor will be more effective and sensitive . fig7 shows the combination as a fifth conventional embodiment . similar to the second conventional embodiment of fig4 , the fourth and fifth conventional embodiments of fig6 and 7 provide a better indication of an open contact to an nmos device . but there are other issues which arise from utilizing a strong retarding field : se signals are significantly suppressed and signal to noise ratio is relative low . furthermore , the developing of negative surface charging is difficult to control and maintain in a uniform and stable state . fig8 illustrates a memory cell utilized in a dram . a memory cell comprises a nmos transistor 802 and a capacitor 804 . for a deep trench dram , the capacitor and gate are formed at the early process steps , thus they are buried in a dielectric layer . if the relevant pn - junction leak current 914 is minimal , fig9 illustrates the difficulties in producing difference between signal 903 from a normal bit contact 909 and 905 from an open bit contact 908 . a method and system in accordance with the present invention overcoming the above - described problems and provides a method and system for detecting or reviewing open contacts on a semiconductor device such as a dram . in general for the method and system , two steps of scanning are involved with either one or two sources of beams : the first source is of primary electron beam for imaging ; the second source is an accessory beam can be either an electron beam , ion beam , or laser beam for pre - charging the device into expected status . in one embodiment , a method is disclosed which comprises scanning a specific area of common gate contacts of mos devices with second source of beam a plurality of times , until the gate is positively charged enough over a threshold voltage . then scanning the associated source and / or drain contacts with first beam source in order to excite se signals and form a voltage contrast image . the image is then analyzed to observe the grey level of the contact to reveal the difference in electrical properties , or the scanned image is compared with a reference image to detect contacts with an abnormal grey level as defective contacts . in another embodiment , a method is disclosed which comprises scanning the gate contact area and source and / or drain contact area simultaneously with an accessory beam a plurality of times . then scanning the source and / or drain contacts with the first beam source in order to excite se signals and form a voltage contrast image . the image is then analyzed to observe the grey level of the contact to reveal the electrical properties difference quantitatively , or the scanned image is compared with a reference image to detect contacts which display an abnormal grey level as defective cells . to describe the features of the present invention in more detail , refer now to the following discussion in conjunction with the accompanying figures . memory cells are arranged into rows and columns to form a memory array . fig1 shows the layout 1000 of a cell array in folded architecture , as well as an example of cross - sections 1002 at the manufacturing step of the bit contact layer . word lines 1003 connect the columns of the memory array , and bit lines 1004 connect the rows of bit contact of the memory array . a word line decoder ( not shown ) is connected to the word lines for selecting one of the word lines . a sense amplifier ( not shown ) is connected to the bit lines to sense a voltage change on the bit line in an array . fig1 illustrates complete sub - array circuitry architecture 1100 . a dram operates by sending a charge through the appropriate contacts to the world line to activate the transistor at each bit . when writing , the bit lines contain the state that the capacitor should hold . when reading , the sense - amplifier determines the level of charge in the capacitor . during deep trench dram manufacturing , when the manufacturing process reaches the bit contact layer step , both the world line and the cell capacitor have been already fabricated and buried in the dielectric . from the top layer , an sem image can only resolve the bit contacts and other contacts of control circuitry . fig1 shows the top view of cell arrays and word line decoder circuitry . the gate of cells along a word line can only be accessed via word line contacts . as defined hereinbefore , conventional approaches focus on ways to manipulate the associated pn - junctions into different kinds of mode or status . they all exhibit ineffectiveness in identifying open bit contacts at the bit contact layer . for a deep trench dram , the buried capacitor causes the source and / or drain of the nmos cell to have an unbalanced connection . when a scanning process is carried out utilizing an electron beam , charging over the source and / or drain will result in a potential drop between them . if the there is way to turn the nmos cell into expected status , it will create an opportunity for detecting or reviewing the open bit contacts . if the cell gates are turned off , each bit contact is isolated from its cell capacitor . when scanning the cell array solely by primary electron beam , the charges induced on the cells , with reference to fig9 , cannot drain to the cell capacitors even if the contact is normal . this makes an open bit contact 909 indistinguishable from a normal bit contact 908 . if a cell gate is turned on , i . e ., the word line 1307 , as shown in fig1 , is positively charged over vdd , an inversion layer 1306 is created below the gate , wherein electrons are the dominant carrier in the narrow band . by scanning the cell array with a primary beam of proper landing energy , positive charging can be generated on the bit contacts . for a normal contact 1308 , positive charges drain to their capacitors via the inversion layer 1306 , while for open contact 1309 , charges accumulate . positive charging results in a relatively weak se signal 1303 compared to 1305 , thus the open contact 1309 should appear dark from a voltage contrast image . accordingly , it is desirable to image bit contacts with gate turned on . detecting or reviewing open bit contacts at bit contact layer generally involves two separate steps for a complete sequence as shown in fig1 . in a first step 1402 , the gate contacts are precharged to introduce a positive charge on the word lines which are high enough to turn on the transistor . unlike the cell capacitors which leak the charging in pico - seconds , the resulting positive charging on word lines can be held for a significant period of time , for instance tens of minutes or hours at vacuum . the second step 1404 is to scan the relevant bit contacts over the cell array with a primary electron beam to simulate the process of writing and capture an se image simultaneously . it is necessary to use a proper landing energy between e 1 and e 2 for the bit contact material used , so that positive charges can be induced . this is equivalent to charging up the cell for writing . if a bit contact is normal , the charging will be written to its corresponding cell capacitor . since the bit contact capacitor is so large with respect to the charging current , or the leakage is so significant that capacitor cannot be charged to full capacity within given scan rate or pixel dwelling time , the contact will remain at low voltage . if there is an open contact , the charge on the contact cannot release to the cell capacitor , thus makes the open contact appears relatively darker than normal . fig1 a and 15 b show the images of the cell array an open bit contact before ( 1502 a ) and after ( 1502 b ) word lines are activated . as is seen , the normal contacts 1504 are turned from dark 1504 b to bright 1504 a after activating gate , making the open contact 1506 stand out apparently as a dark vc . in one embodiment the dram or the like structure can be part of a test structure in which the source and / or drain contacts constitute an array and share one or multiple common gates . utilizing a system and method in accordance with the present invention allows for a more efficient detecting or reviewing of the electrical defects occurring in the relevant process . there are multiple embodiments which may be utilized to achieve the pre - charge of the word line over the word line decoder circuitry . according to one embodiment , a simple way is to use the same primary electron beam as is utilized in the sem for imaging , with the same beam condition or not , to pre - scan the gate contacts at either the level of decoder circuitry or the entire wafer . the goal is to accumulate enough positive charge voltage on the word line to turn on the gate of each cell . due to the limited primary beam current , the pre - scan may be carried out one or a plurality of times to establish the designated charging voltage . according to a second embodiment , an electron beam originated from a second electron source is used to induce the positive charging voltage on the word line to turn on the turn on the gate of each cell . this electron beam from the secondary source can be controlled with much flexibility , so that the buried word lines can be charged to positive more effectively and efficiently . it can be controlled to scan or irradiate the word line decoder circuitry , the entire sub - array , or the entire wafer , multiple times or a single time . this turns on the gate of each cell and sets up the device condition for the next step of voltage contrast imaging with the primary electron beam . according to a third embodiment , a positive ion beam is used to achieve a positive charge on the buried word lines either by scanning or irradiating gate contacts over word line decoder circuitry , or simply over the entire wafer . this also turns on the gate of each cell and sets up the device condition for the next step of voltage contrast imaging with the primary electron beam . according to a fourth embodiment , an uv light , instead of charged particles , is used to induce a positive charge on the buried word lines . irradiating the gate contacts of decoder or the entire wafer with light rays of wave lengths ranging from 300 nm to 1200 nm , also excites the se , and leaves positive charges behind . the level of positive charging can be controlled by the duration or power of the light . this also turns on the gate of each cell and sets up the device condition for a next step of voltage contrast imaging with the primary electron beam . the electron beam of the secondary source , the ion beam , and the uv light are generally referred as accessory beams hereafter . although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown , one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention . accordingly , many modifications may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims .",6
"with reference to fig7 , a time diversity satellite broadcast system 100 is provided having at least three satellites 102 , 104 and 106 in a non - geostationary constellation . each satellite 102 , 104 and 106 is preferably placed in a tundra orbit whereby each satellite is in an elliptical orbit inclined 63 . 4 degrees relative to the equator . each satellite 102 , 104 and 106 is preferably geosynchronous with a nominal 24 - hour period . in addition , the three orbit planes for the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 are spaced evenly about the earth by approximately 120 degree increments , as illustrated by satellites 20 , 24 and 36 in fig2 , resulting in approximately an eight hour orbital position separation . in accordance with the present invention , two of the three satellites 102 , 104 and 106 are selectively operated in early and late satellite service modes to transmit to , for example , the 48 contiguous united states coverage area at any time . the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 follow a common ground track such as the ground track 60 illustrated in fig3 . as stated above , satellite ground track 60 is a figure - eight , having a northern loop 62 that is smaller than the southern loop 64 . the northern and southern loops 62 and 64 share a crossover point 66 , as shown in fig4 . each satellite 102 , 104 and 106 spends approximately one - third ( e . g ., eight hours ) of its orbit time south of the equator 68 . each satellite is preferably switched off during this time period . each satellite spends two - thirds ( e . g ., sixteen hours ) of its orbit time north of the equator 68 . in addition , each satellite spends eight of those sixteen hours in the smaller northern loop 62 . in addition , the orbital positions of a satellite that correspond to the northern loop 62 of the ground track 60 provide the highest elevation angles when compared to orbital positions corresponding to the southern loop 64 . as shown in fig8 , the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 achieve maximum elevation angles for respective eight hour periods in each 24 - hour orbital period . the present invention takes advantage of these eight hour periods of improved elevation angles by switching the satellite 102 , 104 or 106 that is entering the northern loop of its ground track to late satellite operation . correspondingly , the satellite that is in the southern loop 64 of the ground track 60 and is above the equator is operated as the early satellite . with continued reference to fig7 , a transmitter or uplink center 110 in the system 100 provides a signal such as a multi - channel tdm content signal 112 to a splitter 114 . the splitter 114 , in turn , provides the signal to each of two transmission channels 116 and 118 . the first transmission channel 116 is transmitted at a first frequency f 1 via an uplink component indicated at 120 . the second transmission channel 118 is delayed by a selected time interval , as indicated at 122 , prior to being transmitted to a second satellite at a second frequency f 2 via an uplink component indicated at 124 . a ttc unit 126 is provided which tracks the flight operations of the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 . data from the ttc unit 126 is used to direct the dish 128 associated with the uplink component 120 and the dish 130 associated with the uplink component 124 to the satellite traversing the southern loop 64 ( i . e ., when the satellite is above the equator ) and the satellite traversing the northern loop 62 , respectively , of the ground track 60 . the satellites are depicted in exemplary ground track positions in fig9 , 10 , 11 and 12 for illustrative purposes . in fig9 , the satellite 102 is ascending the southern loop 64 from the equator 68 and is powered on . the satellite 104 is at apogee and operated as the late satellite in accordance with the present invention . the satellite 106 is descending the southern loop 64 below the equator 68 and is therefore being powered down . prior to reaching an orbital position near the equator , the satellite 106 is operated as the early satellite in accordance with the present invention . fig1 depicts the ground track positions of the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 in the illustrated example after four hours of the 24 - hour orbital period have elapsed since the positions depicted in fig9 . once the satellite 102 reaches the crossover point 66 , the uplink component 124 is commanded using data from the ttc unit 126 to re - point its beam from the satellite 104 , which has now also reached the crossover point 66 , to the satellite 102 to operate the satellite 102 as the late satellite while it traverses the northern loop 62 . correspondingly , the uplink component 120 is commanded to re - point its beam from the satellite 102 to the satellite 104 to switch its operation from late to early satellite operation . fig1 depicts the ground track positions of the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 in the illustrated example after another four hours ( i . e ., a total of eight hours ) of the 24 - hour orbital period have elapsed since the positions depicted in fig9 . the satellite 106 is powered on when it commences its ascent of the southern loop 64 above the equator 68 . the early satellite 104 is powered down below the equator 68 . the satellite 102 continues to operate as the late satellite which provides better elevation angles than the other two satellites . fig1 depicts the ground track positions of the satellites 102 , 104 and 106 in the illustrated example after another four hours ( i . e ., a total of twelve hours ) of the 24 - hour orbital period have elapsed since the positions depicted in fig9 . the uplink components 120 and 124 are commanded using data from the ttc unit 126 to re - point their beams to satellites 102 and 106 to operate the satellites 102 and 106 as the early and late satellites , respectively . as stated above , the satellite 104 is powered down at latitudes below the equator 68 . as can be seen from the illustrated example in fig9 - 12 , the satellite traversing the northern loop 62 of the ground track 60 is operated as the late satellite for as many as eight hours until the next satellite commences the northern loop 62 of the ground track 60 . when the satellites are in orbital positions corresponding to the northern loop 62 , they have favorable elevation angles for minimizing the effects of line of sight obstructions , multipath fading and foliage attenuation of the received signal at the receiver 140 in fig7 . in accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention , a satellite receiver tunes to the late satellite signal . since the satellite that is in the orbital positions corresponding to the northern loop of the ground track is selected to be the late satellite , the satellite has improved elevation angles and is therefore less likely to be subjected to line of sight obstruction , multipath fading and foliage attenuation . accordingly , the receiver can employ a relatively small buffer for storing the early satellite signal for a selected channel in the multi - channel tdm content signal for a predetermined period for combining purposes . this is in contrast with conventional receivers that store all channels in the early satellite signal for a selected period of time prior to channel selection , as indicated at 30 in fig1 . as shown in fig7 , a dual arm receiver is tuned to receive the early and late signals from the early and late satellites , respectively . the received signals are downconverted by a downconverter 142 . a channel selector 144 extracts a selected one of the channels in the received signals . the channel selector 144 can operate , for example , in response to a user input . the early signals for the selected channel are provided to a delay unit 146 which needs only be configured to store data from a single channel for a period of time corresponding to the delay imposed on the content 112 by the delay unit 122 in the transmitter 110 . the late signals for the selected channel are provided to a signal combiner 148 , along with the output of the delay unit 146 , and then combined using one or more diversity combining methods to generate a user signal 150 . the need to store all channels at the receiver for a selected amount of time , as explained in connection with conventional receivers and fig1 , is eliminated by the switching operation of the late and early satellites described herein . referring to fig7 , when a new channel is selected via the channel selector 144 , the early signal is applied to the delay buffer 146 at the output of the channel selector , while the late signal is simultaneously applied to the signal combiner 148 . since it is unlikely that the late satellite signal is not received ( i . e ., since it is transmitted from a satellite at a high elevation angle ), the output of the signal combiner immediately provides the new channel contents to the user based on the late signal availability . if the signal from the lower elevation early satellite was available at the output of the channel selector , it exits the delay block 146 and is available to the signal combiner 148 for combination with the late signal after the delay period has elapsed . the advantage of increasing the late signal availability is evident when considering the example of early satellite signal availability only . under this condition with the receiver in fig7 , the early signal will not be available at the signal combiner 148 when a new channel is selected until after the early signal exits the delay block 146 . this results in an interruption of service for the period of the delay block . in the system described in fig1 , all of the channels must be stored ( e . g ., as an early signal for a selected period of time ) to overcome latency problems such as the interruption in service that can occur when the channel is changed , and the late channel is obstructed or severely faded . such conditions have a high probability of occurring when the late satellite is transmitting from lower elevations along the lower loop 64 . although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof , it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the details thereof . various modifications and substitutions have been suggested in the foregoing description , and others will occur to those of ordinary skill in the art . all such substitutions are intended to be embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims .",7
"next , with reference to the accompanying drawings , embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail . with reference to fig2 a first embodiment of the present invention will be described . fig2 shows the structure of a latch circuit and a register circuit . referring to fig2 two stages of latch circuits are connected in series . the first stage of the latch circuit is a master side latch circuit . data is input from an input terminal in . input data is output from a connection point pm . the second stage of the latch circuit is a slave side latch circuit . in data is input from the connection point pm . input data is output from a data output terminal out . first , the master side latch circuit will be described in detail . input data received from the input terminal in is input to an input transfer circuit ( first switch ) composed of a pmos m 1 and an nmos m 2 whose source and drain are connected in parallel , respectively . a clock signal clk is input to the gate of the pmos m 1 . an inversed clock signal clkb of the clock signal clk is output to the gate of the nmos m 2 through an inverter inv 5 . an output terminal of the input transfer circuit is connected to an output driving inverter inv 1 . output data of the inverter inv 1 is output to the connection point pm . output data of the connection point pm is output to a latch pass inverter inv 2 . output data of the inverter inv 2 is output to a hold transfer circuit composed of an nmos m 3 and a pmos m 4 . output data of the hold transfer circuit is output to a connection point pfm that is an input terminal of the inverter inv 1 . here , the inverters inv 1 and inv 2 and the hold transfer circuit m 3 and m 4 construct a hold circuit . a clock signal clk 1 is input to the gate of the nmos m 3 of the hold transfer circuit . an inverted clock signal of the clock signal clk 1 is input to the gate of the pmos m 4 of the hold transfer circuit through an inverter inv 6 . the structure of the master side latch circuit is the same as the structure of the slave side latch circuit . the clock signal clk is input to the gate of an nmos m 5 of an input side transfer circuit . the inverted clock signal clkb of the clock signal clk is input to the gate of a pmos m 6 of the input side transfer circuit . however , a clock signal clk 2 is input to the gate of a pmos m 7 of a hold transfer circuit . an inverted clock signal of the clock signal clk 2 is input to the gate of an nmos m 8 of the hold transfer circuit . ( 2 ) description of operation next , with reference to fig2 the operation of the first embodiment will be descried . when the signal level of the clock signal clk changes from high to low , the input transfer circuit ( ml and m 2 ) of the master side latch circuit is turned on . thus , the input transfer circuit ( m 1 and m 2 ) become the through state . consequently , the input data is input to the connection point pm through an inverter . at this point , since the signal level of the clock signal clk 1 is fixed in the low level , the hold transfer circuit is kept off . on the other hand , when the signal level of the clock signal clk changes from low to high , the input transfer circuit is turned off . thus , the signal level of the connection point pfm becomes floating state . consequently , the voltage of the input data is kept in the level that takes place just before the input transfer circuit is turned off . this state is a latch state . after a predetermined time period elapses , the signal level of the clock signal clk 1 becomes high . thus , the hold transfer circuit is turned on . the input data at the connection point pm is input to the input terminal of the inverter inv 1 . as a result , a flip - flop circuit is structured . thus , data can be held as a circuit . at this point , the output data of the inverter inv 1 is inverted data at the connection point pm . the operation of the slave side latch circuit is the same as the operation of the master side latch circuit except that when the signal level of the clock signal clk becomes high , the slave side latch circuit becomes the through state ; when the signal level of the clock signal clk becomes low , the slave side latch circuit becomes the latch state . in addition , the hold transfer circuit is controlled with the clock signal clk 2 instead of the clock signal clk 1 . however , the controlling method for the hold transfer circuit of the slave side latch circuit is the same as that of the master side latch circuit . the register circuit is operated by controlling the through state and the latch state of the master side latch circuit and the slave side latch circuit corresponding to the signal state of the clock signal clk . thus , at a leading edge of the clock signal clk , the input data received from the input terminal in is latched to the master side latch circuit and output to the output terminal out through the slave side latch circuit . when the signal level of the clock clk becomes low , the input data is latched by the slave side latch circuit . thus , the output data at the output terminal out does not vary . at this point , since the master side latch circuit becomes the through state , the subsequent input data can be input from the input terminal in . fig3 b is a timing chart showing the above - described operation in the case that the clock signal clk is a low frequency signal . the pulse widths of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 can be given by the following formulas . where tkhkl represents the pulse width on the high side of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 ; tklkh represents the pulse width on the low side of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 ; and tdelay is a time period after the clock signal clk becomes high until the clock signal clk 1 becomes high or a time period after the clock signal clk becomes low until the clock signal clk 2 becomes high . when the clock signal clk is a high frequency signal and the relation of tkhkl & lt ; tdelay or the relation of tklkh & lt ; tdelay is satisfied in the formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), pulses of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 are not generated . fig3 a is a timing chart showing the relation among the clock signal clk ( high frequency signal ), the clock signal clk 1 , and the clock signal clk 2 . in this case , the hold transfer circuits of the latch circuits are kept off state . thus , when the clock signal clk is a high frequency signal , since the time period tdelay is constant , the hold transfer circuits are not operated . in other words , they are as if they were absent . thus , in these circuits , since the number of transistors driven with the clock signal clk is as small as the half of the conventional circuits , the load applied to the clock signal clk decreases and the register circuit operates at high speed . thus , the registers are less skewed . when the clock signal clk is a high frequency signal , since the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 are not generated . thus , the power consumption of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 reduces . in the slave side latch circuit , it is not necessary to turn off the hold transfer circuit . thus , only the circuit that outputs data is operated ( namely , the input transfer circuit is turned on ). consequently , a current fluctuation due to the circuit switching operation does not take place . thus , the time period after the clock signal clk is input until data is released can be shortened . when the clock signal clk is a low frequency signal , the signal level of the connection point pfm of the input transfer circuit ( m 1 and m 2 ) of the master side latch circuit and the signal level of the connection point pfs of the input transfer circuit ( m 5 and m 6 ) of the slave side latch circuit are in floating state . however , after data is latched until a constant time period tdelay elapses , the clock signals ckl 1 and clk 2 are input . thus , the data can be stably latched . the time period tdelay can be designated corresponding to an unstable factor ( such as noise ) of the product . the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 can be easily generated by a logic circuit similar to the generating circuit for the clock signal clk . with a signal of which a leading edge of the clock signal clk is delayed by a delaying circuit , a leading edge of the clock signal clk 1 can be generated . on the other hand , with a signal of which a trailing edge of the clock signal clk is delayed by a delaying circuit , a leading edge of the clock signal clk 2 can be generated . trailing edges of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 can be generated so that they match a leading edge and a trailing edge of the clock signal clk . fig3 c shows the relation among cycle time periods and pulse widths of the clock signals clk , clk 1 , and clk 2 . as shown in fig3 c , the cycle time period ( 1 / f ) is reversely proportional to the frequency . thus , when the clock signal clk is an high frequency signal , the pulse width thereof is narrow . likewise , when the clock signal clk is a high frequency signal , the pulse widths of the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 are narrow . as shown in fig3 c , when the signal level of the clock signal clk frequently varies from high to low , the clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 are not generated . [ second embodiment ] fig4 shows the structure of a second embodiment of the present invention . according to the second embodiment , clocked inverter circuits are used instead of transfer circuits . a clocked inverter circuit composed of a pmos ( m 11 ), a pmos ( m 12 ), an nmos ( m 13 ), and an nmos ( m 14 ) is disposed in series between a power supply and a reference voltage . input data received from an input terminal in is input to the gates of the pmos ( m 11 ) and the nmos ( m 14 ). a clock signal clk is input to the gate of the pmos ( m 12 ). an inverted clock signal clkb of the clock signal clk is input to the nmos ( m 13 ) through an inverter inv 13 . a clock signal clk 1 is input to the gate of an nmos ( m 17 ). an inverted clock signal of the clock signal clk 1 is input to the gate of a pmos ( m 16 ) through an inverter inv 14 . a clock signal clk 2 is input to the gate of an nmos ( m 25 ). an inverted clock signal of the clock signal clk 2 is input to the gate of a pmos ( m 24 ) through an inverter inv 15 . output data of the input transfer circuit ( m 11 to m 14 ) is output to a connection point pm through an inverter inv 11 . output data of the hold transfer circuit ( ml 9 to m 22 ) is input to a connection point pfs . the output data received from the connection point pfs is input to an output terminal out through an inverter inv 12 . a hold transfer circuit ( m 15 to m 18 ) inputs data received from the connection point pm and outputs the data to the connection point pfm . a hold transfer circuit ( m 23 to m 26 ) inputs data received from the output terminal out and outputs the data to the connection point pfs . the operation of the register circuit according to the second embodiment shown in fig4 is theoretically the same as the operation of the register circuit according to the first embodiment shown in fig2 . since the register circuit shown in fig4 transfers and shuts out a signal as an inverter circuit , the register circuit also operates as a buffer circuit . the register circuit according to the second embodiment may operate at high speed depending on the load of a downstream circuit thereof and characteristics of transistors thereof . since the signal level of the connection points of the latch circuits temporarily becomes floating state , when the input data received from the input terminal in varies , the connection points of the latch circuits should be protected from noise . thus , data should be input to the power supply side of the clocked inverter circuit ( pmos and nmos ), whereas a clock signal should be input to the drain output side . the master side circuit and the slave side circuit may be different circuits corresponding to the first embodiment and / or second embodiment . fig5 shows the structure of a third embodiment of the present invention . according to the third embodiment , the stability of the buffer circuit is improved in a floating period after a latch state in which the operation of the buffer circuit is the most unstable in the first embodiment until hold pulses are output . fig5 shows the structure of only a master side latch circuit . however , the structure of the master side latch circuit is the same as the structure of a slave side latch circuit . the size of a pmos ( wp ) of the data input transfer circuit is the same as the size of an nmos ( wn ) thereof . when data is latched , the voltage fluctuates at the floating connection point pfm due to noise . the voltage fluctuation takes place due to the stray capacitance ( cgp ) between the gate and drain of a pmos of a transfer circuit and the stray capacitance ( cgn ) between the gate and drain of an nmos thereof in the case that the clock signal clk is input to the pmos ( wp ) and the nmos ( wn ). normally , a latch circuit is designed so that the size of a pmos is twice as large as the size of an nmos ( the difference of their performances is twice due to the difference of mobilities ). in other words , the difference of the performances of transistors is compensated with the gate width w . thus , the delay time of an inverter logic circuit is prevented from depending on data . however , in a transfer circuit , the output level is raised and lowered by a pmos and an nmos , respectively . thus , the difference of performances corresponding to the types of transistors is not affected by input data . as a result , the latch circuit can be designed so that the gate width w of a pmos is the same as that of an nmos as long as the latch circuit is not affected by input data . when there is a difference of stray capacitance cgd between a pmos and an nmos , the difference should be compensated with the width w . the optimum transistor width is given by the following formula . thus , when data is latched to a latch circuit , noise at the floating connection point is offset by the pmos side and the nmos side . consequently , the voltage fluctuation due to noise does not take place at the connection point . fig6 shows the structure of a fourth embodiment of the present invention . as with the third embodiment , according to the fourth embodiment , when data is latched corresponding to the change of the signal level of a clock signal , noise is prevented from being applied to a floating connection point . fig6 shows the structure of a clocked inverter type latch circuit of a register circuit . to prevent the switching speed of the register from being affected by input data , the register should be designed so that the size of a pmos is twice as large as the size of an nmos . however , in this structure , the pmos side is more affected by noise . thus , when data is latched , the voltage at the connection point pfm floats . to prevent this problem , the size of the pmos to which the clock signal clk is input is reduced . a pull - up nmos to which the clock signal clk is input is disposed in parallel with a pmos to which the clock signal clkb is input . the ideal relation between a pull - down nmos and a pull - up nmos is given by the following formula ( 4 ). where wn 1 is the size of the pull - down nmos ; and wn 2 is the size of the pull - up nmos . thus , when data is latched to the latch circuit , noise applied to the floating connection point is offset by the pmos and the nmos . consequently , the noise does not cause a voltage to fluctuate at the connection point . fig7 shows the structure of a fifth embodiment of the present invention . according to the fifth embodiment , a latch pulse generating portion that generates latch pulses with a predetermined delay equivalent to clock signals clk 1 and clk 2 according to the first embodiment is accomplished by a transient response circuit that dulls the waveform of a signal with a high resistor . as with the first embodiment , input transfer circuits of a master side latch circuit and a slave side latch circuit are turned on and off with a clock signal clk and an inverted clock signal clkb of the clock signal clk . the clock signal clk is inverted as the inverted clock signal clkb by an inverter ( not shown ). a hold transfer circuit of the master side latch circuit is composed of an nmos m 73 and a pmos m 74 connected in parallel . when these mos transistors are turned on , a flip - flop circuit is formed and data is latched . as a gate signal of the nmos m 73 , a clock signal clk 3 is input from an intermediate connection point of registers r 1 and r 2 connected in series between the clock signal clk and a lowest power voltage ( gnd ) as a reference voltage . as a gate signal of the pmos m 74 , a clock signal clk 4 is input from an intermediate connection point of registers r 3 and r 4 connected in series between the inverted clock signal clkb and a maximum power supply voltage ( vdd ). as with the master side hold transfer circuit , the slave side hold transfer circuit is composed of an nmos m 77 and a pmos m 78 . however , as gate input signals , a clock signal clk 5 and a clock signal clk 6 are input . the clock signal clk 5 is input from an intermediate connection point of registers r 5 and r 6 connected between the inverted clock signal clkb and the gnd . the clock signal ckl 6 is input from an intermediate connection point of resistors r 7 and r 8 connected between the clock signal clk and the vdd . the resistance of each of the resistors r 1 to r 8 is on the order of mega - ohms . these resistors may be disposed for each register or in common with a plurality of registers ( in this case , the clock signals clk 3 to clk 6 are in common with one clock signal ). in a low frequency operation of the register , when data is latched to the master side latch circuit , the clock signal clk 3 of the master side latch circuit becomes an intermediate voltage corresponding to the ratio of resistors r 1 and r 2 . thus , the clock signal clk 3 causes the nmos m 73 to be turned on . likewise , the clock signal clk 4 is an intermediate volage corresponding to the ratio of the resistors r 3 and r 4 . thus , the clock signal clk 4 causes the pmos m 74 to be turned on . the operation of the slave side latch circuit is the same as the operation of the master side latch circuit . since the clock signals clk 3 to clk 6 are equivalent to signal loads of high resistors from the view point of the clock signals clk and clkb , the signals clk 3 to clk 6 do not affect the speed of signal changes . in a high frequency operation of the register , since the time constants of the clock signals clk 3 to clk 6 are long , the resistor cannot follow the changes of the signals . thus , the voltages of the clock signals clk 3 and clk 5 lower , whereas the voltages of the clock signals clk 4 and clk 6 rise . consequently , the switching performance of the hold transfer circuits deteriorates . as a result , when a signal frequency exceeds a predetermined frequency , the hold transfer circuits are always turned on . according to the fifth embodiment , when the resister is changed from latch state to through state , the turn off speed of the hold transfer circuits delays . since the gate volage is an intermediate voltage , the performance of the transfer circuits is very low . thus , the reduction of the transfer speed of the signals of the input transfer circuits is slight . however , the reduction does not take place when input data is a high frequency signal . thus , when the register is operated at a high frequency for high speed data output , such a problem does not take place . when high resistors are formed with diffused resistors of a poly - silicon layer , since they can be laid out on another transistor , the area of the register circuit does not increase at all . in addition , it is not necessary to provide a special latch signal ( other than the basis clock signal ) and a generating circuit thereof . thus , the circuit characteristics of the present invention can be accomplished without an increase of the installation area against the conventional circuit . according to the first to fifth embodiments , two staged latch circuits were described . however , when a plurality of stages of latch circuits are tandem - connected , a multi - bit register circuit can be structured . an inverter circuit of each latch circuit is composed of a pmos and an nmos that are tandem - connected between a power supply and a reference voltage . an input digital signal is input to the gates of these transistors . an output signal is obtained from the drains of these transistors as the connection point thereof . thus , both a latch circuit and a register circuit can be integrally fabricated in a mos process . according to the present invention , data received from an input terminal in is input to the source and drain of a pmos m 1 and an nmos m 2 connected in parallel as a transfer circuit . a reference clock signal is input to the gate of the pmos m 1 of the transfer circuit . an output terminal of the transfer circuit is connected to an output driving inverter . an output signal of the output driving inverter is input to a connection point pm . the connection point pm is connected to a latch pass inverter . an output signal of the latch pass inverter is input to a data hold transfer circuit . the output signal of the data hold transfer circuit is input to the output terminal of the input transfer circuit . the input transfer circuit and the data hold transfer circuit compose a latch circuit . a clock signal with a predetermined delay against the reference clock
