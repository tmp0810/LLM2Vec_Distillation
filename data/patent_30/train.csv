"turning now to the drawings , there is shown in fig1 an integrated circuit continuity testing system in which a specimen or circuit configuration 16 is mounted on a fixture 18 operable to vibrate the specimen under controlled conditions , e . g . sinusoidally , randomly , or a combination of the two . the specific structure of the fixture and the means for vibrating it are known in the art and thus not further discussed . the specimen and fixture are housed in a closed chamber 20 whereby the specimen under test can be subjected to temperature cycling , either alone or in conjunction with the vibration testing . an environmental control apparatus , indicated at 22 , is provided for selectively heating or cooling the chamber interior . a cable 24 electrically connects fixture 18 , and thus specimen 16 , with a continuity testing board 26 . it is to be understood that cable 24 includes a multiplicity of separate electrical connections between fixture 18 and testing board 26 , the details of which are discussed in connection with fig6 and 7 . in general , however , continuity testing board 26 includes a plurality of identical sensing circuits , each of which is electrically connected to one of the test circuits of specimen 16 during continuity testing . a power supply 28 biases each of the sensing circuits to a predetermined positive voltage , for example five volts . a pulse generator 30 is provided to control the timing or frequency of samples in the course of testing . a cable 32 connects continuity testing board 26 with a logic analyzer 34 . again , a multiplicity of separate electrical connections are involved , in this case between each of the sensing circuits on continuity testing board 26 and one of many data storage channels in logic analyzer 34 . further electrical connections between logic analyzer 34 and continuity testing board 26 include a plurality of triggering channels provided to initiate storage of data by the logic analyzer upon recognition of an error condition during testing , and a connection for interaction with pulse generator 30 . an indicator 36 also is electrically connected to logic analyzer 34 . panel 36 includes a plurality of light emitting diodes for providing certain indications to a user of the test system . a computer 38 is connected to logic analyzer 34 through a cable connection 40 . computer 38 contains the software which controls logic analyzer 34 in its acquisition and storage of test data and , if desired , can include an associated disc drive or other memory , as indicated at 42 , for the storage of data to supplement the logic analyzer . further peripheral equipment is connected to the computer and used in the course of testing , including a video display terminal 44 for providing the operator with a visual indication of test results on - line , and a printer 46 for generating a permanent record of the test results . fig2 discloses test specimen 16 in greater detail . while the present invention contemplates testing most any configuration involving a multiplicity of individual circuits , the present test system is particularly well adapted for detecting open circuits in an assembly of semiconductor packages mounted to a printed circuit board , such as printed circuit board 48 to which is mounted a plurality of chip carriers 50 . other multiple circuit devices could be tested as well , e . g . flat packs and dual in - line packages ( dip ). it is known as well to mount semiconductor chips directly to a printed circuit board , and it can be appreciated that individual semiconductor chips or chip carriers of a particularly complex design might be tested individually . parallel or simultaneous testing is accomplished by providing multiple , substantially identical sensing circuits on continuity testing board 26 . one such sensing circuit is indicated at 54 in fig3 and includes a differential amplifier 62 and a nand gate 74 available from fairchild as part of a model 9622 receiver . each sensing circuit further includes a high voltage terminal 56 connected to power supply 28 such that it is biased to a predetermined high voltage , e . g . + 5 volts . high voltage terminal 56 is connected to a common terminal or node 58 through an input resistor 60 . node 58 provides a voltage level , in this case a positive voltage of less than 5 , to the positive input terminal of differential amplifier 62 , and also to a terminal 64 connected to the input of the circuit under test . the output voltage of the circuit under test is provided to a terminal 66 of the sensing circuit , whereby the output voltage is provided through a common terminal or node 68 to the inversion input of differential amplifier 62 ( preferably with good common mode rejection ), and also to ground through an output resistor 70 . it should be noted that the terms &# 34 ; input &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; output &# 34 ; for resistors 60 and 70 are used for convenience . these resistors can , as well , be considered as connected to the outputs of the test circuit and providing the inputs to amplifier 62 . in effect , input resistor 60 , output resistor 70 and the arrangement of the circuit under test and differential amplifier 62 in parallel are combined to provide three resistances in series between high voltage terminal 56 and a low voltage terminal 72 , i . e . ground . the sensing of open or unacceptably resistive test circuits is based upon the difference in voltage at the positive and inversion terminals of the differential amplifier . the differential amplifier is a known logic or digital device which generates one of two alternative logic states : a &# 34 ; high &# 34 ; state or higher voltage output whenever the voltage at the positive terminal exceeds the voltage at the inversion terminal by a characteristic or predetermined threshold ; and a low logical output of voltage whenever the voltage at the positive input does not exceed the voltage at the inversion input by the threshold . differential amplifier 62 is selected for its predetermined threshold voltage level , e . g . approximately 1 . 5 volts . an open or unacceptably resistive test circuit is detected as follows . amplifier 62 is a high resistance or impedance device , such that the resistance of its parallel arrangement with the test circuit essentially equals the resistance of the test circuit itself , a nominal or expected resistance of about 2 ohms . input and output resistors 60 and 70 have a substantially greater resistance , for example 100 ohms each . consequently the voltage drop across the test circuit , i . e . across the comparator inputs , is quite small compared to the voltage drop across each of the resistors , for example less than 0 . 1 volts . thus , when the test circuit provides a short or closed path , the drop in voltage between the comparator inputs is much smaller than the 1 . 5 volt threshold and differential amplifier 62 generates the low logic state . conversely , when the test circuit is open the resistance of the parallel arrangement is many times that of resistors 60 and 70 , to the point where the voltage difference between the comparator inputs exceeds the threshold voltage and causes amplifier 62 to generate the high logic state . amplifier 62 also generates the high logic state when the resistance of the circuit being tested is higher than an acceptable maximum corresponding to the predetermined voltage threshold . in particular , given the threshold of 1 . 5 volts in combination with input and output resistors of 100 ohms , and further assuming that the resistance of amplifier 62 is such that the resistance of the above - discussed parallel combination is essentially equal to the resistance of the test circuit , then a resistance in the test circuit of about 70 ohms or greater will cause amplifier 62 to fire . in practice , the actual threshold voltage may vary , for example between 1 . 2 volts and 1 . 8 volts . such deviation , however , does not interfere with the identification of open circuits in any material respect , since the nominal resistance of the circuits is substantially lower than that required to trigger amplifier 62 , while the resistance of an open circuit is of course substantially higher . the output of all sensing circuits 54 is thus a digital word indicating the conditions of the test circuits . amplifier 62 can be provided with a hysteresis ( positive feedback ) loop with a resistance if desired . this would result in cleaner switching output signals , but also would reduce sensitivity . on occasion , it is desirable in the course of testing to configure sensing circuit 54 to provide a logic state indicating normal operation , in spite of the fact that the circuit under test is open or of a high resistance . this option is provided as nand gate 74 receiving the output of differential amplifier 62 , and with another input connected to high voltage terminal 56 through a resistor 76 of a high resistance , e . g . 10 , 000 ohms . a shunt 78 connects resistor 76 to ground through a switch 80 which normally is open . with switch 80 open , a high input is provided to nand gate 74 . a high input to the nand gate from amplifier 62 as well will generate a logic low output from nand gate 74 , indicating an error condition such as an open circuit . of course , for a closed or short circuit the output of differential amplifier 62 is low and the output of nand gate 74 is high , indicating the normal operating condition . if switch 80 is closed , a low logic state is provided as an input to nand gate 74 , resulting in a high or normal condition output regardless of the input received from the differential amplifier . in short , once an error condition is identified for a particular test circuit , switch 80 can be closed to override the error output . in the multiple circuit arrangement , switches 80 are provided in dip form , each package having a row of switches . normally , the sensitivity of sensing circuit 54 to variations in test circuit resistance can be altered by changing the resistances of input and output resistors 60 and 70 , for example increasing sensitivity to generate the error logic state at a lower resistance value by substituting input and output resistors with lower resistance values . an alternative approach is shown in fig4 namely the addition of a resistor 82 between the output of the test circuit and common node 68 . this has the effect of providing a voltage to the inversion input of differential amplifier 62 somewhat lower than the voltage at the output of the associated test circuit , having the practical effect of reducing the voltage threshold between the differential amplifier inputs . as for decreasing the sensitivity of circuit 54 , one approach of course would be to repace resistors 60 and 70 with resistors of a lower resistance value . the voltage at terminal 56 can be changed , or an amplifier with a different threshold can be employed . fig5 and 6 disclose alternative embodiments of the sensing and triggering circuitry on continuity sensing boards such as board 26 . in fig5 the continuity testing board circuitry includes 124 sensing circuits 54 and 124 data channels or signal paths 86 , each connected to an associated one of the sensing circuits for providing the sensing circuit output to a logic analyzer . the sensing circuits are divided into four substantially identical sets of 31 sensing circuits each , one such set being shown . in addition to its data channel , each of the sensing circuits includes a triggering channel 88 . the triggering channels provide the sensing circuit outputs to a series of nand gates 90 , 92 , 94 and 96 , each accepting up to eight triggering channels . when the logic state of all triggering channels to any one of the nand gates is high , which corresponds to the associated test circuits being closed or the associated switches 80 being closed , then the output of the nand will be the low voltage level logic state . should any one of its inputs be low , the output of nand gate 90 ( for example ) is the high logic state . the output of nand gates 90 - 96 is provided to a nor gate 98 , the output of which is provided to a common triggering channel 100 for the first 31 sensing circuits . if all of the inputs to nor gate 98 are the low logic state , the nor gate output is high . conversely , if an error condition is sensed in any of the first 31 test circuits , the corresponding one of nand gates 92 - 96 provides a high level logic state input to the nor gate which in turn generates the low logic state as its output . thus there are four common triggering channels 100 , any one of which sends a triggering signal to the logic analyzer by shifting from the high to the low voltage logic state . fig6 shows alternative continuity sensing board circuitry accommodating 152 separate sensing circuits 54 . again , each sensing circuit 54 has its own associated data channel 102 for providing the sensing circuit output to the logic analyzer . in this case , however , the sensing circuits are segmented into nineteen substantially identical groups of eight for triggering purposes , the first and last of which are shown , such that there are 19 separate common triggering channels 104 . individual triggering channels 106 of eight sensing circuits are provided as inputs to a nand gate 108 , with the output of the nand gate provided directly to the common triggering channel . consequently , if all sensing circuit outputs are the high logic state corresponding to closed circuits or switches 80 , the output of each nand gate 108 is the low logic state . the nand gate of course generates the high voltage logic state should any of its inputs be low , and thus the triggering signal for each of the 19 triggering channels 104 is a shift from the lower logic level to the high logic level . fig7 shows a practical working embodiment in which three test assemblies or specimens , including a 4 inch by 6 inch printed circuit board 110 and two 6 inch by 9 inch printed circuit boards 112 and 114 along with semiconductor packages mounted on each , are tested simultaneously . while this system operates using ttl logic , it should be noted that ecl or cmos logic could be employed as a substitute . pcb 112 is a &# 34 ; single - sided &# 34 ; printed circuit board assembly , while test board 114 is double - sided , having twice the number of test circuits . the printed circuit board assemblies are mounted to respective fixtures 116 , 118 and 120 , with the assemblies and fixtures housed within a test chamber 122 and supported on a vibrational table 124 . a twisted pair cable 126 connects the respective input and output terminals of the test circuits with their associated comparator inputs for each of the sensing circuits of continuity sensing board 128 configured as shown in fig6 . in a similar fashion , twisted pair cables 130 and 132 connect test assemblies 112 and 114 and continuity sensing boards 134 and 136 , which are configured as shown in fig5 . the output of each continuity sensing board , including the data channels and common triggering channels , is provided to a logic analyzer , in particular logic analyzers 138 , 140 and 142 associated with continuity sensing boards 128 , 134 and 136 , respectively . in the arrangement shown , the logic analyzers are model 2100u interactive state analyzers available from northwest instrument systems , inc . of beaverton , oreg . each of the analyzers can receive up to 80 parallel channels of synchronous data , with each channel having a memory of up to 4 , 096 bits . logic analyzers 138 and 140 are connected , and thus together handle the collective input provided by continuity sensing boards 128 and 134 . logic analyzer 142 is associated only with continuity sensing board 136 . ribbon cables 144 and 146 connect a computer 148 to logic analyzers 138 and 140 , while a ribbon cable 150 joins logic analyzer 142 and a computer 152 . computers 148 and 152 in this arrangement can be ibm at personal computers or compatible computers . each of computers 148 and 152 contains the software necessary for operating its associated logic analyzer or analyzers . the software enables each of logic analyzers 138 - 142 to store data only after receiving a storage command or triggering signal from its associated one of the continuity sensing boards . an indicator panel 154 is connected to logic analyzers 138 - 142 respectively through lines 156 , 158 and 160 . indicator panel 154 includes three light emitting diodes ( led &# 39 ; s ) 162 , 164 and 166 triggered responsive to the sensing of error condition logic analyzers 138 , 140 and 142 respectively . a button for resetting the indicator led &# 39 ; s is provided at 167 . a power supply 168 is connected to each of continuity sensing boards 128 , 134 and 136 , and biases the high voltage terminals 56 of the sensing circuits to a positive five volts or other predetermined high voltage level . a grounding terminal of the power supply also is connected to the sensing boards , in particular to the low voltage terminals 72 of the sensing circuits . pulse generators at 170 , 172 and 174 are incorporated into the circuitry of each of the sensing boards to control the rate at which the data channel and common triggering channel outputs are provided to the associated logic analyzers . a sampling frequency of 10 , 000 , 000 pulses per second ( i . e . a 100 nanosecond interval between pulses ) has been found desirable . in the course of using the testing system , the operator first loads each printed circuit board assembly into its appropriate fixture , encloses the loaded fixtures within chamber 122 , and selects the appropriate mode of testing , whether temperature cycling , vibration , or both . the operator then activates the power supply and other components through computers 148 and 152 . at 100 nanosecond intervals , as controlled by pulse generators 170 - 174 , the logic state at each of the sensing circuit outputs and each of the common triggering circuits , is provided to logic analyzers 138 - 142 . however , as long as no open or abnormally highly resistive circuits are indicated , the logic analyzers do not store the data . as soon as any of the circuits is identified as open or highly resistive , the appropriate triggering circuit delivers a changed logic level to its associated logic analyzer , and this change in logic state comprises a storage command or triggering signal , whereupon the logic analyzer begins storing data received in all of its channels . the appropriate one of led &# 39 ; s 162 - 166 is activated to indicate an error condition has been found , and the associated one of computers 148 and 152 displays on its video terminal the error condition . the data stored in the associated logic analyzer can be displayed by the operator if desired . when the memory channels of the logic analyzer are full , no further data can be stored on the logic analyzer . at this point , the operator has the option of utilizing backup storage , for example a disc drive associated with the corresponding computer , and to either continue the test without further adjustment or close the switch 80 associated with the identified circuit and continue testing . override switches 80 thus provide the option of proceeding with the test to locate other open or highly resistant circuits , without a continual loading and unloading of the associated logic analyzer due solely to the particular circuit first indicating an error . of course , if it is desired that the logic analyzer capacity represent a longer period of time , the sampling frequency can be reduced , for example to an interval of one microsecond between pulses . this is accomplished by changing the pulse rate of pulse generators . thus , the test apparatus is capable of identifying not only permanently open circuits , but circuits exhibiting intermittent open behavior under adverse temperature cycling or vibration . the record of the intermittent failure facilitates an analysis of why it occurred , since the permanent record of the failure , on a printout or the like , can be identified with a particular time during the temperature or vibration test cycle . given the simultaneous testing of all channels and the short interval between test pulses , intermittent behavior on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds can be detected . further , the simple and direct connection of the test circuit input and output in parallel with a differential amplifier , and the use of the differential amplifier output to generate one of two logic states as opposed to an analog response , provides a simple , rapid and reliable means for detecting open or highly resistive circuits .",6
"deployment mechanisms that are configured for use with multi - functional surgical instruments that are operable in bipolar and / or monopolar modes of operation may prove useful in the surgical arena , and such deployment mechanisms are described herein . specifically , the deployment mechanisms described herein include one or more linkage configurations that , when actuated , move a monopolar electrode of the electrosurgical forceps from a retracted configuration to a deployed configuration to electrosurgically treat tissue . fig1 - 4 illustrate a forceps 10 that includes a deployment mechanism 28 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure . the forceps 10 is configured to operate in both a bipolar mode , e . g ., for grasping , treating , coagulating and / or sealing tissue , and a monopolar mode , e . g ., for treating and / or dissecting tissue , although other configurations are also contemplated . briefly , the forceps 10 includes an outer fixed shaft 12 defining a longitudinal axis “ a - a ,” a housing 14 , a handle assembly 16 , a trigger assembly 18 ( only shown in fig1 ), a rotating assembly 20 , an end effector assembly 22 , and a monopolar assembly that includes an outer sleeve 24 and an energizable rod member 26 ( the energizable rod 26 is shown in fig5 b ). for a more detailed description of the forceps 10 and operative components associated therewith , reference is made to commonly - owned u . s . patent application ser . no . 14 / 047 , 474 . the deployment mechanism 28 includes a lever 30 that is positioned within the housing 14 ( fig2 and 3 ). the lever 30 includes a thumb paddle 32 that is operable by a user from left and / or right exterior side surfaces 14 a , 14 b , respectively , of the housing 14 . in the illustrated embodiment , the thumb paddle 32 is disposed within opposing recesses 34 ( fig1 and 4 ) defined on the left and right exterior side surfaces 14 a , 14 b of the housing 14 . the thumb paddle 32 may be positioned on only one of the left or right sides side surfaces 14 a , 14 b of the housing 14 . the thumb paddle 32 is movable within the recesses 34 relative to the housing 14 from a first configuration ( fig2 ) to second configuration ( fig1 , 3 , and 4 ). in fig1 , the paddle 32 is shown between the first and second configurations . referring to fig2 and 3 , a bottom portion 36 of the lever 30 is pivotably coupled to a proximal end 38 of the fixed outer shaft 12 adjacent a spring cartridge 40 of a drive assembly 42 of the forceps 10 . the bottom portion 36 pivots about the outer fixed shaft 12 when the lever 30 is moved between the first and second configurations . an upper portion 44 of the lever 30 pivotably couples to a linkage 46 via one or more suitable coupling methods , e . g . a pin , rivet or the like ( not explicitly shown ). continuing with reference to fig2 and 3 , the linkage 46 includes a first link member 46 a and a second link member 46 b . a proximal end 48 of the first link member 46 a pivotably couples to the upper portion 44 of the lever 30 via one of the aforementioned coupling members ( e . g ., a pin , rivet , or the like .). a distal end 50 of the first link member 46 a couples to a proximal end 52 of the second link member 46 b via a pivot 54 ( e . g ., a pivot pin 54 ). the pivot pin 54 is slidably disposed within an elongated slot 56 defined in an interior wall 58 of the housing 14 ( as best seen in fig3 ). the elongated slot 56 has a slight curvature adjacent its distal end and extends distally into a tapered distal end of the housing 14 . in the embodiment illustrated in fig1 - 4 , the first link member 46 a also includes a slight curvature adjacent its distal end , which facilitates sliding the first link member 46 a within the elongated slot 56 . when the thumb paddle 32 of the lever 30 is moved from the first configuration to the second configuration , the pivot pin 54 is slid into position at a distal end of the elongated slot 56 ( fig3 ) which allows the proximal end 52 of the second link member 46 b to pivot about the pivot pin 54 and move a distal end 60 of the second link member 46 b distally . the distal end 60 of the second link member 46 b couples to a collar 62 via a pivot pin 64 . the collar 62 is operably coupled to a proximal end 66 of the outer insulative sleeve 24 of the monopolar assembly of the forceps 10 . when the proximal end 52 of the second link member 46 b pivots about the pivot pin 54 , the distal end 60 of the second link member 46 b moves distally , which , in turn , moves the collar 62 and the outer insulative sleeve 24 distally thereby covering a pair of jaw members 21 , 23 of the end effector assembly 22 , as will be described in detail below . the outer insulative sleeve 24 is slidably disposed about outer fixed shaft 12 and is configured for translation about and relative to the outer fixed shaft 12 between a fully retracted configuration ( fig2 and 5a ) and a fully deployed configuration ( fig3 , 4 , and 5 b ). in the retracted configuration , the outer insulative sleeve 24 is disposed proximal of the end effector assembly 22 , and in the deployed configuration , the outer insulative sleeve 24 is disposed about the end effector assembly 22 to substantially cover the jaw members 21 , 23 . referring to fig5 a and 5b , the energizable rod member 26 is coupled to the outer insulative sleeve 24 such that advancement of the outer insulative sleeve 24 between the retracted and deployed configurations and advancement of energizable rod member 26 between the retracted and deployed configurations are effected concurrently or near concurrently , via actuation of the lever 30 . energizable rod member 26 is coupled to a source of energy for providing energy to a distal tip 25 of the energizable rod member 26 , e . g ., upon actuation of an activation switch 68 ( fig1 - 4 ) in a monopolar mode of operation , for treating tissue using monopolar energy . as discussed above , the forceps 10 is operable in both the bipolar mode , e . g ., for grasping , treating , coagulating , sealing and / or cutting tissue , and the monopolar mode , e . g ., for electrosurgical tissue treatment . in use , with respect to either mode of operation , initially , forceps 10 is manipulated such that end effector assembly 22 is positioned and oriented as desired within a surgical site . in the bipolar mode , the outer insulative sleeve 24 and energizable rod member 26 of the monopolar assembly remain disposed in the retracted configuration , as shown in fig2 and 5a . with the jaw members 21 , 23 of the end effector assembly 22 disposed in the spaced - apart configuration , the end effector assembly 22 may be maneuvered into position such that tissue to be grasped and treated is disposed between jaw members 21 , 23 . next , the movable handle 17 ( fig1 ) of the handle assembly 16 is actuated , or pulled proximally relative to a fixed handle 15 ( fig1 ) such that jaw member 21 is pivoted relative to jaw member 23 from the spaced - apart configuration to the approximated configuration to grasp tissue therebetween , as shown in fig5 a . in this approximated configuration , energy may be selectively supplied , e . g ., via activation switch 68 , to tissue - sealing plates ( not explicitly shown ) of the jaw members 21 , 23 and conducted through tissue to effect a tissue seal or otherwise treat tissue . with respect to the monopolar mode of operation , the movable handle 17 is first depressed relative to fixed handle 15 to pivot jaw member 21 relative to jaw member 23 from the spaced - apart configuration to the approximated configuration . once jaw members 21 , 23 are disposed in the approximated configuration , the thumb paddle 32 of the lever 30 is moved from the first configuration to the second configuration , thereby urging the first and second link members 46 a , 46 b distally . distal translation of the first and second link members 46 a , 46 b , in turn , translates the collar 36 distally through the housing 14 . distal translation of the collar 36 moves the outer insulative sleeve 24 of the monopolar assembly distally over the end effector assembly 22 and moves the energizable rod member 26 distally such that the distal tip 25 of energizable rod member 26 extends distally from both the end effector assembly 22 and the outer insulative sleeve 24 ( fig5 b ). with the distal tip 25 of the energizable rod 26 disposed in the deployed configuration , the activation switch 68 of the forceps 10 may be selectively actuated to supply energy to the distal tip 25 of energizable rod member 26 for electrosurgically treating tissue . the distal tip 25 may also be used in a mechanical fashion depending upon the shape of the distal tip 25 . the deployment mechanism 28 described herein for use with the forceps 10 is easy to operate and inexpensive to manufacture when compared to the aforementioned conventional deployment mechanisms , as the deployment mechanism 28 is not interconnected with the handle assembly 16 , rotation assembly 20 and / or the trigger assembly 18 of the forceps 10 . from the foregoing and with reference to the various figure drawings , those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain modifications can also be made to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the same . for example , other linkage configurations may be used to move the outer sleeve 24 including the energizable rod 26 between the retracted and deployed configurations . referring now to fig6 -

"now , first and second embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings . in the following description of the drawings in the first and second embodiment , identical or similar constituents are designated by identical or similar reference numerals . fig1 is a view showing a wireless transceiver device according to a first embodiment of the present invention . as shown in fig1 , this embodiment includes a data processor 1 , a data transceiver 2 , a rf ( radio frequency ) unit 3 , and an antenna 4 . the data transceiver 2 includes a transmitter 5 and a receiver 6 . the data processor 1 is connected to the transceiver 2 . the data transceiver 2 is connected to the rf unit 3 . the rf unit 3 is connected to the antenna 4 . the data processor 1 is a circuit for processing digital format data , such as a digital processor or a dedicated communication chip . the transmitter 5 of the transceiver 2 is a circuit for converting digital format data inputted from the data processor 1 into data with a format suitable for wireless communication and outputting the data to the rf unit 3 as a transmission signal . meanwhile , the receiver 6 of the transceiver 2 is a circuit for converting received data inputted from the rf unit 3 into digital format data and outputting the data to the digital processor 1 . the transmitter 5 and the receiver 6 will be described later in detail . the rf unit 3 is a circuit for processing a carrier wave for wireless communication . this is the circuit for superposing the transmission signal inputted from the transmitter 5 on the carrier wave and outputting the signal to the antenna 4 , for example . meanwhile , this is the circuit for removing a carrier wave component from data received from the antenna 4 and outputting the data to the receiver 6 , for example . next , the transmitter 5 will be described with reference to fig2 . fig2 is a block diagram showing a configuration of the transmitter 5 . as shown in fig2 , the transmitter 5 includes a serial - parallel converter 10 , an encoder 11 , code selectors 12 , spreaders 13 , and an inverse fast fourier transformer 14 . the serial - parallel converter 10 is connected to the data processor 1 , the encoder 11 , and the spreaders 13 . when this first embodiment is applied to the bpsk modulation , the serial - parallel converter 10 rearranges binary information bit series data with a serial format and outputs the data as parallel format data . the binary information bit series are one - bit code series such as a sequence consisting of 0 and 1 . first , in this embodiment , binary information bit series data having a predetermined number of bits equal to n are inputted from the data processor 1 to the serial - parallel converter 10 . certainly this method is varying with modulation method ( qpsk , for example ), vary with modulation method . this n is a value calculated by n = k *( q + 1 )+( n − k ). the k is a number of blocks of bit series i to be described later . the q is a number of bits contained in each block in the bit series i . the n corresponds to n of ( n , k ) rs codes to be described later . moreover , the number of orthogonal codes is determined in response to the q value . for example , when n = 16 bit , q = 3 and n = 7 , code selector number k is decided as 3 . it is because that there are code selectors need for parity symbol . on the other hand , in current system , n is equal to k *( q + 1 ). so , when q = 3 , code selector number is 3 . when q = 4 , code selector number is 4 as well . next , the parallel format data will be described . the serial - parallel converter 10 divides the inputted n bits of data into n sets of beat groups a ( a = a 0 to a n - 1 ) and the bit series i which are equivalent to the remaining bits after subtracting the n sets of beat groups from the n and outputs the data . each of the beat groups ranging from a 0 to a n - 1 has one bit . accordingly , the bit series i have ( n - n ) bits . meanwhile , the beat groups ranging from a 0 to a n - 1 are outputted to the spreaders 13 . the bit series i are outputted to the encoder 11 . the bit series i are divided into a predetermined number of blocks equal to k . moreover , each block has a predetermined number of bits equal to q . meanwhile each single bit in the bit series i is indicated by i s , t . here , the s indicates the block and the t indicates a bit number in the block . the s is any of the numbers ranging from 0 to k − 1 . the t is any of the numbers ranging from 0 to q − 1 . the encoder 11 executes error correction coding on the bit series i outputted from the serial - parallel converter 10 and outputs the data to the code selectors 12 as parity series b ( b = b 0 to b n - 1 ). in this embodiment , rs ( reed - solomon ) coding on ( n = 2 q , k ) configured to perform correction on the symbol basis is applied to error correction coding . here , the symbol refers to a cluster of a predetermined number of bits . the n represents the number of symbols to be transmitted while the k represents the number of information symbols out of the symbols to be transmitted . in this case , the maximum error correction number e of ( n , k ) rs codes satisfies e =( n − k )/ 2 . that is , it is possible to correct symbols errors up to e pieces . there are n pieces of the code selectors 12 in total and any one of b 0 to b n - 1 out of the n pieces of the parity series b outputted from the encoder 11 is inputted to each of the code selectors 12 . each of the code selectors 12 selects an orthogonal code corresponding to the value of the parity series b and outputs the code as an orthogonal code c ( c = c 0 to c n - 1 ) corresponding to any one of b 0 to b n - 1 . here , the orthogonal codes are numbers uniquely determined in response to inputs of the bits , which are binary information bit series having the number of bits equal to 2 q prepared in advance in this embodiment . any one of the orthogonal codes c ( c = c 0 to c n - 1 ) and any one of the beat groups ( a = a 0 to a n - 1 ) are inputted to and diffused in each of the spreaders 13 , and the data are outputted as diffused data x ( x = x 0 to x n - 1 ). the diffused data x are modulated by using any one of frequencies out of n sub pieces of sub - carriers and are then outputted . all the diffused data x ranging from x 0 to xn - 1 are inputted from n pieces of the spreaders 13 to the inverse fast fourier transformer 14 , and the inverse fast fourier transformer 14 executes inverse fast fourier transform and outputs a single transmission signal to the rf unit . as described above , the transmitter 5 firstly divides the n bits of the binary information series data into the beat groups a ( a = a 0 to a n - 1 ) and the bit series i ( i = i 0 , 0 to i k - 1 , q - 1 ). next , the transmitter 5 executes error correction coding on the bit series i and outputs the parity bit series b ( b = b 0 to b n - 1 ). then , one of 2 q pieces of the orthogonal codes is selected for the parity bit series b and is outputted as the orthogonal code c ( c = c 0 to c n - 1 ). next , the orthogonal code c and the beat groups a are diffused and outputted as the diffused data x ( x = x 0 to x n - 1 ). then , the diffused data x are subjected to inverse fast fourier transform and the transmission signal is outputted . above mentioned embodiment is applied for multi - carrier system ( for example , ofdm ), furthermore , it is also possible to be applied for multi - code system . in multi - code system , inverse fast fourier transformer 14 becomes summation , and fast fourier transformer 20 becomes serial to parallel converter . next , the receiver 6 will be described with reference to fig3 and fig4 . fig3 is a block diagram showing a configuration of the receiver 6 . fig4 is a block diagram showing a configuration of a correlator 21 . as shown in fig3 , the receiver 6 includes a fast fourier transformer 20 , correlators 21 , a decoder 22 , and a parallel - serial converter 23 . as shown in fig4 , the correlator 21 further includes sub - correlators 25 and a data converter 26 . the fast fourier transformer 20 is connected to the rf unit 3 and the correlators 21 . the fast fourier transformer 20 executes fast fourier transform on received data , outputted from the rf unit 3 and outputs n pieces of data x ( x = x 0 to x n - 1 ) to the correlators 21 . the correlators 21 are connected to the fast fourier transformer 20 , the decoder 22 , and the parallel - serial converter 23 . first , one of the data x outputted from the fast fourier transformer 20 is inputted to each of the correlators 21 . the correlator 21 executes inverse diffusion and outputs a soft decision series b ( b = b 0 , 0 to b n - 1 , q - 1 ), which is the most likely bit series used for code selection at the time of transmission , to the decoder 22 . this inverse diffusion is to output the bit series from the orthogonal code on the contrary to the above - described code selector 12 . procedures of this inverse diffusion are as follows . first , all correlations between the inputted data x and the orthogonal codes are calculated . then , the bit series is outputted as the soft decision series b by use of the orthogonal bit having the highest correlation . next , the correlator 21 restore a decoded beat group a ( a = a 0 to a n - 1 ) by use of one of the data x and a correction parity series e ( e = e 0 , 0 to e n - 1 , q - 1 ), and outputs the data to the parallel - serial converter 23 . this correction parity series e will be described later in detail . the decoder 22 is connected to the correlators 21 and the parallel - serial converter 23 . the decoder 22 executes decoding on error correction codes by use of the soft decision series b outputted from the correlators 21 and outputs decoded bit series i ( i = i 0 , 0 to i n - 1 , q - 1 ) and the correction parity series e ( e = e 0 , 0 to e n - 1 , q - 1 ). the decoded bit series i are outputted to the parallel - serial converter 23 . meanwhile , the correction parity series e are recursively outputted to the correlators 21 . the correction parity series e ( e = e 0 , 0 to e n - 1 , q - 1 ) are values obtained by subjecting the decoded bit series i to rs coding . specifically , though the soft decision series b may contain errors , such errors are corrected in the correction parity series e and the correction parity series e are likely to be more accurate values than the soft decision series b . therefore , when restoring the decoded beat groups a , it is possible to improve a probability of restoring more accurate values by using the correction parity series e instead of using the soft decision series b . the decoded bit series i outputted from the decoder 22 and the decoded beat groups a outputted from the correlators 21 are inputted to the parallel - serial converter 23 in parallel . the data are outputted to the data processor 1 as serial data and the binary information bit series are restored therefrom . as described above , the receiver 6 executes fast fourier transform on the received signal and divides the signal into n pieces of the data x ( x = x 0 to x n - 1 ). then , the receiver 6 executes inverse diffusion on the data x and outputs the soft decision series b ( b = b 0 , 0 to b n - 1 , q - 1 ) used for code selection . next , the receiver 6 subjects the soft decision series b to decoding of the error correction signals and outputs the decoded bit series i ( i = i 0 , 0 to i n - 1 , q - 1 ) and the correction parity series e ( e = e 0 , 0 to e n - 1 , q - 1 ). then , the receiver 6 outputs the decoded beat groups a by utilizing the correlations between the recursively - used correction parity series e and the data x . next , the receiver 6 restores the binary information bit series by use of the decoded bit series i and the decoded beat groups a . in this embodiment , the encoder 11 carries out error correction coding before code selection by the code selectors 12 at the time of transmission . accordingly , it is possible to correct errors of code selection at the time of reception and thereto achieve accurate reception . for example , even when an error of a transmission signal may occur due to a characteristic of a communication path in wireless communication , it is possible to correct such an error at the time of reception . meanwhile , when transmitted data have a large number of bits , code selection errors at the time of reception may lead to errors of received data . however , this embodiment can correct such errors as well . moreover , this embodiment is configured to use the beat groups and is able to reduce the papr as compared to a configuration not using the beat groups . to be more precise , assuming that input data consist of 16 bits and that the number of sub - carriers is equal to the papr , the papr is equal to 16 in a typical multi - carrier system ( ofdm ). in this embodiment , since there are seven cs blocks , the papr is 7 . thus , the papr is reduced from 16 to 7 . meanwhile , in comparison with the conventional cs / cdma method having four cs blocks , the papr becomes equal to 4 in the conventional cs / cdma method . although the papr is slightly increased in comparison with the conventional cs / cdma method , this embodiment has an effect to improve a ber ( bit error rate ). as described above , this embodiment can improve the ber while moderating the increase in the papr . next , a concrete example of the first embodiment will be described with reference to fig5 and fig6 . fig5 shows a configuration of the transmitter 5 in the case where the encoder 11 applies ( 7 , 3 ) rs coding . fig6 shows a configuration of the receiver 6 corresponding to the transmitter in fig5 . as shown in fig5 , the number of sub -

1 ) to the erasure encoder 40 . the correlation coefficients 6 are binary information bit series having the number of bits equal to 2 n . the erasure encoder 40 determines a certain threshold and specifies erased positions according to the correlation coefficients δ , and then outputs erased portions ε ( ε = ε 0 , 0 to ε n - 1 , q - 1 ). here , the erased positions are determined after a continuous process of trial and error . note that a relation ε = r − q is satisfied herein . the decoder 22 specifies positions ; which are to be corrected , according to the erased portions outputted from the erasure encoder 40 and decodes the soft decision series b . in this embodiment , the erasure encoder 40 is added to the configuration of the first embodiment . in rs coding , the correctable number of erased symbols exceeds that of erroneous symbols . consequently , in this embodiment , the correctable number symbols are increased as compared to the first embodiment . accordingly , it is possible to reduce code selection errors more efficiently than the first embodiment even when using the same rs codes as those in the first embodiment . fig8 is a view showing an embodiment which employs ( 7 , 3 ) rs erasure decoding to the embodiment shown in fig7 . this example is similar to the concrete example of the first embodiment except addition of the erasure encoder 40 , and duplicate explanation will therefore be omitted . the correlators 21 output the correlation coefficients δ ( δ = δ 0 to δ 0 to the erasure encoder 40 . the erasure encoder 40 outputs the erased portion ε 0 =( ε 0 , 0 , ε 0 , 1 , ε 0 , 2 ) according to the correlation coefficient ε 0 . similarly , ε 1 =( ε 1 , 0 , ε 1 , 1 , ε 1 , 2 ) is outputted for the correlation coefficient δ 1 , ε 2 =( ε 2 , 0 , ε 2 , 1 , ε 2 , 2 ) is outputted for the correlation coefficient δ 2 , ε 3 =( ε 3 , 0 , ε 3 , 1 , ε 3 , 2 ) is outputted for the correlation coefficient δ 3 , ε 4 =( ε 4 , 0 , ε 4 , 1 , ε 4 , 2 ) is outputted for the correlation coefficient δ 4 , ε 5 =( ε 5 , 0 , ε 5 , 1 , ε 5 , 2 ) is outputted for the correlation coefficient δ 5 , and ε 6 =( ε 6 , 0 , ε 6 , 1 , ε 6 , 2 ) is outputted for the correlation coefficient δ 6 . although this embodiment has been described by use of concrete numbers , other numbers are also applicable thereto . although the above - described embodiments apply rs coding to the encoder 11 , it is also possible to employ other error correction coding methods . although the embodiments employ inverse fast fourier transform and fast fourier transform , it is also possible to employ other applications . the present invention has been described with reference to the first and second embodiments . however , the description and the drawings constituting part of this disclosure will not limit the scope of this invention . it is obvious to those skilled in the art that various other embodiments , examples , and technical applications are possible from the teachings of this disclosure . accordingly , it is to be understood that the present invention encompasses various other embodiments which are not expressly stated herein . in this context , the present invention shall be solely determined by the matter to define the invention relevant to the appended claims that deem to be appropriate in conjunction with this disclosure .",7
"as used herein , “ administration ” of a composition includes any route of administration , including oral subcutaneous , intraperitoneal , and intramuscular . as used herein , “ an effective amount ” is an amount sufficient to reduce one or more symptoms associated with a stroke . as used herein , “ protein kinase c activator ” or “ pkc activator ” means a substance that increases the rate of the reaction catalyzed by protein kinase c by binding to the protein kinase c . as used herein , the term “ pharmaceutically acceptable carrier ” means a chemical composition with which the active ingredient may be combined and which , following the combination , can be used to administer the active ingredient to a subject . as used herein , the term “ physiologically acceptable ” ester or salt means an ester or salt form of the active ingredient which is compatible with any other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition , which is not deleterious to the subject to which the composition is to be administered . as used herein , “ pharmaceutically acceptable carrier ” also includes , but is not limited to , one or more of the following : excipients ; surface active agents ; dispersing agents ; inert diluents ; granulating and disintegrating agents ; binding agents ; lubricating agents ; sweetening agents ; flavoring agents ; coloring agents ; preservatives ; physiologically degradable compositions such as gelatin ; aqueous vehicles and solvents ; oily vehicles and solvents ; suspending agents ; dispersing or wetting agents ; emulsifying agents , demulcents ; buffers ; salts ; thickening agents ; fillers ; emulsifying agents ; antioxidants ; antibiotics ; antifungal agents ; stabilizing agents ; and pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric or hydrophobic materials . other “ additional ingredients ” which may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are known in the art and described , for example in genaro , ed ., 1985 , remington &# 39 ; s pharmaceutical sciences , mack publishing co ., easton , pa ., which is incorporated herein by reference . the formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology . in general , such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with a carrier or one or more other accessory ingredients , and then , if necessary or desirable , shaping or packaging the product into a desired single - or multi - dose unit . although the descriptions of pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for ethical administration to humans , it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions are generally suitable for administration to animals of all sorts . modification of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well understood , and the ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and perform such modification with merely ordinary , if any , experimentation . subjects to which administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is contemplated include , but are not limited to , humans and other primates , and other mammals . despite progress toward the development of new therapeutic agents and availability of several animal models , there is still a pressing need for improved animal models for screening the pkc gene family consists presently of 11 genes which are divided into four subgroups : i ) classical pkcα , β 1 , β 2 ( β 1 and β 2 are alternatively spliced forms of the same gene ) and γ , 2 ) novel pkcδ , ε , η , and θ , 3 ) atypical pkcζ , λ , η and i and 4 ) pkc μ . pkc μ resembles the novel pkc isoforms but differs by having a putative transmembrane domain ( reviewed by blohe et al . ( 1994 ) cancer metast . rev . 13 : 411 ; ilug et al . ( 1993 ) biochem j . 291 : 329 ; kikkawa et al . ( 1989 ) ann . rev . biochem . 58 : 31 ). the α , β 1 , β 2 and γ isoforms are c 2 + , phospholipid and diacylglycerol - dependent and represent the classical isoforms of pkc , whereas the other isoforms are activated by phospholipid and diacylglycerol but are not dependent on ca 2 + . all isoforms encompass 5 variable ( v1 - v5 ) regions , and the α , β and γ isoforms contain four ( c1 - c4 ) structural domains which are highly conserved . all isoforms except pkc α , β and γ lack the c2 domain , the λ η and isoforms also lack nine of two cysteine - rich zinc finger domains in ci to which diacylglycerol binds . the cl domain also contains the pseudosubstrate sequence which is highly conserved among all isoforms , and which serves an autoregulartory function by blocking the substrate - binding site to produce an inactive conformation of the enzyme ( house et al . ( 1987 ) science 238 , 1726 ). 100271 because of these structural features , diverse pkc isoforms are thought to have highly specialized roles in signal transduction in response to physiological stimuli ( nishizuka ( 1989 ) cancer 10 : 1892 ), as well as in neoplastic transformation and differentiation ( glazer ( 1994 ) protein kinase c , j . f . kuo , ed ., oxford u . press at pages 171 - 198 ). for a discussion of known pkc modulators see pct / us97 / 08141 , u . s . pat . nos . 5 , 652 , 232 ; 6 , 080 , 784 ; 5 , 891 , 906 ; 5 , 962 , 498 ; 5 , 955 , 501 ; 5 , 891 , 870 and 5 , 962 , 504 ( each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ). there is increasing evidence that the individual pkc isozymes play significant roles in biological processes which provide the basis for pharmacological exploitation . one is the design of specific ( preferably , isozyme specific ) activators of pkc . this approach is complicated by the fact that the catalytic domain is not the domain primarily responsible for the isozyme specificity of pkc . these may provide a way to override the effect of other signal transduction pathways with opposite biological effects . alternatively , by inducing down - regulation of pkc after acute activation , pkc activators may cause long term antagonism . bryostatin is currently in clinical trials as an anti - cancer agent . the bryostatins are known to bind to the regulatory domain of pkc and to activate the enzyme . bryostatins are examples of isozyme - selective activators of pkc . ( see for example wo 97 / 43268 ; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ). for a discussion of known pkc modulators see pct / us97 / 08141 , u . s . pat . nos . 5 , 652 , 232 ; 6 , 043 , 270 ; 6 , 080 , 784 ; 5 , 891 , 906 ; 5 , 962 , 498 ; 5 , 955 , 501 ; 5 , 891 , 870 and 5 , 962 , 504 ( each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ). several classes of pkc activators have been identified . phorbol esters , however , are not suitable compounds for eventual drug development because of their tumor promotion activity , ( ibarreta et al . ( 1999 ) neuro report 10 ( 5 & amp ; 6 ): 1035 - 40 ). of particular interest are macrocyclic lactones ( i . e . bryostatin class and neristatin class ) that act to stimulate pkc . of the bryostatin class compounds ., bryostatin - 1 has been shown to activate pkc and proven to be devoid of tumor promotion activity . bryostatin - 1 , as a pkc activator , is also particularly useful since the dose response curve of bryostatin - 1 is biphasic . additionally , bryostatin - 1 demonstrates differential regulation of pkc isozymes , including pkcα , pkcδ and pkcε . bryostatin - 1 has undergone toxicity and safety studies in animals and humans and is actively investigated as an anti - cancer agent . bryostatin - 1 &# 39 ; s use in the studies has determined that the main adverse reaction in humans is myalgia . one example of an effective dose is 40 μg / m 2 per week by intravenous injection . macrocyclic lactones , and particularly bryostatin - 1 is described in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 560 , 774 ( incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ). macrocyclic lactones and their derivatives are described elsewhere in u . s . pat . no . 6 , 187 , 568 , u . s . pat . no . 6 , 043 , 270 , u . s . pat . no . 5 , 393 , 897 , u . s . pat . no . 5 , 072 , 004 , u . s . pat . no . 5 , 196 , 447 , u . s . pat . no . 4 , 833 , 257 , and u . s . pat . no . 4 , 611 , 066 ( incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ). the above patents describe various compounds and various uses for macrocyclic lactones including their use as an anti - inflammatory or anti - tumor agent . ( szallasi et al . ( 1994 ) journal of biological chemistry 269 ( 3 ): 2118 - 24 ; zhang et al . ( 1996 ) caner research 56 : 802 - 808 ; hennings et al .

( 2000 ) clinical cancer research 6 : 825 - 828 ; mutter et at ( 2000 ) bioorganic & amp ; medicinal chemistry 8 : 1841 - 1860 )( each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ). as will also be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art , macrocyclic lactone compounds and their derivatives , particularly the bryostatin class , are amenable to combinatorial synthetic techniques and thus libraries of the compounds can be generated to optimize pharmacological parameters , including , but not limited to efficacy and safety of the compositions . additionally , these libraries can be assayed to determine those members that preferably modulate α - secretase and / or pkc . combinatorial libraries high throughput screening of natural products and fermentation broths has resulted in the discovery of several new drugs . at present , generation and screening of chemical diversity is being utilized extensively as a major technique for the discovery of lead compounds , and this is certainly a major fundamental advance in the area of drug discovery . additionally , even after a “ lead ” compound has been identified , combinatorial techniques provide for a valuable tool for the optimization of desired biological activity . as will be appreciated , the subject reaction readily lend themselves to the creation of combinatorial libraries of compounds for the screening of pharmaceutical , or other biological or medically - related activity or material - related qualities . a combinatorial library for the purposes of the present invention is a mixture of chemically related compounds , which may be screened together for a desired property ; said libraries may be in solution or covalently linked to a solid support . the preparation of many related compounds in a single reaction greatly reduces and simplifies the number of screening processes that need to be carried out . screening for the appropriate biological property may be done by conventional methods . thus , the present invention also provides methods for determining the ability of one or more inventive compounds to bind to effectively modulate α - secretase and / or pkc . a variety of techniques are available in the art for generating combinatorial libraries described below , but it will be understood that the present invention is not intended to be limited by the foregoing examples and descriptions . ( see , for example , blondelle et al . ( 1995 ) trends anal . chem . 14 : 83 ; u . s . pat . nos . 5 , 359 , 115 ; 5 , 362 , 899 ; u . s . pat . no . 5 , 288 , 514 : pct publication wo 94 / 08051 ; chen et al .

( 2004 ) curr drug discov technol . 1 : 1 ; wender et al . ( 1998 ) proc natl acad sci usa 95 : 6624 ; wender et al . ( 2002 ) am chem soc . 124 : 13648 ( each incorporated herein by reference in their entireties )) possesses the highest affinity for pkc . this bryolog is about100 times more potent than bryostatin - 1 . only analog 1 exhibits a higher affinity for pkc than bryostatin . analog 2 , which lacks the a ring of bryostatin - 1 is the simplest analog that maintains high affinity for pkc . in addition to the active bryologs , analog 7d , which is acetylated at position 26 , hasvirtually no affinity for pkc . b - ring bryologs are also suitable for use in the methods of the present invention . these synthetic bryologs have affinities in the low nanomolar range ( wender et al . ( 2006 ) org lett . 8 : 5299 ( incorporated herein by reference in its entirety )). the b - ring bryologs have the advantage of being completely synthetic , and do not require purification from a natural source . a third class of suitable bryostatin analogs is the a - ring bryologs . these bryologs have slightly lower affinity for pkc than bryostatin 1 ( 6 . 5 , 2 . 3 , and 1 . 9 nm for bryologs 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively ) but have a lower molecular weight . a number of derivatives of diacylglycerol ( dag ) bind to and activate protein kinase c ( niedel et al . ( 1983 ) proc . natl . acad . sci . usa 80 : 36 ; mori et al . ( 1982 ) j . biochem ( tokyo ) 91 : 427 ; kaibuchi et al . ( 1983 ) j . biol . chem . 258 : 6701 ). however , dag and dag derivatives are of limited value as drugs . activation of pkc by diacylglycerols is transient , because they are rapidly metabolized by diacylglycerol kinase and lipase ( bishop et al . ( 1986 ) j . biol . chem . 261 : 6993 ; chung et al . ( 1993 ) am . j . physiol . 265 : c927 ; incorporated herein by reference in their entireties ). the fatty acid substitution determines the strength of activation . diacylglycerols having an unsaturated fatty acid are most active . the stereoisomeric configuration is also critical . fatty acids with a 1 , 2 - sn configuration are active , while 2 , 3 - sn - diacylglycerols and 1 , 3 - diacylglycerols do not bind to pkc . cis - unsaturated fatty acids are synergistic with diacylglycerols . in one embodiment of the present invention , the term “ pkc activator ” expressly excludes dag or dag derivatives , such as phorbol esters . isoprenoids are pkc activators suitable for use in the methods of the present invention . farnesyl thiotriazole , for example , is a synthetic isoprenoid that activates pkc with a kd of 2 . 5 μm . farnesyl thiotriazole , for example , is equipotent with dioleoylglycerol ( gilbert et al . ( 1995 ) biochemistry 34 : 3916 ; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety ), but does not possess hydrolyzable esters of fatty acids . farnesyl thiotriazole and related compounds represent a stable , persistent pkc activator . because of its low mw ( 305 . 5 ) and absence of charged groups , farnesyl thiotriazole would readily cross the blood - brain barrier . octylindolactam v is a non - phorbol protein kinase c activator related to teleocidin . the advantages of octylindolactam v , specifically the (-)- enantiomer , include greater metabolic stability , high potency ( fujiki et al . ( 1987 ) adv . cancer res . 49 : 223 ; collins et al . ( 1982 ) biochem . biophys . res . commun . 104 : 1159 ; each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety )( ec50 = 29 nm ) and low molecular weight that facilitates transport across the blood brain barrier . gnidimacrin is a daphnane - type diterpene that displays potent antitumor activity at concentrations of 0 . 1 - 1 nm against murine leukemias and solid tumors . it acts as a pkc activator at a concentration of ≈ 3 nm in k562 cells , and regulates cell cycle progression at the g1 / s phase through the suppression of cdc25a and subsequent inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase 2 ( cdk2 ) ( 100 % inhibition achieved at 5 ng / ml ). gnidimacrin is a heterocyclic natural product similar to bryostatin , but somewhat smaller ( mw = 774 . 9 ). iripallidal is a bicyclic triterpenoid isolated from iris pallida . iripallidal displays anti - proliferative activity in a nci 60 cell line screen with g150 ( concentration required to inhibit growth by 50 %) values from micromolar to nanomolar range . it binds to pkcα with high affinity ( ki = 75 . 6 nm ). it induces phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 in a rasgrp3 - dependent manner . m . w . 486 . 7 . iripallidal is only about half the size of bryostatin and lacks charged groups . ingenol is a diterpenoid related to phorbol but possesses much less toxicity . it is derived from the milkweed plant euphorbia peplus . ingenol 3 , 20 - dibenzoate , for example , competes with [ 3h ] phorbol dibutyrate for binding to pkc ( ki for binding = 240 nm ) ( winkler et al . ( 1995 ) j . org . chem . 60 : 1381 ; incorporated herein by reference ). ingenol - 3 - angelate possesses antitumor activity against squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma when used topically ( ogbourne et al . ( 2007 ) anticancer drugs . 18 : 357 ; incorporated herein by reference ). napthalenesulfonamides , including n -( n - heptyl )- 5 - chloro - 1 - naphthalenesulfonamide ( sc - 10 ) and n -( 6 - phenylhexyl )- 5 - chloro - 1 - naphthalenesulfonamide , are members of another class of pkc activators . sc - 10 activates pkc in a calcium - dependent manner , using a mechanism similar to that of phosphatidylserine ( ito et al . ( 1986 ) biochemistry 25 : 4179 ; incorporated herein by reference ). naphthalenesulfonamides act by a different mechanism from bryostatin and would be expected to show a synergistic effect with bryostatin or a member of another class of pkc activators . structurally , naphthalenesulfonamides are similar to the calmodulin ( cam ) antagonist w - 7 , but are reported to have no effect on cam kinase . the linoleic acid derivative dcp - la ( 2 -[( 2 - pentylcyclopropyl ) methyl ] cyclopropaneoctanoic acid ) is one of the few known isoform - specific activators of pkc known . dcp - la selectively activates pkcε with a maximal effect at 100 nm . ( kanno el al . ( 2006 ) j . lipid res . 47 : 1146 ). like sc - 10 , dcp - la interacts with the phosphatidylserine binding site of pkc , instead of the diacylglycerol binding site . an alternative approach to activating pkc directly is to increase the levels of the endogenous activator , diacylglycerol . diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors such as 6 -( 2 -( 4 -[( 4 - fluorophenyl ) phenylmethylene ]- 1 - piperidinyl ) ethyl )- 7 - methyl - 5h - thiazolo [ 3 , 2 - a ] pyrimidin - 5 - one ( r59022 ) and [ 3 -[ 2 -[ 4 -( bis -( 4 - fluorophenyl ) methylene ] piperidin - 1 - yl ) ethyl ]- 2 , 3 - dihydro - 2 - thioxo - 4 ( 1h )- quinazolinone ( r59949 ) enhance the levels of the endogenous ligand diacylglycerol , thereby producing activation of pkc ( meinhardt et al . ( 2002 ) anti - cancer drugs 13 : 725 ). a variety of growth factors , such as fibroblast growth factor 18 ( fgf - 18 ) and insulin growth factor , function through the pkc pathway . fgf - 18 expression is upregulated in learning and receptors for insulin growth factor have been implicated in learning . activation of the pkc signaling pathway by these or other growth factors offers an additional potential means of activating protein kinase c . growth factor activators , such as the 4 - methyl catechol derivatives , such as 4 - methylcatcchol acetic acid ( mcba ), that stimulate the synthesis and / or activation of growth factors such as ngf and bdnf , also activate pkc as well as convergent pathways responsible for synaptogenesis and / or neuritic branching . the present compounds can be administered by a variety of routes and in a variety of dosage forms including those for oral , rectal , parenteral ( such as subcutaneous , intramuscular and intravenous ), epidural , intrathecal , intra - articular , topical and buccal administration . the dose range for adult human beings will depend on a number of factors including the age , weight and condition of the patient and the administration route . all books , articles , patents or other publications and references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties . reference to any compound herein includes the racemate as well as the single enantiomers . the following examples serve to further illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting its scope in any way . rats ( male , wistar , 200 - 225 g ) were randomly divided into 6 groups ( 8 each ) and housed for 1 week before experimentation . transient or permanent restriction of cerebral blood flow and oxygen supply results in ischemic stroke . the global ischemia model used to induce vascular memory impairment was two - vessel occlusion combined with a short term systemic hypoxia . ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries was performed under anesthesia ( pentobarbital , 60 mg / kg , i . p .). after a one - week recovery from the surgery , rats were exposed to 14 - min hypoxia ( 5 % oxygen in a glass jar ). control rats ( sham operated and vehicle controls ) were subjected to the same incision to isolate both common carotid arteries and to 14 - min air ( in the glass jar ). body temperature was kept at 37 - 37 . 5 ° c . using a heating light source during the surgical procedure and until the animals were fully recovered . bryostatin - 1 was administered at 20 μg / m 2 ( tail i . v ., 2 doses / week , for 10 doses ), starting 24 hours after the end of the hypoxic event . 4 - methylcatechol - diacetic acid ( mcda , a potential ngf and bdnf booster ) was administered at 1 . 0 mg / kg ( i . p ., daily for the same 5 - week period ) in separate groups of rats . one week after the last bryostatin - 1 , mcda , or vehicle administration , rats were trained in the water maze spatial learning task ( 2 training trials per day for 4 days ), followed by a probe test . a visible platform test was given after the probe test . the results are shown in fig1 . overall , there was a significant learning difference between the 6 groups ( fig1 ; f 5 . 383 = 27 . 480 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ; anova ). detailed analysis revealed that the ischemic group did not learn the spatial maze task since there was no significant difference in escape latency over trials ( f 7 , 63 = 0 . 102 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ), a significantly impaired learning as compared with the control rats ( group difference : f 1 , 127 = 79 . 751 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ), while the rats in the other 5 groups all learned the task ( the ischemic rats with mcda treatment : p & lt ; 0 . 05 and the other 4 groups : p & lt ; 0 . 001 over trials ). bryostatin - 1 therapy greatly improved the performance ( ischemic group with bryostatin - 1 treatment vs . ischemic rats : f 1 , 127 = 72 . 782 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ), to the level of performance that did not differ statistically from the control rats ( ischemic group with bryostatin - 1 treatment vs . control rats : f 1 , 127 = 0 . 001 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ). mcda treatment also improved the learning of the ischemic rats ( ischemia with ncda treatment vs . ischemic rats : f 1 , 127 = 15 . 584 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ) but the difference between the ischemia with mcda treatment and control rats remained significant after the 5 week treatment ( ischemia with ncda treatment vs . control rats : f 1 , 127 = 16 . 618 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ). there were no differences between the control and bryostatin - 1 - only groups ( bryostatin - 1 vs . control : f 1 , 127 = 0 . 010 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ) and between the control and mcda - only groups ( mcda vs . control : f 1 , 127 = 0 . 272 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ). the rats in the ischemic group did not show a target preference in the probe test ( f3 , 31 = 0 . 096 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ), while the rats of the other 5 groups all showed a target quadrant preference in the probe test ( all p & lt ; 0 . 005 ). data were analyzed using target quadrant ratio ( dividing the target quadrant distance by the average of the non - target quadrant values during the probe test ; fig2 ). there was a significant difference in the target quadrant ratios between the groups ( f5 , 47 = 5 . 081 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ). detailed analysis revealed group differences between the control and ischemic rats ( f1 , 15 = 9 . 451 , p & lt ; 0 . 01 ), between the ischemic and ischemic with bryostatin - 1 treatment ( f1 , 15 = 10 . 328 , p & lt ; 0 . 01 ), and between the ischemic with mcda treatment and ischemic rats ( f1 , 15 = 5 . 623 , p & lt ; 0 . 05 ), but no differences between the control and ischemic rats with bryostatin - 1 treatment ( f1 , 15 = 0 . 013 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ), between the ischemic with mcda treatment and control groups ( f1 , 15 = 2 . 997 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ), between the control and bryostatin - l - only rats ( f1 , 15 = 0 . 064 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ), and between the control and the mcda - only rats ( f1 , 15 = 0 . 0392 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ). a visible platform test , determined after the probe test revealed no significant difference between the groups ( f5 , 47 = 0 . 115 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ), indicating that there were no significant group differences in sensorimotor ability of the rats . global cerebral ischemia / hypoxia was induced in male wistar rats ( 225 - 250 g ) by permanently occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries , combined with about 14 minutes of low oxygen ( about 5 %). bryostatin - 1 was administered at 15 μg / m 2 ( via a tail vein , 2 doses / week , for 10 doses ), starting about 24 hours after the end of the ischemic / hypoxic event . spatial learning ( 2 trials / day for 4 days ) and memory ( a probe test of 1 minute , 24 hours after the last trial ) task was performed 9 days after the last dose . overall , there was a significant difference between the groups ( f3 , 255 = 31 . 856 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ) and groups x trials ( f21 , 255 = 1 . 648 , p & lt ; 0 . 05 ). global cerebral ischemia impaired the spatial learning ( ischemial vs . sham - operated f1 , 127 = 79 . 751 , p & gt ; 0 . 001 ). the learning impairment was restored by bryostatin - 1 treatment ( bryostatin - 1 + ischemia vs . ischemia : f1 , 127 = 50 . 233 , p & lt ; 0 . 001 ), while bryostatin - 1 alone did not affect the learning ( bryostatin - 1 vs . sham - operated : f1 , 127 = 2 . 258 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ; 9 days after the last dose ). in the memory retention test , sham - operated rats showed a target quadrant preference . such good memory retention was not observed in the ischemic rats , indicating an impaired spatial memory . bryostatin - 1 therapy effectively restored memory retention after ischemia to the level of the sham - operated rats . bryostatin - 1 alone had no significant effects in the target quadrant preference compared with that of the sham - operated control rats . there was a significant difference in the quadrant ratios ( calculated by dividing the target quadrant swim distance by the average swim distance in the non - target quadrants ; f3 , 31 = 6 . 181 , p & lt ; 0 . 005 ) between the groups . detailed analysis revealed significant differences between the ischemic rats and sham - operated control rats ( f1 , 15 = 9 . 451 , p & lt ; 0 . 01 ), between the ischemic rats and ischemic rats with bryostatin - 1 treatment ( f1 , 15 = 10 . 328 , p & lt ; 0 . 01 ), but no significant differences between the ischemic rats with bryostatin - 1 treatment and sham - operated control ( f1 , 15 = 0 . 0131 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ) and between the sham - operated control rats and bryostatin - 1 alone rats ( f1 , 15 = 0 . 161 , p & gt ; 0 . 05 ). these results demonstrate that the cerebral ischemia / hypoxia produced an impairment of spatial learning and memory , tested about 7 weeks after the ischemic event . the impairment was lasting and not recoverable , during the time frame without appropriate intervention , but restored by chronic bryostatin - 1 treatment , even when the treatment was started 24 hours after the ischemic event , a wide therapeutic time window .",0
"in accordance with the figures , the mixing device is comprised of a sheath ( 4 ) which surrounds the injection tube ( 1 ), said sheath being connected to a decompressor ( 2 ) and ending in a helical tube ( 3 ) coupled to the decompressor ( 2 ), said helical tube being the only fluid outlet . attached to the injection tube ( 1 ) is a tube ( 5 ) for entry of one of the fluids , while attached to the sheath ( 4 ) is a tube ( 6 ) for entry of the second fluid . the abovementioned components can be joined to form a single part . the injection tube ( 1 ) is a rectilinear tube , with a smooth inside and the outside formed at least by a complete helical spiral whose pitch is twice the outside diameter of the tube , and its end , which constitutes around 1 / 10 of its total length , is slightly conical and smooth ( no spiral ). its length is equal to the distance between the top end of the sheath and the part of the decompressor ( 2 ) with the largest diameter ( top end of the cone of the decompressor ( 2 )), if the transporting fluid is injected through the inside of the injection tube ( 1 ) through tube ( 5 )— fig2 , or equal to the distance between the top end of the sheath ( 4 ) and the part of the decompressor ( 2 ) with the smallest diameter ( bottom end of the cone of the decompressor ( 2 )), if the transporting fluid is injected via the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ) through tube ( 6 )— fig1 . the cross - section of the inside of the injection tube ( 1 ), because it is smaller than the cross - section of inlet ( 5 ), causes an increase in speed and a consequent depression in the transporting fluid when it is injected through the said inlet ( 5 ), and the area formed by the difference between the cross - section of the decompressor ( 2 ) with the smallest diameter and the cross - section of the outside of the injection tube at its end ( no spiral ), because it is smaller than the cross - section formed by the height of the spiral with its pitch and smaller also than the cross - section of inlet ( 6 ), causes an increase in speed and a consequent depression in the transporting fluid when it is injected through the said inlet ( 6 ). the purpose of the helical spiral is to create helical movement and force against the walls of the decompressor ( 2 ) ( centrifugal force ) in all the fluid that circulates outside the injection tube ( 1 ). the end of the injection tube on the outside is slightly conical and smooth ( no spiral ) and it has the function of stabilising and uniformising the flow of the fluid that exits the said injection tube ( 1 ). the purpose of the outflow of the fluid , with helical movement and centrifugal force , to the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ), by the action of the helical spiral , is to enable the suction fluid to be dragged inside the transporting fluid in the helical tube ( 3 ), if the transporting fluid is injected through inlet ( 6 ), thus allowing the suction fluid to be totally enveloped inside the transporting fluid , or to enable the suction fluid to be dragged outside the transporting fluid in the decompressor ( 2 ), if the transporting fluid is injected through inlet ( 5 ), thereby achieving greater agitation of the two fluids due to the conflict between the movement and rectilinear force of the transporting fluid and the helical movement and centrifugal force of the suction fluid . the decompressor ( 2 ) is a conical tube which constitutes a nozzle with an angle of between 0 ° and 45 °, extending from the end of the sheath ( 4 ) to a rectilinear part of length equal to or greater than the length of the sheath ( 4 ). the length of the conical part is determined by its angle . its cross - section at the top is the same as the cross - section of the sheath ( 4 ) to which it is connected , and its cross - section at the bottom is the same as the cross - section of inlet ( 5 ). the size of the angle is determined by the expansion cone of the transporting fluid , which depends on the injection pressure when it is injected through inlet ( 5 ), so that the intersection between the said cone and the downstream extension of the cone of the decompressor occurs in the rectilinear part of the decompressor ( 2 ). if the transporting fluid is injected through inlet ( 6 ), the size of the angle determines the area of injection pressure and the thickness of the “ sleeve ” of transporting fluid . its function is to decompress the transporting fluid , join the fluids coming from the two inlets ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and cause the dragging of the fluid that creates suction when the transporting fluid is injected through inlet ( 5 ) with a high suction flow , due to the existence of the angle in the decompressor ( 2 ) and the high agitation that causes the fluids to mix due to the conflict between the force and rectilinear movement of the transporting fluid and the centrifugal force and helical movement of the suction fluid . the helical tube ( 3 ) coupled to the decompressor ( 2 ) constitutes the only outlet and it is connected to the decompressor . its cross - section must be equal to the cross - section of the outlet of the decompressor ( 2 ) and its shape is determined by the injection inlet . if the transporting fluid is injected through the inside of the injection tube ( 1 ), i . e . through tube ( 5 ), the helical tube ( 3 ) can be removed or replaced by a rectilinear tube ; if the transporting fluid is injected via the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ), i . e . through tube ( 6 ), the helical tube ( 3 ) is at least a complete helicoid with the same pitch as that of the spirals around the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ). in this situation , after receiving the injection fluid with helical movement and force against the walls ( centrifugal force ), and inside this “ sleeve ” of transporting fluid the second suction fluid coming from inlet ( 5 ), its function is to mix these two fluids when they circulate through the said helical tube ( 3 ). in fact , when the two fluids ( the transporting fluid which forms a “ sleeve ” against the walls of the tube and the second fluid which is sucked inside the said “ sleeve ” of transporting fluid ) flow through the said helical tube ( 3 ) they meet with resistance along the bends , where they come up against obstacles that cause successive variations in speed and lead to a reduction in the centrifugal force that drove the transporting fluid , i . e . a centripetal component is created . these variations tend to convert the helical movement of the fluid at the inlet into rectilinear movement of the fluid at the outlet , and this conversion of force and movement causes the dragging of the suction fluid , with the total mixing of the two fluids . the sheath ( 4 ) is a rectilinear tube which surrounds the injection tube ( 1 ), it is coupled to an inlet tube ( 6 ) through which the suction fluid or injection fluid enters via the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ) and it constitutes the fundamental component of the device as all the other elements are connected to it . the tube ( 5 ) coupled to the injection tube ( 1 ) constitutes the inlet through the inside of the injection tube and it adjusts the latter tube to the sheath by means of an element which , in the embodiment represented in the figure , has an area where the converging fluid passes . its shape can nevertheless be undifferentiated and its cross - section will have to be larger than the cross - section of the inside of the injection tube ( 1 ). its function is to receive one of the fluids , the transporting fluid or the fluid to be dragged . the tube ( 6 ) connected to the sheath ( 4 ) constitutes the inlet via the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ). its shape is undifferentiated and its cross - section will have to be larger than the differential between the cross - section of the part of the decompressor ( 2 ) with the smallest diameter and the cross - section of the outside of the end of the injection tube ( 1 ) ( no spiral ). its function is to receive the transporting fluid or the fluid to be dragged . the device of this invention has two operating principles , according to the inlet used for the transporting fluid , as follows : a ) injection of the transporting fluid via the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ) through tube ( 6 )— fig1 . the transporting fluid is compressed at the end of the injection tube ( 1 ) against the wall of the decompressor ( 2 ) with the smallest diameter , where the area where the transporting fluid passes is smaller than the area formed by the height of the spiral with its pitch and smaller also than the cross - section of inlet ( 6 ), thereby increasing the injection speed . due to the influence of the spiral around the injection tube ( 1 ), the transporting fluid acquires helical movement with force against the wall of the decompressor ( 2 ) ( centrifugal force ), which is stabilised and uniformised at the end of the injection tube in the part with no spiral . in the decompressor ( 2 ), the second fluid ( suction fluid ) is drawn inside the first fluid or transporting fluid ( injection fluid ), which forms a kind of “ sleeve ”, each fluid maintaining its relative position until reaching the helical tube ( 3 ). in this tube ( 3 ), part of the fluids varies its speed along the bends , slowing down on the longer bends in relation to the other part of the fluids , which travels more quickly and with force towards the centre of tube ( 3 ) ( centripetal force ) on the shorter bends , thereby causing the dragging of the suction fluid , which is compressed by the transporting fluid thus causing the two fluids to totally mix , converting the centrifugal force and helical movement of the fluids at the inlet into force and rectilinear movement at the outlet of the said helical tube ( 3 ). this is the ideal way to carry out extraction with neutralisation of pollutants coming , for example , from chimneys . the most significant example has as a transporting fluid water injected into tube ( 6 ) by means of a pump ( not shown ) and as a fluid to be dragged a gaseous fluid possibly loaded with pollutant elements . b ) injection through the inside of the injection tube ( 1 )— fig2 . the transporting fluid is compressed inside the injection tube and when it expands inside the decompressor ( 2 ) it forms an expansion cone which depends on the injection pressure , intercepting the suction fluid in the rectilinear part of the decompressor ( 2 ). this depends on the angle of the decompressor ( 2 ) and on the injection pressure of the transporting fluid . the force and rectilinear movement of the transporting fluid cause the dragging of the suction fluid which frictionally mixes with the first fluid ( injection fluid ) due to the centrifugal force and helical movement created on the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ) inside this suction fluid . this conflict between the forces and movements of the two fluids facilitates possible chemical reactions between the fluids and / or particles . it is the ideal way to naturally oxygenate water by means of forced aeration inside the apparatus . the most significant example uses water as a transporting fluid injected by means of a pump ( not shown ) into tube ( 5 ) and injection tube ( 1 ), and atmospheric air as a second fluid to be dragged and available through tube ( 6 ) and the outside of the injection tube ( 1 ), these fluids mixing intimately inside the rectilinear part of the decompressor ( 2 ), providing excellent oxygenation of water , for example swimming pool water . the flow of the suction fluid increases with the flow of the injection fluid and the two increase with the increase in injection pressure . the fluid mixing device is a technically simple piece of equipment that effectively resolves environmental problems . the use of the characteristics of extraction with the total mixing of the suction elements by the transporting fluid makes the equipment effective in the chemical neutralization of air , together with the extraction of the pollution of a chimney . the use of the characteristics of suction with the conflict between the force and movement of the two fluids makes the equipment ideal for aerating water and effluents . the method is efficient in the oxidation of nutrients existing in water ( grease , iron , nitrates , etc .) and in the aerobic respiration of bacteria in effluents due to the high klav content . as aeration occurs inside the apparatus , this avoids any environmental impact in the case of the aeration of effluents . the characteristics of high flow rate and suction force make the apparatus an alternative to its use as a vacuum pump . the characteristics of compression and expansion of the transporting fluid with centrifugal force make it possible to directly transfer heat from one fluid to the other .",8
"silicon - type charge transporting compounds according to our invention have an ionization potential of 4 . 5 - 6 . 2 ev . when the ionization potential is less than 4 . 5 ev , the silicon - type charge transporting material is easily oxidized and deteriorated making it undesirable . when the ionization potential exceeds 6 . 2 ev , injection of charge from the charge generating layer is inhibited , resulting in decreased sensitivity making it undesirable . the ionization potential in our invention was measured by open - air photoelectric spectrometry using surface analyzer ac - 1 manufactured by riken keiki . in the silicon - type charge transporting material provided by our invention , the organic silicon group is bonded to an electron - donor group via a hydrocarbon group . the reason is that if it is bonded directly , the π electron of the aromatic group in the charge transporting material is affected by the π - d interaction effect with the d electron of silicon ; changing the ionization potential from that of the base material . bonding via a hydrocarbon group prevents this phenomenon and facilitates designing of the organic photoconductor . one method of introducing a hydrocarbon group between an aromatic ring and a silicon atom is to bond an unsaturated aliphatic group to at least one of multiple aromatic rings in the charge transporting compound , with an alkoxysilane whose essential substituent for the silicon atom is hydrogen and an alkoxy group , by means of a hydrosilylation reaction . for example , the silicon - type charge transporting material may be manufactured by means of a hydrosilylation reaction between a vinyl group substituted onto an aromatic ring bonded to nitrogen of an aromatic substituted tertiary amine whose ionization potential is 4 . 5 - 6 . 2 ev , and an organic silicon compound with a hydrogen bonded to silicon . one method of introducing the vinyl group to the aromatic group is to first formylate the hydrogen or the methyl group on the aromatic ring , then convert the resulted aldehyde group to the vinyl group by the wittig reaction , thus allowing introduction of the vinyl group . after this process , the hydrosilylation reaction can be employed . another method would be to bromomethylate a saturated hydrocarbon group such as methyl , which has been substituted onto the aromatic group , producing a lithio - complex , and then reacting this with a halogenated alkoxysilane . the aromatic substituted tertiary amine a with an ionization potential of 4 . 5 - 6 . 2 ev used in the method of our invention may constitute any of the compounds shown below , where me is methyl , et is ethyl , ph is phenyl , bu is butyl , and pr is propyl . ## str1 ## following are representative ionization and oxidation potentials for some of the aromatic substituted tertiary amines a shown above . these ionization and oxidation potentials refer to the specific compounds identified above with corresponding reference indicia . there is no limitation as to which position on the aromatic ring of the tertiary amine that the alkoxysilane be introduced . nor is it necessary for alkoxysilane groups to be bonded to all aromatic rings . such determinations are made by considering factors such as solubility in the polysiloxane resin . in this case , the method of introducing a vinyl group to an aromatic ring bonded to nitrogen is to formylate the hydrogen or the methyl group substituted on the aromatic ring , and then to convert the aldehyde group to the vinyl group by the wittig reaction ; thus allowing the introduction of the vinyl group as described above . it can also be produced by means of the dehydrohalogenation between the hydrogen on the secondary amine and the halogenated aromatic group compound which has been substituted by the vinyl group . the hydrogenated organic silicon compound which is able to react with the vinyl group bonded to an aromatic ring of tertiary amine a with ionization potential of 4 . 5 - 6 . 2 ev , is a hydrogenated organic silicon compound whose substituent on the silicon atom in its molecule is hydrogen or an alkoxy group . this compound is added to the vinyl group by a hydrosilylation reaction . hydrogen directly bonded to silicon is an indispensable component of the hydrosilylation reaction to add to the vinyl group . another indispensable component is a hydrolyzable group , such as an alkoxy group -- or 3 . r 3 of the alkoxy group can be a short chain , i . e ., 1 - 6 carbon atoms , such as methyl , ethyl , propyl , butyl , amyl , and hexyl ; or r 3 can be a branched alkyl . the selection is made depending on the intended use of the product , stability during hydrosilylation , process and hydrolyzable properties . integer n in the formula denotes the number of alkoxy groups substituted on silicon . when n is higher than 1 , the hydrophilic property of the compound is improved . when there are several groups that are able to be condensed , the compound also acts as a cross - linking agent , so the selection must be made taking into account the hardness of the resin as a result of cross - linking , as well as its hydrophilic property . organic group r 2 other than hydrogen and alkoxy which is directly bonded to the silicon atom , may be selected according to the type of substituent on the silicon atom in the polysiloxane resin , and according to the various purposes such as the solubility in the resin , reactivity for the hydrosilylation reaction , and other property adjustments of the polysiloxane resin . r 2 may be an alkyl group such as methyl , ethyl , propyl , butyl , amyl , and hexyl ; alkenyl such as vinyl and allyl ; halogenated hydrocarbon groups ; aryl such as phenyl ; alkaryl such as tolyl ; and fluorohydrocarbon groups represented by trifluoropropyl , heptafluoropentyl , and nonafluorohexyl . if the substituent on silicon in the polysiloxane resin is methyl , the solubility is better if r 2 is methyl . the polysiloxane resin is a resin soluble in organic solvents , and primarily constituting silicon - type macromolecules known as mt resins , mq resins , t resins , and polysilsesquioxanes . methods of manufacturing such resins are known , such as the method described on page 71 of &# 34 ; silicon - based polymer science &# 34 ;, edited by john m . ziegler and f . w . gordon fearon , acs series 224 , the american chemical society ( 1990 ). the hydrosilylation reaction may be conducted using a platinum catalyst or an organic peroxide catalyst . the platinum catalyst can be a platinum compound used in standard hydrosilylation reactions and addition - type silicone rubber ; platinum chloride ; chloroplatinic acid ; platinum - olefin complexes ; platinum - phosphine complexes ; substances in which platinum is supported by a carrier such as platinum / carbon , platinum / silica gel , and platinum / macromolecules . the quantity of platinum catalyst is that amount used conventionally . in terms of mole ratio , the quantity of platinum metal to alkenyl groups of electron - donor groups should be within the range of 1 / 100 to 1 / 100 , 000 . the hydrosilylation reaction temperature varies depending on the type of platinum catalyst used , its quantity , reaction group materials , and reaction conditions . however , from the standpoint of efficiency , it is desirable that the temperature be below the decomposition temperature of the platinum catalyst , i . e ., below 200 ° c . in the case of an organic peroxide catalyst , the only limitation is that its half - life be above room temperature . organic peroxides which are useful are radical polymerization initiators such as lauryl peroxide , butyl peroxide , and benzoyl peroxide . products of hydrosilylation reactions can be divided into two groups . in one group , the silicon atom is added to the alpha position of the vinyl group . in the other group , the silicon atom is added to the beta position of the vinyl group . the position depends on reaction conditions , such as type of vinyl compound substituent and type of catalyst used . in our invention , there is no adverse effect of a mixture of the alpha - additions and beta - additions in the hydrosilylation process . in fact , having a mixture is preferable since it prevents aggregation of electron hole transferring materials which tend to easily form aggregates . the following examples illustrate our invention in more detail . 101 . 4 g of triphenylamine and 35 . 5 ml of dimethyl formamide ( dmf ) were placed in a three -

"referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or similar elements throughout the several views , there is shown generally in fig1 a diagrammatic view of the optical configuration for a radiation scanning system 10 for scanning and imaging an object field 11 . the scanning system 10 comprises tunable resonant scanners forming a cascaded line scan mirror system coupled through a spherical reflector subsystem . the radiation scanning system 10 uses a spherical reflector 12 to relay the pupils of the scan mirrors without pupil shift . the spherical reflector 12 is designed to have a predetermined center of curvature and a predetermined radius of curvature . the spherical reflector 12 also includes direct and reflected optical axes , the direct optical axis coincident with the line r &# 39 ; s and the reflected ( from one reflecting surface of a slotted folding mirror 20 ) optical axis coincident with line r &# 39 ; s , coincident with the principal axis of the spherical reflector 12 , as illustrated in fig1 . the spherical reflector 12 has a substantially spherical focal surface as represented generally by element 13 , the spherical focal surface 13 including an intermediate focal line 13a of predetermined de minimus width as described hereinbelow in more detail . the scanning system 10 of fig1 employs a pair of line scan mirrors , a first line scan mirror 14 and a second line scan mirror 16 , which are mounted on tunable resonant scanners . positionally , the reflecting surface of the first line scan mirror 14 can be visualized as being located in a plane orthogonal , at the midpoint of the scan angle or field - of - view ( fov ) of the mirror , to the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s . the reflecting surface of the second line scan mirror 16 , however , is not orthogonal to the reflected optical axis r &# 39 ; s . the reflecting surface is perpendicular to the reflected optical axis r &# 39 ; s in the direction of rotation at the midpoint scan position , but the axis of rotation sm of the second line scan mirror 16 is canted from perpendicularity to the reflected optical axis r &# 39 ; s by several degrees so that incident radiation from a field scanning element 26 is reflected so as to intercept the surface of the spherical reflector 12 . the reflecting surfaces of the first and second line scan mirrors 14 , 16 , respectively , are positioned a predetermined distance from the spherical reflector 12 equal to the radius of curvature thereof . as shown in fig1 the first line scan mirror 14 has a rotational axis fm about which the mirror 14 oscillates . the scan angle oscillation of the first line scan mirror 14 at a predetermined fundamental frequency f f and scan amplitude a f is exemplarily illustrated by arrow 18 . the rotational axis fm of the first line scan mirror 14 is disposed orthogonally to the optical axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 to achieve near distortion free scanning . a slotted folding mirror 20 has opposed , planar reflecting surfaces 21a , 21b and a narrow slot 22 extending therethrough between the reflecting surfaces . the slotted folding mirror 20 is positioned on the optical axis r &# 39 ; s between the first line scan mirror 14 and the spherical reflector 12 . the slotted folding mirror 20 is disposed so that the intermediate focal line 13a of the spherical reflector 12 is coincident with or closely adjacent to the narrow slot 22 of the slotted folding mirror 20 . the first line scan mirror 14 is centered on the optical axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 at a distance equal to the radius of curvature of the spherical reflector 12 . the first line scan mirror 14 is disposed so that the narrow slot 22 of the slotted folding mirror 20 is scanned during oscillation about the rotational axis fm . in radiometric applications a radiance reference source ( not shown ) can be disposed at both ends of the narrow slot 22 . the second line scan mirror 16 has a rotational axis sm and oscillates thereabout at a selected frequency f s as exemplarily illustrated by arrow 24 . the selected frequency f s may be a harmonic of the predetermined fundamental frequency f f to achieve near linear line scans . the amplitude a s of the secondary oscillation is significantly less than the amplitude a f of the fundamental oscillation . because of the smaller amplitude a s of the secondary oscillation , the rotational axis sm of the second line scan mirror 16 can readily be canted some 30 degrees off orthogonality from the reflected optical axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 with insignificant distortion of the object field 11 . the second line scan mirror 16 is centered on the reflected optical axis r &# 39 ; s at a distance equal to the radius of curvature from the spherical reflector 12 . the first line scan mirror 14 and the second line scan mirror 16 are phase locked wherein the predetermined amplitude a f of the predetermined fundamental frequency f f is combined with the predetermined amplitude a s of the selected frequency f s . the net effect is that the radiation scanning system 10 produces line scans of the object field 11 at a near constant line scan rate , i . e ., as if the object field 11 were scanned by a single scanner driven to provide a substantially triangular waveform , when the second line scan mirror 16 is oscillated at a selected frequency f s which is a harmonic of the predetermined fundamental frequency f f . by way of example only , if the first line scan mirror is scanned at a frequency of 4 mhz , the second line scan mirror would optimally be driven at the 12 mhz harmonic . further , the amplitude of the harmonic frequency would be approximately one tenth of the predetermined amplitude of the fundamental frequency . alternatively , when the second line scan mirror 16 is oscillated at a selected frequency f s which is equal to the fundamental frequency f f , the radiation scanning system 10 is able to generate wider scan angles with respect to the object field 11 . other elements of the radiation scanning system 10 include the field scan mirror 26 , a detector lens 28 , and a detector 30 . the field scan mirror 26 has a rotational axis fs . the field scan mirror 26 , which is oversized in the direction of the rotational axis fs , is driven by a sawtooth waveform . within the physical and functional constraints of the scanning system 10 , the field scan mirror 26 is disposed as close as possible to the second line scan mirror 16 to minimize the amount of pupil shift . for applications which use only a single line scan mirror the field scan mirror 26 is substituted for the second line scan mirror 16 in the optical configuration . the geometric orientation of the axis of rotation fs of the field scan mirror 26 does not change , but the reflective surface is reorientated by rotation about the rotational axis fs so that the incident radiation from the object field 11 is reflected to intercept the surface of the spherical reflector 12 . for systems applications requiring only line scans , e . g ., where there is relative movement between the radiation scanning system 10 and the object field 11 or where a single line is to be continuously scanned , the field scan mirror 26 is eliminated from the optical configuration . the detector 30 is disposed at an object point of the detector lens 28 . the disposition of the detector lens 28 with respect to the first line scan mirror 14 and the slotted folding mirror 20 is best explained in terms of an image point of the detector lens 28 by considering the detector 30 as a point object on the optical axis of the radiation scanning system 10 to be imaged by means of the detector lens 28 . the converging radiation exiting the detector lens 28 is reflected by the slotted folding mirror 20 and the first line scan mirror 14 . the radiation reflected by first line scan mirror 14 converges to form the point image of the detector 30 on the intermediate focal line 13a . as the first line scan mirror 14 oscillates about the rotational axis fm , the point image of the detector 30 translates back and forth along the intermediate focal line 13a of the spherical reflector 12 . thus , the image point of the detector lens 28 coincides with the intermediate focal line 13a defined by the spherical reflector 12 . the optical speed ( f - number ) of the converging radiation from the detector lens 28 should match the optical speed ( f - number ) of the spherical reflector 12 . in operation , with the object field 11 sufficiently distant such that radiation therefrom appears essentially as collimated radiation at the radiation scanning system 10 , the object field 11 is scanned a field at a time by means of the field scan mirror 26 . the sawtooth driven field scan mirror 26 exhibits a scan rate such that the first line scan mirror 14 provides an output of contiguous or near contiguous line scans . typically , two field patterns are interlaced to provide a complete frame . the radiation emanating from the object field 11 is reflected from the field scan mirror 26 to the second line scan mirror 16 and reflected therefrom . the collimated radiation reflected from the second line scan mirror 16 is reflected from the first reflecting surface 21a of the slotted folding mirror 20 to the spherical reflector 12 . the radiation reflected from the spherical reflector 12 focuses at the intermediate focal line 13a and passes through the narrow slot 22 of the slotted folded mirror 20 . the radiation diverges from the intermediate focal line 13a and is reflected from the first line scan mirror 14 and from the second reflecting surface 21b of the slotted folding mirror 20 . the diverging radiation reflected from the slotted folding mirror 20 is refracted by the detector lens 28 and converges to a focus at the detector 30 . the width of the narrow slot 22 is minimally sized , but sufficient to allow the reflected radiation to pass through the slotted folding mirror 20 . the narrow slot 22 will produce some minor obscuration in the system pupil . the optical configuration of another embodiment of a radiation scanning system 40 according to the present invention is diagrammatically depicted in fig2 . this scanning system 40 eliminates the slotted folding mirror 20 from the optical configuration of fig1 . eliminating the slotted folding mirror 20 in this embodiment removes two reflective surfaces from the optical configuration as well as eliminating the minor obscuration in the system pupil caused by the narrow slot 22 in the slotted folding mirror 20 . but , while there is no central obscuration in this embodiment , there may be some image distortion for larger line scan angles . the radiation scanning system 40 uses the spherical reflector 12 to relay the pupils of the scan mirrors without pupil shift . the spherical reflector 12 of the radiation scanning system 40 is generally as described hereinabove for the radiation scanning system 10 . the relative disposition of the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 with respect to the other elements of the system 40 is shown in fig2 as is the relative spatial orientation of the intermediate focal line 13b . the scanning system 40 of fig2 utilizes the first line scan mirror 14 and the second line scan mirror 16 , mounted on tunable resonant scanners , as described hereinabove . in this embodiment , however , the first and second line scan mirrors 14 , 16 are offset from , but adjacent to the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 . the reflecting surfaces of the two line scan mirrors 14 , 16 are not orthogonal to the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s . the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular to the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s in the direction of rotation at the midpoint scan position , but the axes of rotation fm , hm of the first and second line scan mirrors 14 , 16 , respectively , must be canted from perpendicularity to the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s by several degrees so that incident radiation from the field scan mirror 26 is reflected by the second line scan mirror 16 in a direction to intercept the surface of the spherical reflector 12 . in turn , the reflected radiation from the spherical reflector 12 incident upon the first line scan mirror 14 is reflected therefrom to intercept the pupil of the detector lens 28 . the orientation of the second line scan mirror 16 with respect to the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s causes the intermediate focal line 13b to intersect the direct optical axis r &# 39 ; s , as illustrated . the canted orientation of the first line scan mirror 14 with respect to the axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 may create some minor distortion in the scanned image of the object field 11 in the field scan direction . this type of distortion is sometimes referred to as line scan bow . the amount of distortion for a given scan angle can be lessened , if necessary , by reducing the optical speed ( f - number ) of the spherical reflector 12 . this allows the axis of rotation for the first line scan mirror 14 to be more orthogonal to the optical axis r &# 39 ; s of the spherical reflector 12 . other elements of the radiation scanning system 40 include the field scan mirror 26 , the detector lens 28 , and the detector 30 as previously described for the embodiment of fig1 . the disposition of the detector lens 28 with respect to the first line scan mirror 14 is again best explained in terms of the object and image points of the detector lens 28 by considering the detector 30 disposed at the object point of the detector lens 28 . the detector lens 28 images the detector 30 on the intermediate focal line 13b of the radiation scanning system 40 . refracted radiation exiting the detector lens 28 is reflected by the first line scan mirror 14 to form the image of the detector 30 at a point on the intermediate focal line 13b . as the first line scan mirror 14 oscillates about the rotational axis fm , the focal point of the detector 30 translates back and forth along the intermediate focal line 13b of the spherical reflector 12 . thus , the image point of the detector lens 28 coincides with the intermediate focal line 13b of the spherical reflector 12 . in operation , with the object field 11 sufficiently distant such that radiation therefrom appears essentially as collimated radiation at the radiation scanning system 40 , the object field 11 is scanned a field at a time by means of the field scan mirror 26 . the radiation emanating from the object field 11 is reflected from the field scan mirror 26 to the second line scan mirror 16 and reflected therefrom . the collimated radiation reflected from the second line scan mirror 16 is reflected by the spherical reflector 12 . the collimated radiation reflected from the spherical reflector 12 converges to a focus at the intermediate focal line 13b and diverges therefrom to be reflected from the first line scan mirror 14 . the diverging radiation reflected from the first line scan mirror 14 is refracted by the detector lens 28 and converges to a focus at the detector 30 . the optical configurations disclosed in the embodiments of fig1 and 2 , respectively , may be utilized , in modified form , to optically couple a single line scan mirror supported on a multi - mode resonant torsional element through the spherical reflector 12 . the single multi - mode resonant line scan mirror replaces the first line scan mirror 14 in the optical configurations of fig1 and 2 . the torsional element is oscillated at the predetermined fundamental frequency f f as well as one or more phase locked harmonics of the fundamental frequency f f to produce a near linear driving waveform for the single multi - mode resonant line scan mirror . the frequencies of the multi - mode resonant torsional element may be optionally tunable . the field scan mirror 26 is substituted for the second line scan mirror 16 which is eliminated . the geometric orientation of the axis of rotation fs of the field scan mirror 26 is as described hereinabove . the reflective surface of the field scan mirror 26 is rotated about the rotational axis fs so that incident radiation from the object field 11 is reflected in a direction to intercept the surface of the spherical reflector 12 . alternatively , in yet further embodiments of the present invention , the optical configurations of fig1 and 2 , respectively , may be used , in modified form , to optically couple a line scan mirror mounted on an non - tunable resonant galvanometer through the spherical reflector 12 . the single mode line scan mirror replaces the first line scan mirror 14 in fig1 and 2 . the field scan mirror 26 is substituted for the second line scan mirror 16 which is eliminated . the geometric orientation of the axis of rotation fs of the field scan mirror 26 is as described hereinabove . the reflective surface of the field scan mirror 26 is rotated about rotational axis fs so that incident radiation from the object field 11 is reflected by the repositioned field scan mirror 26 to intercept the surface of the spherical reflector 12 . fig3 is a cross sectional view illustrating another embodiment of a radiation scanning system 50 according to the present invention , this scanning system 50 utilizing a set of four cascaded line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 ( two supplementary line scan mirrors , a first line scan mirror and a second line scan mirror , respectively ) mounted on tunable resonant scanners and three spherical reflectors 60 , 62 , 64 ( two supplementary spherical reflectors and a spherical reflector , respectively ). one specific spherical reflector 60 , 62 , 64 is interposed between each pair of optically adjacent line scan mirrors 52 - 54 , 54 - 56 , 56 - 58 , respectively , as depicted in fig3 . each of the line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 is in a respective plane which , at a mid - scan position , is perpendicular to the plane of the paper . the axis of rotation of line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 are canted from perpendicularity to the optical axes of the spherical reflectors 60 , 62 , 64 by several degrees so that the incident radiation from the preceding optical element is reflected in a direction to intercept the surface of the following optical element . the axis of rotation of line scan mirror 58 is canted to reflect the incident radiation from the field scan mirror 26 to the surface of the spherical reflector 64 . the axis of rotation of line scan mirror 56 is canted to reflect incident radiation from spherical reflector 64 to the surface of spherical reflector 62 . the axis of rotation of scan mirror 54 is canted to reflect the incident radiation from spherical reflector 62 to the surface of the spherical reflector 60 . finally , the axis of rotation of line scan mirror 52 is canted to reflect the incident radiation from spherical reflector 60 to the pupil of the detector lens 28 . in addition , the axis of rotation of each of the line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 is disposed as close as possible to the center of curvature of the corresponding spherical reflector 60 , 62 , 64 . the axes of rotation for the line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 in the embodiment depicted in fig3 lie in the plane of the paper . the field - of - view of this embodiment , in contrast to the fields - of - view of the embodiments previously disclosed hereinabove and as exemplarily illustrated by fig1 and 2 , is increased by a factor of two in both the line scan and field scan directions . this increase in the field - of - view is accomplished without changing the oscillatory amplitude of the line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 . alternatively , in lieu of increasing the field - of - view of the radiation scanning system 50 , the cascade configuration of the line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 can be utilized to further improve the scan linearity of the system 50 by locking the line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 to the fundamental frequency and the first , second and third harmonics thereof , respectively . alternatively , the harmonics may be locked to create a near sawtooth scan as opposed to the near triangular scan . the embodiment of fig3 exemparily illustrates a 2 : 1 object / image ratio for the spherical reflectors 60 , 62 . using the basic thin lens optical relationship an object distance of 1 . 5 times the focal length produces an image distance of 3 times the focal length . for spherical reflector 64 the object distance coincides with the focal length thereof . it is to be understood that other applications may require a different object / image ratio . the disposition of the elements forming the optical configuration of the radiation scanning system 50 of fig3 is best explained by considering the detector 30 as a point object on the optical axis of the scanning system 50 to be imaged by means of the detector lens 28 . the detector lens 28 images the detector 30 at a point on an image focal line 13c after reflection by the second supplementary line scan mirror 52 . the image focal line 13c coincides with the object focal line 13c 60 of the second supplementary spherical reflector 60 . the object focal line 13c 60 is a substantially spherical focal surface at a location which in this exemplary embodiment is 1 . 5 times the focal length of the second supplementary spherical reflector 60 . as the second supplementary line scan mirror 52 oscillates , the point image of the detector 30 translates back and forth along the object focal line 13c 60 . the converging radiation reflecting from the second supplementary spherical reflector 60 remains directed at the first supplementary line scan mirror 54 , disposed at the center of curvature of the second supplementary spherical reflector 60 , as the second supplementary line scan mirror 52 oscillates through its full scan angle . the converging radiation from the second supplementary spherical reflector 60 is directed to focus at the image focal line 13d after reflection from the first supplementary line scan mirror 54 . the image focal line 13d coincides with the object focal line 13d 62 of the first supplementary spherical reflector 62 . the object focal line 13d 62 is 3 times the focal length of second supplementary spherical reflector 60 and 1 . 5 times the focal length of the first supplementary spherical reflector 62 . it is a substantially spherical focal surface . by way of illustration only , the focal length of the first supplementary spherical reflector 62 of this exemplary embodiment is twice as long as the focal length of the second supplementary spherical reflector 60 . the focal length of the spherical reflector 64 defines an intermediate object focal line 13e 64 which is coincident with the substantially spherical focal surface of the image focal line 13e of the first supplementary spherical reflector 62 . the converging radiation reflecting from the first supplementary spherical reflector 62 remains directed at the first line scan mirror 56 as the first and second supplementary line scan mirrors 54 , 52 , respectively , oscillate through full scan angles . the converging radiation reflected from the first line scan mirror 56 is directed to focus at the intermediate focal line 13e . the collimated radiation reflected from the spherical reflector 64 remains directed at the second line scan mirror 58 as the preceding line scan mirrors 52 , 54 , 56 oscillate through their respective fields - of - view . the collimated radiation reflected from the second line scan mirror 58 is directed at the field scan mirror 26 , which , like previous embodiments , is oversized in the direction of its axis of rotation . similarly , the field scan mirror 26 is placed as close as possible to the second line scan mirror 58 to minimize pupil shift . while the foregoing embodiments have been described in terms of an optical configuration for a passive radiation scanning system , that is one utilizing radiation emitted by the object field 11 , it is to be understood that the foregoing optical configurations also have utility in both active and hybrid radiation scanning systems . in an active system , a source of radiation , for example a lasing apparatus , is substituted for the detector 30 depicted in fig1 and 3 and the optical radiation is transmitted through the optical configuration to be outputted as a collimated beam of radiation , typically rastered , which coacts with a display means , as for example a tv screen . one means for controlling a scanning mirror system of the type using two cascaded resonant line scan mirrors 14 , 16 oscillating at the predetermined fundamental frequency f f and the selected frequency f s which is a harmonic of the predetermined fundamental frequency f f is illustrated by the block diagram of fig4 . the control means illustrated is for a passive system , but the control approach is conceptually the same when applied to an active system . an active system can replace the detector 30 and its associated circuitry with a radiation source having appropriate drive circuitry . similarly a combined active / passive system can use a single optical scanning system with one set of mirror controls , but with separate controls for the detector and the radiation source . the detector 30 receives radiation serially from the object field 11 of interest through an optical configuration as depicted by radiation scanning system 10 or 40 . a circuit 72 provides appropriate bias and preamplification for the signal generated by the detector 30 . a circuit 74 provides a means for level and gain control of the video . the input to the detector 30 is repetitive in the form of left - to - right and right - to - left scan lines , as generated by the approximately linear scan pattern of the line scan mirrors 14 , 16 . a circuit 76 stores the line scans as inputted . however , during output the circuit 76 reverses the right - to - left scans so that the output is a series of consecutive left - to - right scan lines . an embodiment of elements comprising the circuit 76 is illustrated in fig5 and will be described in greater detail hereinbelow . the signal input from the circuit 76 is modified for tv formats with the left - to - right linear scan lines sequentially progressing via the field scan mirror 26 from the top to the bottom of the object field 11 . a circuit 78 adds appropriate timing and level information to the signal to formulate a standard composite tv format , which is slaved to the master clock input to the tv sync generator 80 . the output of the circuit 78 is then suitable to drive a standard tv display 82 . the tv sync generator 80 provides the timing for synchronizing the two line scan mirrors 14 , 16 and the field scan mirror 26 . the tunable resonant scanner 84 for the first line scan mirror 14 is frequency controlled and phase locked by the circuit networks 86 and 88 , respectively . for the embodiment herein described , the line scan rate of the resonant scanner 84 is one half of the normal tv line rate , i . e ., circuit 86 halves the frequency outputted by the tv sync generator 80 . the third harmonic in a fourier series for a triangular waveform is three times the frequency of the fundamental . therefore , a circuit 90 multiplies the output of the tv sync generator 80 by a factor of three . in a manner similar to the control used for the first line scan mirror 14 , the tunable resonant scanner 92 of the second line scan mirror 16 is frequency controlled and phase locked by the circuit networks 94 and 96 , respectively . the field scanner 98 for the field scan mirror 26 is controlled by the output from the tv sync generator 80 . the field scanner 98 is driven in an interlaced sawtooth pattern via a ramp generator 100 and a driver circuit 102 . for very high resolution applications it may be desirable to superimpose a high frequency oscillation or dither on the field scanner 98 via the field driver 102 to eliminate spurious information received from the edges of the object field 11 . it is a correction for the vertical displacement at the edges of the object field which result from the triangular left - to - right , right - to - left line scans as opposed to the true sawtooth left - to - right tv scan format . this small amplitude dither would be at twice the predetermined fundamental line scan frequency f f . the line storage and reversal circuit 76 performs two functions . it stores each pixel in each line so that each scan line can be read twice , and it reverses each right - to - left scan line . for the embodiment discussed hereinabove , each scan line must be read twice to compensate for a predetermined fundamental line scan frequency f f which is half of the standard tv line frequency . right - to - left line reversal is accomplished simply by reading the r / l ram 112 on a first - in , last - out basis . with reference to fig5 each pixel entering the line storage and reversal circuit 76 is digitized by an a / d converter 104 . the digitizing rate is set by a write counter 108 which is slaved to the fundamental line drive , that is at one half of the rate outputted from the tv sync generator 80 . the digitized output from the a / d converter 104 is directed to a l / r ram 114 by a switch 106 while the first line scan mirror 14 is scanning left - to - right and to the r / l ram 112 while the scanner is scanning right - to - left . the ram address for both rams is stepped by the write counter 108 through a switch 110 . the write counter 108 resets and the write counter switch 110 cycles at the scan line rate which is one half of the standard tv line rate . the read counter 118 steps both rams through a switch 116 for readout . the read counter 118 resets and the read counter switch 116 cycles at the standard tv line rate . the read output from the rams is directed to a d / a converter 122 by a switch 120 . while the fundamental line scan mirror 14 is scanning left - to - right the switch 120 is set to read the r / l ram 112 on a first - in , last - out basis . and conversely , while the first line scan mirror 14 is scanning right - to - left the switch 120 is set to read the l / r ram 114 on a first - in , first - out basis . the output from the d / a converter 122 is the input to the gate and summing circuit 78 . in the foregoing discussion the first line scan mirror 14 was frequency controlled by an external master clock . alternatively , radiation scanning systems according to the present invention can be operated at the inherent resonant frequency of the tunable resonant scanner . foreoptics can be used for applications requiring telescopic or microscopic magnifications . internal radiance references can be located at an intermediate focal plane when the system is used in applications requiring accurate measurements . a variety of modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings . it is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims , the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described hereinabove .",7
"with reference to fig1 , a height adjustable work seat 100 suitable for use by an automotive mechanic or other professional is shown . the height adjustable work seat has two major positions of operation , namely a full or maximum height and a very low or minimum height . at intermediate positions of operation , the height adjustable work seat is partially collapsed or partially extended . when working on an automobile , a mechanic may be standing , seated at a nominally conventional seating height , kneeling or sitting upon a floor , sitting or lying upon an automotive creeper or otherwise positioned so as to use tools and to access various regions at various heights of the automobile . traditionally , the mechanic uses the creeper only for accessing very low points of the automobile , and the creeper is either in the way or is moved out of the way while the mechanic works on intermediate or higher points of the automobile , bending or kneeling accordingly . the height adjustable work seat 100 allows the mechanic to select a very low or full height position of the seat , as needed for working on various regions of the automobile . as shown in fig1 , the base 102 of the height adjustable work seat 100 has four wheels 104 , which may have casters 106 , mounted at or near corners of the base 102 . in one example , the wheels 104 swivel with respect to the base 102 . various sizes of bases can , be devised . in the example shown in fig1 , the base 102 has first and second side sections 120 , 122 that extend past respective sides of the seat pan . the first and second side sections 120 , 122 extend further forward than the front edge 124 of the seat pan 112 , and extend further backward than the rear edge 126 of the seat pan 112 . the four wheels 104 are mounted accordingly , with the wheels being positioned outboard of the seat pan 112 for stability . in other words , the wheels 104 are positioned further fore and aft than the front to back extent of the seat pan 112 , and the wheels 104 are positioned further to the sides than the lateral extent of the seat pan 112 . with the wheels mounted further apart than the dimensions of the seat pan 112 , as when the base 102 including the side sections 120 , 122 is wider and deeper than the seat pan 112 and the wheels 104 are mounted near the outermost corners of the base 102 , the height adjustable work seat 100 exhibits stability both laterally and fore and aft . in one example , an upper surface 108 of the base may fit underneath the frame of the automobile , as when low - profile wheels such as found on a creeper are fitted to the frame . at the fully extended or maximum height position of the height adjustable work seat , the mechanic is comfortably seated at a nominal seating height and may roll the seat about the workspace until a very low height of the work seat is desired . in one embodiment , the upper surface 110 of the seat pan 112 , not including the seatback 114 , is approximately seventeen inches above a floor or other surface upon which the wheels 104 roll , when the height adjustable work seat 100 is at the maximum height position . further embodiments may have a seat pan 112 height of fourteen inches or other selected dimension above the floor . a mechanic , seated upon the height adjustable work seat in the maximum height position , can work upon the middle and upper regions of the front , sides and back of an automobile . at such time as a very low height of the work seat is desired , the mechanic collapses the work seat to the minimum height . with reference to fig2 , when the legs of the height adjustable work seat are folded and the work seat is collapsed to the minimum height , the seat pan is very low to the ground . in one example , the seat pan is approximately as low to the ground in the minimum height position as a bottom portion of a seat of the mechanics chair with side tray disclosed in u . s . pat . no . 7 , 237 , 781 . at the fully collapsed or minimum height position , the work seat is approximately as low to the ground as if a seat pan and seatback had been mounted to a mechanics creeper . the mechanic maneuvers the work seat in the minimum height position about the workspace to access lower regions of the automobile . in one embodiment , the upper surface of the seat pan , not including the seatback , is no more than twelve inches above a floor or other surface upon which the wheels roll , when the height adjustable work seat is at the minimum height position . in a further embodiment , a lowermost portion 202 of the top surface 110 of the seat pan 112 , not including the seat back 114 , is 6 inches above the floor when the height adjustable work seat is at the minimum height position . a mechanic , seated upon the height adjustable work seat in the minimum height position , can work upon the lowermost regions of the front , sides and back of an automobile . with reference to fig3 , the height adjustable work seat is shown with all four legs 302 , 304 , 306 and 308 partially collapsed or partially extended . seen from the front of the seat , the two front legs 302 and 304 collapse or fold towards each other , as do the two back legs 306 and 308 . the two front legs 302 and 304 fold along a front folding plane perpendicular to the floor , and the two back legs fold along a back folding plane perpendicular to the floor . seen from either side of the seat the legs of that side collapse or fold away from the viewer , towards the opposed side legs . in a variation , the legs of one side collapse or fold towards each other in a side folding plane , the legs of the opposing side likewise collapsing or folding towards each other in a further side folding plane . other leg - folding configurations may be devised by a person skilled in the art . further variations of the height adjustable work seat include various mechanisms for raising and lowering the seat . a scissors lift may be manually operated and have stops or ratchets at multiple positions . further , a scissors lift may be operated by a screw , using a handle or a motor drive . removable legs may be inserted into sockets in the base and the seat pan assembled onto the removable legs to raise the seat , with the legs removed for the lowered seat position . a seat may hang on upright rods or columns extending upward from a base , the seat being secured to the rods or columns at a variable height . a seat may spin on a large diameter screw that is threaded into the base , for height adjustment . sliding ramps may move inward or outward to adjust a height of the seat relative to the base . one , too , three or four legs may be included . with reference to fig4 , a placement of pivoting wheels 104 near the four outboard corners of the base 102 of the height adjustable work seat 100 is shown . each wheel rolls about a horizontal axis and each wheel assembly pivots about a vertical axis , in a manner known in the art . other arrangements of wheels , wheel types and mountings or placements of mountings may be devised . placing the wheels farther away from a vertical centerline or a center of gravity of the height adjustable work seat provides additional stability . with reference to fig5 , each leg 302 , 304 has a center pivot 316 or knee joint allowing the leg 302 to fold or pivot . each leg has a further pivot 318 at the top of the leg where the leg is pivotably connected to the seat pan or to a frame supporting the seat pan . each leg has a still further pivot 310 at the bottom of the leg where the leg is pivotably connected to the base . thus , each leg has three pivots , one each at top , center and bottom of the leg . equivalently , for each leg , the leg 302 has a lower leg 312 and an upper leg 314 . the bottom pivot 310 foldably connects the lower leg 312 to the base 102 . the center pivot 316 foldably connects the lower leg 312 to the upper leg 314 such that the lower leg 312 and the upper leg 314 can meet when folded together . the top pivot 318 foldably connects the upper leg 314 to the seat pan 112 or seat pan frame . in fig5 , the height adjustable work seat is shown with the two legs of one side partially collapsed or partially extended , and the two legs of the opposed side fully extended , although a view of the rear legs is obscured by the front legs in the elevated front view . in the example shown , the respective center pivots 316 of the front legs 302 , 304 fold towards each other , and the respective center pivots of the rear legs fold towards each other . with reference to fig5 , 6 and 8 , a sleeve lock 502 , 504 telescopically slides up or down an upper portion of each leg 302 , 304 , and locks the leg in a fully extended position or unlocks the leg . the sleeve lock may be a section of tubing of slightly larger inside dimensions than the outside dimensions of the upper leg section or the center pivot section , allowing for a sliding fit . the sleeve lock 502 , 504 slides over the center pivot 316 of the leg to lock the leg 302 , 304 , and slides off of the center pivot 316 of the leg to unlock the leg 302 , 304 . each sleeve lock 502 , 504 is a slidable locking sleeve on a respective leg , engaging and preventing the respective knee joint or other center pivot 316 from folding . each sleeve lock 502 , 504 is disengageable to enable folding the respective center pivot 316 . other mechanisms may be devised to lock a folding leg in a fully extended position and unlock the leg for folding . sleeve locks of the two legs belonging to one side of the seat may be connected by a crossbar 116 , as shown in fig1 , 3 , 4 and 8 . in one example , there are two crossbars 116 and 118 , a first crossbar 116 rigidly connecting sleeve locks of a first side of the chair and a second crossbar 118 rigidly connecting sleeve locks of a second side of the chair . in a further example , where the legs of the first side of the chair fold towards each other , a crossbar connects the sleeve locks of the front legs and a second crossbar connects the sleeve locks of the back legs . each crossbar is oriented perpendicular to the respective folding planes of the legs between which the crossbar spans . thus , a crossbar does not interfere with the folding of the legs that the sliding locks of the crossbar engage . in order to raise the height adjustable work seat from the minimum height as shown in fig2 to the full height as shown in fig1 , the mechanic releases any holding device that retains the work seat or chair in the minimum height position , then grasps and lifts the upper portion of the work seat e . g . by the seatback or seat pan . the upper portion of the work seat may be lifted and kept parallel with the floor with all four legs extending or unfolding simultaneously as shown in fig3 , or lifted by one side followed by the other side as shown in fig5 . as the upper portion of the work seat is lifted , the folding legs of one or both sides straighten out , and the center pivots or knee joints move outward from the folded , collapsed or stowed position to the extended or upright position . the mechanic may pull on the crossbars to assist the legs in opening . once the legs are fully extended , the mechanic pushes downward on the locking sleeves until each locking sleeve slides over the corresponding center pivot or knee joint , locking the center pivot or knee joint rigidly in place . as shown in fig8 , suitable protrusions or other stops 802 extending from a portion of each lower leg 804 serve to constrain each locking sleeve 808 , preventing the locking sleeve from sliding further downward on the leg 804 and unlocking the center pivot 806 or knee joint . the mechanic may push on each crossbar to assist the corresponding locking sleeves in sliding over the knee joints of the respective legs . other mechanisms may be devised for retaining the locking sleeve in a locked position at the center pivot , such as a spring - loaded ball on the locking sleeve engaging a detent on a portion of a leg or vice versa . in order to lower the height adjustable work seat from the full or maximum height as shown in fig1 to the minimum height as shown in fig2 , the raising procedure is reversed . the mechanic slides each locking sleeve upward , disengaging the locking sleeve from the corresponding center pivot or knee joint and allowing the respective leg to pivot at the center . the mechanic may pull on the crossbars to assist the corresponding locking sleeves in sliding off of the knee joints of the respective legs . next , the legs are collapsed . each leg may be folded in half , one at a time , or pairs of legs on a side or pairs of legs at a front or a back may be collapsed together , or all four legs may be folded at the same time . the mechanic may press on one or both crossbars to assist the corresponding legs in folding . once the legs are fully collapsed , the mechanic may use the work seat in the minimum height position . in a variation , once the legs are fully collapsed , a holding device such as a latch , a pin or a hook is engaged that retains the work seat or chair in the minimum height position . with reference to fig6 , an example of a knee joint 604 is shown , with the locking sleeve 602 in - place and rigidly securing the knee joint 604 in an open or fully extended position . in the example , the knee joint 604 has a center link 606 or plate with two pivots 608 and 610 , a first pivot 608 pivotally connecting the center link 606 to the upper leg 612 , and a second pivot 610 pivotally connecting the center link 606 to the lower leg 614 . the locking sleeve 602 may completely surround the knee joint 604 when the knee joint is in the fully extended position . with reference to fig7 , variations of the knee joint may be devised . the knee joint may have a center link or one or more side plates or links . in one variation , the knee joint 702 has two side plates or links 704 and 706 flanking respective linking projections 708 and 710 from the lower leg 712 and the upper leg 714 . in order for the side plate or plates to be recessed and allow sliding clearance for a close - fitting locking sleeve , corresponding ends of the folding legs that join at a knee joint may be thinned or have recesses 716 fitting the plates . with reference to fig8 , the extended knee joint is shown rotated by one quarter of a turn about a vertical axis from the view as shown in fig6 . the locking sleeve 808 slides upward 810 or downward 814 along the upper leg 816 to unlock or lock the center pivot 806 or knee joint . one or more of the locking sleeves may be secured in a locked or an unlocked position . a securing device , such as a pin through a hole in the locking sleeve and engaging a hole in an upper leg or in a knee joint plate , fixes the locking sleeve in a selected location . in a variation , the securing device may be a bolt 818 through a threaded hole 820 in the locking sleeve 808 , the bolt being tightened to a friction fit on the upper leg , on the knee joint plate or elsewhere . the pin or bolt may have a knob or other easily grasped head 822 . in a still further variation the securing device may be a bolt through a threaded hole in the locking sleeve and engaging a hole in an upper leg or in a knee joint plate or elsewhere . in one example all four locking sleeves have bolts . other mechanisms for holding each locking sleeve in place with the corresponding leg in a locked or an unlocked position may be devised . with reference to fig9 , the base 902 of the height adjustable work seat may have one or more side trays 904 , tool trays 906 or beverage holders 908 to one or both sides of the mountings for the legs of the seat . a tray or trays may be fixed or removable . a tray may be mounted to or integral with the base or extensions thereof . tools or other working materials , or a beverage for the mechanic , may be placed or stored in the side tray without interfering with the folding mechanism for the legs of the seat . further , with tools so positioned , a mechanic may reach down to grasp a tool rather than having to fumble underneath the seat as when tools are stored in an under - seat tray . with reference to fig1 and 11 , various seating devices may be attached to or otherwise incorporated into the height adjustable work seat . a seat pan 1000 and seatback 1100 provide a comfortable sitting arrangement for a mechanic . the seatback 1100 may be a half - height seatback . in a further example , a seat pan 1000 without a seatback may be fitted to the height adjustable work seat , which then functions as a height adjustable stool . a seat may be formed of a seat pan 1000 as shown in fig1 or a seat pan 112 and integrated seatback 114 , which may be a half - height seatback , as shown in fig1 - 4 . in a still further example , a tray or a platform is fitted in place of the seat pan and seatback , and the height adjustable work seat functions as a height adjustable work tray , a height adjustable platform or a height adjustable seat and tray combination .",0
"a probe 10 for use underwater to measure true acoustic intensity is shown generally in fig1 and 2 . the outer casing of probe 10 is preferably made neutrally buoyant , such that wave vibrations affect the probe casing 14 just as they would affect the water which probe 10 displaces . probe casing 14 may include a syntactic foam casting 12 . the cured foam can be used , trimmed or weighted to achieve neutral buoyancy , as needed . while it is preferred that the outer casing be made neutrally buoyant , embodiments of the present invention may be made without a neutrally buoyant outer casing . a compliance layer 16 separates the probe outer casing 14 from a “ coupling - mass ” or secondary casing 18 . the compliance layer may take a variety of forms , and in this embodiment is a thin layer of compliant rubber , such as a silicon rubber . a plurality of sensor elements 20 and 22 are disposed between the inner surface of the “ coupling - mass ” or secondary casing 18 and a central mounting structure or support 24 . in this embodiment , the sensor elements are small piezoelectric wafers 20 and 22 mounted between the “ coupling - mass ” or secondary casing 18 and the support 24 . the probe or sensor 10 is designed to be mounted to a rigid or semi rigid mounting structure such as support 24 . the outer surface of the support 24 or the entire support 24 may be considered an inner sensor support , or a different sensor support may be provided . in the embodiment of fig1 and 2 , casting 12 is a rigid syntactic foam material having a density less than that of water and strong enough to withstand high hydrostatic pressure . an appropriate amount of foam is used to allow the casting 12 and the and the rest of the probe casing 14 to have the same mass as the volume of water displaced by the entire probe 10 . the cured foam can be trimmed or weighted to achieve neutral buoyancy . acoustic pressures act to displace the casting 12 and the remainder of the probe casing 14 with the same magnitude and phase of the acoustic particle displacement . motion of the probe casing 14 results in spring - like forces in the compliant rubber 16 which are directly applied to the “ coupling - mass ” or secondary casing 18 . the forces generated at the casing 18 are imparted to the piezoelectric elements 20 and 22 . the piezoelectric sensors 20 and 22 are preferably smaller than the inner surface of the secondary casing 18 . effectively , the entire acoustic pressure exerted on the casting 12 and probe casing 14 are coupled into the smaller area of the piezoelectric elements 20 for frequencies much higher than the resonance exhibited by the compliant rubber layer 16 , the probe casing 14 , and the “ coupling - mass ” or secondary casing 18 . in this embodiment , piezoelectric elements 20 are poled in a 3 - 3 mode , while the elements 22 are poled in a 1 - 5 mode for a response to shear . the electrical signal generated by the piezoelectric elements 20 and 22 correspond to the magnitude and frequency of the sensed vibration . this voltage output is directly proportional to the neutrally buoyant probe casing &# 39 ; s velocity which , in turn , is substantially the same as that of the surrounding water . one novel feature of this invention is the suspension method used to fix the time - average location of the probe . inertial - type probes of the prior art typically involve suspensions of the outer casing which must be allowed to move in concert with the acoustic wave vibrations . generally , any suspension system will limit the response of at least one degree of freedom , if not more . however , the invention treats this probe as a pair of coupled masses , comprising the outer casing 14 and the “ coupling - mass ” casing 18 , with the outer casing 14 mass being negligible due to the buoyancy corrections made by the syntactic foam 12 . it can then easily be shown that above the resonance frequency of the combined system of the compliant layer 16 , the probe casing 14 , and the inner casing 18 , there is essentially no motion of the inner casing 18 . the present invention can exploit this fact by rigidly mounting the probe by the central support 24 . this fixes the time - average location of the probe while having in essence no effect on the probe &# 39 ; s response . since the neutrally buoyant outer casing moves in concert with the acoustically induced motion of water , the probe can be made small relative to the wavelength of the acoustic field . while the overall package of the intensity probe can be made much smaller than that of a prior art inertial - type probes , the non - zero length of the probe still introduces an error in the velocity measurement . it is probably not practical to make the probe smaller than about 1 . 5 cm , but this would still permit operation up to 25 , 000 hz before acoustic scattering becomes significant . in one embodiment of the invention , the syntactic foam casting 12 is a mixture of epoxy resin and glass microballoons . as shown in fig2 , the assembly of rectangular components is centered within a rectangular - shaped casting 12 . pressure sensors 28 and 30 are mounted on the edge of the casting 12 , a portion of each pressure sensor 28 and 30 being directly exposed to the surrounded water and the small gap 32 is sealed with a compliant , waterproof material . pressure hydrophones 28 and 30 can be cast into the end faces of the outer casing 14 , or cemented on casting 12 after the foam has cured . an air - backed piezoceramic bender disk is an example of the type of hydrophone which can be used in probe 10 . in use , the probe 10 can be directly mounted to an external support structure via the central support rod 24 at a desired elevational measurement point and oriented in a desired measurement direction . voltage outputs from the piezoelectric elements 20 are directly proportional to acoustic particle velocity in the plane normal to the support rod 24 while the voltage output from the piezoelectric elements 22 is proportional to the acoustic particle velocity in the direction parallel to the support rod 24 . alternatively , the voltage outputs from the pressure sensors 28 and 30 can be used to approximate the acoustic particle velocity in the direction parallel to the support rod 24 according to the equations given above . combinations of the various signal output of the probe by those skilled in the art yield accurate measurements of the complete vector field of the acoustic intensity . this embodiment provides a probe which is compact , light in weight , easy to handle out of water , and adapts well to a variety of support structures . also , multiple units could be combined along the same support rod 24 to create an array of probes 10 . additionally , the potentially small size can greatly reduce the effect of acoustic field scattering . a second embodiment is shown in fig3 and 4 , in which the probe 10 consists of a plurality of cylindrical layers , rather than square - shaped as indicated in fig1 and 2 . this embodiment is constructed in a similar manner and exhibits roughly the same properties as the first embodiment . the same reference numbers are used for corresponding elements . the outer casing 14 can be more easily adapted to an acoustic pressure means by simply using a piezoelectric cylinder of appropriate dimensions . also , the cylindrical profile further reduces acoustic scattering of the field . a third embodiment is shown in fig5 and 6 , in which the probe 11 consists of a plurality of spherical layers , rather than cylindrical as describe above . in this embodiment , the foam casing 13 encloses a thin walled piezoelectric sphere 15 . this in turn encloses a thin layer of compliant rubber 17 and a smaller “ coupling - mass ” sphere 19 to which are bonded a plurality of six small piezoelectric wafers 21 and a central rigid sphere - rod assembly 25 . the piezoelectric wafers 21 are positioned in pairs along orthogonal cartesian axes such that the average location of the pairs is co - located at the center of the probe 11 . the rigid sphere - and - rod support 25 is oriented such that it emerges from the probe 11 at an angle of forty - five degrees with respect to the axes established by the piezoelectric element 21 pairs so as not to interfere with location of the piezoelectric elements 21 . signals incident on probe 11 will cause motion of the casting 13 and piezoelectric shell or casing 15 . the acoustic pressure of the incident wave is directly measured by the piezoelectric shell 15 . the acoustic forces on the sphere are coupled into the piezoelectric elements 21 identically as described in the first embodiment . however , in this third embodiment , the outer casing 15 is free to move in three - dimensions , i . e . there is no restriction on its motion due to the support provided by the central sphere - and - rod support 25 . the piezoelectric elements 25 are electrically connected in pairs such that each pair outputs a voltage proportional to the acoustic particle acceleration in the direction along the separation vector between them , but produces no output for compressional forces on the element pairs . thus , the probe 11 directly measures the acoustic pressure and the acoustic particle acceleration in three orthogonal directions . a pressure signal from sensor 15 and the appropriate velocity signal from piezoelectric elements 21 are combined to provide the true acoustic intensity . further , a fourth embodiment of the probe 50 is shown in fig7 and 8 , in which the compliant layer 58 and the piezoelectric elements 60 and 62 are reversed as compared to the previously noted embodiments . in this embodiment , neutral buoyancy requires the displaced water mass to be equal to the combined mass of the casting 52 , the outer casing 54 , the “ coupler mass ” casing 56 and the elements 60 and 62 , in order that rigidly mounting the center support has no effect on the sensor response . other details are consistent with previously detailed embodiment descriptions noted above , for example 1 - 5 shear piezoelectric elements 62 may be removed and two hydrophones 68 and 70 may be used to approximate the velocity parallel to the central support . any gaps 72 should be sealed with a highly compliant material . the voltage output of the piezoelectric elements 60 and 62 are directly proportional to the three dimensional acoustic particle acceleration , rather than particle velocity . the output voltage signals can be electrically corrected to be proportional to the particle velocity and then combined with the acoustic pressure signal to compute acoustic intensity of the field . in this configuration , the probe has a slightly higher response to acoustic excitation as compared to above the detailed embodiments . various modifications can be made to the embodiments described herein . for example , the use of syntactic foam is required solely for balancing buoyant forces on the probe and may or may not be necessary in some embodiments of a probe . any rigid material is suitable as a casting or housing around the velocity sensor provided the density of the sensor is the same as the fluid in which measurements are to be made . alternatively , the sensor can be made more or less dense than the fluid it displaces , and a sensor transfer function can be determined and taken into account in acoustic intensity calculations . this can be accomplished by calibrating the output of the sensor to a known acoustic velocity field , such as a plane progressive wave . also , probe 10 , 11 or 50 can produce pressure and velocity signals to be recorded separately for later processing . alternatively , simple electronic circuitry ( not shown ) could be cast into castings 12 , 13 or 52 , or contained within the rigid support rod 24 , 25 or 64 , so that acoustic intensity can be calculated within probe 10 , 11 or 50 . another alternative is to connect the signal output leads to an external device ( i . e . digital signal analyzer ) to calculate acoustic intensity . as will be clear to those of skill in the art , other modifications may also be made . as mentioned previously , the layer of compliant material in the described embodiments may be replaced with other compliance layers . the illustrated layer of compliant silicon rubber is continuous and completely encases the secondary casing or inner support . alternatively , there can be gaps in the layer , or springs or other compliance elements may be used to form the compliance layer . when silicon rubber is used , it is preferred that it be highly compliant , especially in comparison to the generally rigid outer and secondary casings . in some embodiments , the compliant material has a shore a hardness less than 50 , while other embodiments have a hardness less than 30 , and still other have a compliance less than 20 . one version has a hardness of approximately 10 . as will be clear to those of skill in the art , a similar effective compliance may be obtained with harder materials if voids are provided , or through other approaches . in some embodiments , the compliance layer has a thickness of 2 -

"fig1 is a cross - sectional view illustrating a method for fabricating a mos transistor according to one embodiment of the invention . fig2 through 5 are graphs illustrating changes in the concentration of dopants in a junction of a mos transistor fabricated in accordance with a method of the invention . with reference to fig1 , a gate insulating layer pattern 130 , a gate conductive layer pattern 140 , and a gate hardmask layer pattern 150 are sequentially formed on a semiconductor substrate 100 ( e . g ., a silicon substrate ) to form a gate stack . gate spacers 160 are formed on sidewalls of the gate stack . impurity ions are implanted into exposed portions of the semiconductor substrate 100 by a common ion implantation process to form a source region 121 and a drain region 122 . a channel region 110 is defined to a region between the source region 121 and the drain region 122 . in order to form junctions of a lightly doped drain ( ldd ) structure ( not shown ), the impurity ions may be implanted at a relatively low concentration to form source / drain extension regions ( not shown ) before the formation of the gate spacer 160 . further , a well region of a conductivity type opposite to that of the source and drain regions 121 and 122 may be formed in an upper region of the semiconductor substrate 100 before the formation of the gate stack . as indicated by the arrows 170 in fig1 , hydrogen is implanted to reduce the concentration of the dopants in a particular portion of the interface ( i . e . a source junction ) between the source region 121 and the channel region 110 , and in a particular portion of the interface ( i . e . a drain junction ) between the drain region 122 and the channel region 110 . in the case where the mos transistor is a p - channel mos transistor , boron ( b ) ions or bf 2 ions at a high concentration are implanted into the source region 121 and the drain region 122 . when hydrogen is implanted into the source and drain junctions by hydrogen implantation , the hydrogen serves to neutralize the b ions or bf 2 ions present in particular portions of the source and drain junctions , resulting in a reduction in the concentration of the b ions or bf 2 ions in the particular portions . fig2 shows the concentration distribution of dopants ( b ions ) implanted at a high concentration after the formation of the source region 121 and drain region 122 . from the graph of fig2 , it is apparent that the b ions are present at the highest concentration around the surface of the junction , i . e . at the left end of the x - axis of the graph , and that the concentration of the b ions decreases with increasing depth of the junction ( i . e . as the x - axis value increases ) ( see , the line denoted by reference numeral “ 200 ” in fig2 ). referring to fig3 , when hydrogen is implanted to a particular target depth , e . g ., a depth of about 400 å from the surface , the concentration of the hydrogen is the highest at a depth of about 400 å and gradually decreases with increasing and decreasing depth . the implanted hydrogen serves to neutralize the b ions . as shown in fig4 , the b ions are neutralized in the particular portion ( see , the portion “ a ” shown in fig4 ) around a depth of about 400 å , resulting in a reduction in the concentration of the b ions . only a few changes in the concentration of the b ions are observed in the other portions . the graphs of fig2 to 4 show the results measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ), while the graph of fig5 shows the results measured by spreading resistance profiling ( srp ). fig5 reveals that the concentration of the dopants activated by hydrogen implantation is reduced at a depth of about 400 å ( see , the portion “ b ” shown in the figure ). the reduction of the concentration of the dopants in the particular portion by hydrogen implantation enables inhibition of short - channel effects without substantially affecting the concentration of the dopants in the other portions , i . e . while minimizing deterioration of the current driving ability of the device . in addition , the reduction of the concentration of the dopants in the particular portion enables increase of punchthrough margin and improvement of leakage current characteristics in the particular portion . the particular portion where the concentration of the dopants is decreased may be determined through various simulation experiments . once the particular portion is determined , the particular portion where the concentration of the dopants is decreased can be controlled by varying the energy required for the hydrogen implantation . in addition , the amount of the dopants to be neutralized can be controlled by varying the dose of the hydrogen implanted . for example , when it is intended to achieve increased punchthrough margin and improved leakage current characteristics in a deep portion of a junction , a target for hydrogen implantation is set in a lower portion of the junction and the concentration of dopants to be activated in the lower portion of the junction is decreased . similarly , when it is intended to achieve increased punchthrough margin and improved leakage current characteristics at the surface of a junction , a target for hydrogen implantation is set in an upper portion of the junction and the concentration of dopants to be activated in the upper portion of the junction is decreased . fig6 and 7 are graphs comparing changes in the concentration of dopants in a junction of a mos transistor to which halo ion implantation is applied , with changes in the concentration of dopants in a junction of a mos transistor fabricated in accordance with the method of the invention . fig6 shows changes in the concentration of dopants in a junction of a mos transistor to which halo ion implantation is applied . the line denoted by reference numeral “ 610 ” represents changes in the concentration of dopants of a first conductivity type in source / drain regions , and the line denoted by reference numeral “ 620 ” represents changes in the concentration of dopants of a second conductivity type implanted by halo ion implantation . “ c ” and “ d ” shown in the figure indicate changes in the concentration of the dopants of a first conductivity type , particularly the concentration of the dopants activated . fig7 shows changes in the concentration of dopants in a junction of a mos transistor fabricated by hydrogen implantation in accordance with the method of the invention . the line denoted by reference numeral “ 710 ” represents changes in the concentration of dopants of a first conductivity type in the source / drain regions 121 / 122 , and the line denoted by reference numeral “ 720 ” represents changes in the concentration of hydrogen implanted by hydrogen implantation . “ e ” shown in the figure indicates changes in the concentration of the dopants of a first conductivity type activated only in a particular portion , that is , around a target depth into which the hydrogen is implanted . fig7 also shows that few changes in the concentration of the dopants activated are observed in the other portions . fig8 is a cross - sectional view illustrating a method for fabricating a mos transistor according to another embodiment of the invention . referring to fig8 , hydrogen is fed into junctions by hydrogen annealing in the method of this embodiment , which is distinguished from the method of the previous embodiment by hydrogen implantation . according to the method of this embodiment , an mos transistor is fabricated by the following procedure . first , a semiconductor substrate 100 is loaded into a furnace 810 . as explained with respect to fig1 , a gate stack is formed on the semiconductor substrate 100 and ion implantation is performed to form a source region 121 and a drain region 122 . before or after the formation of the gate stack , the source region 121 and the drain region 122 , hydrogen is fed into the furnace 800 to create a hydrogen ambient , as indicated by the arrows 810 in fig8 . then , annealing is performed at above a predetermined temperature such that the hydrogen is fed into particular portions of junctions of the source / drain regions . the annealing may be performed by a common heat treatment process . if needed , the annealing may be performed by rapid thermal processing ( rtp ). regardless of which process is employed , the particular portions of the junctions of the source / drain regions and the amount of the dopants to be neutralized can be controlled by varying the internal temperature of the furnace 800 and the amount of the hydrogen fed .",7

"preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawing ( fig4 to 6 ). fig4 shows a mos transistor 10 according to the first embodiment of the present invention and a protective element 11 . the mos transistor 10 is comprised of a gate electrode 5 a , heavily - doped n - type diffusion regions 3 a and 3 b , probe pads 7 a , 7 b , and 7 c , and the like , and has a structure similar to that of the prior art shown in fig1 . the protective element 11 is connected to the gate electrode pad 7 a . the structure of this protective element 11 will be described below . the protective element 11 has a gate electrode 5 b and heavily - doped n - type diffusion regions 3 b and 3 c formed adjacent to the gate electrode 5 b . the gate electrode 5 b is connected to a pad 8 through a contact 6 . the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b is connected to the gate pad 7 a of the mos transistor 10 . the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 c is connected to a heavily - doped p - type diffusion region 4 , which is formed away from the region 3 c , through an interconnection 9 b . the gate electrode 5 a of the mos transistor 10 is connected to the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b of the protective element 11 through an interconnection 9 . the charge built up on the pad 7 a in a plasma process or the like flows into the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b of the protective element 11 through the interconnection 9 . this increases the potential of the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b . at the same time , charge builds up on the pad 8 for the gate electrode 5 b of the protective element 11 in the same manner , and its potential increases . as a result , the protective element 11 is turned on . when plasma etching for interconnections is performed , charge build up on the gate pad 7 a of the mos transistor 10 and the gate pad 8 of the protective element 11 to almost the same level because the pads have the same size . for this reason , the potentials of the respective pads become almost equal . the potentials at this time are generally several volts or higher . on the other hand , since the threshold voltage of the protective element 11 is generally one volt or lower , the channel of the protective element 11 is turned on when charge builds up on the pad 8 . in addition , the potential of the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b connected to the pad 7 a becomes higher than that of the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 c by several volts or higher . for this reason , current conducts between the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b of the protective element 11 and the heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 c . the charge built upon on the gate electrode 5 a of the mos transistor 10 flows into the p - type substrate 1 through the channel of the protective element 11 and the heavily - doped p - type diffusion region 4 . according to the characteristics obtained when the channel of the protective element 11 is turned on , as shown in fig5 the channel current abruptly increases with an increase in gate voltage . that is , the protective element 11 behaves like a resistor connected to the p - type substrate 1 , and the charge flowing into the gate electrode pad 7 a of the protective element 11 flows into the substrate according to the characteristics indicated by “( a )” in fig5 . note that the current flowing from the plasma and the gate voltage have a predetermined relationship , which is indicated as a plasma current ( dotted line ) in fig5 . the plasma current does not have much dependence on the gate current and can be approximately regarded as a constant current . that is , charging by the plasma can be prevented by forming a path through which the current escapes . in this manner , charge buildup on the gate electrode of the mos transistor 10 is prevented , thereby preventing damage to the gate oxide film . in measuring the characteristics of the mos transistor after completion of the manufacturing process , since the channel of the protective element 11 is turned off when the potential of the pad 8 of the protective element 11 is set to be equal to that of the p - type substrate 1 , the gate electrode 5 a of the mos transistor 10 is connected to only the diode ( heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 b ). measurement can therefore be performed without any problem . in addition , since charge builds up on the gate electrode 5 b of the protective element 11 by the plasma , like the gate electrode 5 a of the mos transistor 10 , the gate insulating film of the protective element 11 may be damaged . to prevent this , it is preferable to increase the channel width and channel length of the protective element 11 and to decrease the antenna ratio . in addition , when the threshold voltage of the protective element 11 is set to be lower than that of the mos transistor 10 , the protective element 11 can be easily turned on . this improves the protective effect . the second embodiment of the present invention will be described next with reference to fig6 . if the amount of charge flowing from a plasma is excessively large , the gate insulating film of the protective element 11 may be damaged and destroyed . in such a case , no protective effect can be expected . for this reason , protection by a diode is added to reduce the plasma damage to the protective element 11 itself . fig6 is a plan view of a mos transistor according to the second embodiment . the second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that an interconnection 9 d is connected to a pad 8 for a gate electrode 5 b of a protective element 11 , and a pad 8 is connected to a heavily - doped n - type diffusion region 3 d through the interconnection 9 d . a diode d is therefore formed by the protective element 11 . when charge builds up on the gate electrode 5 b of the protective element 11 , the diode d breaks down to allow the charge in the gate electrode 5 b to escape into the p - type substrate 1 . even if the diode is added to the protective element 11 in this manner , the characteristics of the element do not change , and hence the same protection performance as that in the first embodiment can be expected , as indicated by “( a )” in fig5 . in the second embodiment , the mos transistor is described as an estimation transistor . however , the present invention is not limited to this . even in general mos transistors used in integrated circuits , when long interconnections are connected to gate electrodes , the same problem concerning charge buildup as that described above arises . therefore , the influences of charge buildup can be prevented by applying the present invention to such circuits .",7
"this invention proposes the design of a central tower receiver using molten salts with a defined configuration , which facilitates its functioning and control during the operation of the thermoelectric solar plant . the main advantage of the design which is the object of this invention is that its implementation allows the useful life of the receiver to be increased and a decrease in the differences in temperature between the feed entrance and exit in the pipes which the receiver is composed of . as a consequence , there would be a reduction in the thermal tensions experienced by the material which can result in structural damage , such as fractures and cracks , mainly in the welded areas . to achieve this , a system is proposed involving recirculation of a percentage of the exit flow of the receiver ( mixture of hot molten salts ) upon their entrance . this flow percentage must result in the lowest possible load loss , generating at the same time admissible thermal losses for a fixed level of receiver efficiency . the receiver proposed in this invention , in order to reduce thermal losses , will be of a cavity type . cavity type receivers are defined as those which are installed at the top of a tower inside a gap or cavity , in order to minimize thermal losses due to radiation or convection . the configuration is in a semi cylindrical shape composed of panels , the receiver area is determined according to the thermal power of the design . the panels are formed of a combination of vertical pipes . the semi cylindrical shape of the receiver allows the maximization of the capture of solar radiation by the heliostat field . the cold molten salt ( heat transfer fluid ), originating from the storage tank , is not directly introduced into the receiver , as occurs in state - of - the - art systems , but supplies a mixture deposit which collects cold salt as well as a part of the hot recirculating salt mixing them together in the deposit , so that afterwards said mixture , of cold and hot molten salts , is introduced in the upper part of the vertical pipes which the receiver consists of . on the lower part , the hot salt is collected . part of the exit flow of this hot salt ( this proportion is defined for reasons of recirculation ) is recirculated in the mixture deposit and the rest is carried to the hot salt storage tank . the heating of the salt mixture is produced as the fluid advances through the interior of the combination of vertical pipes in the panels , absorbing the incident solar radiation on the surface . the configuration of the panels which the receiver consists of is in parallel . the distribution of the entrance fluid ( mixture of cold and hot molten salts ) within the panels is carried out using control valves on the upper part . the distribution of the flow of fluid is based on the incident solar radiation power in the panels ( distribution of non uniform incident flow over time ). as a result , in the panels which receive greater incident radiant power , a greater flow of refrigeration will circulate , in this way ensuring that the gradients in the pipe walls of the receivers are at a minimum during their operation . the recirculation of a part of the exit flow of the receiver ( hot molten salt ) at its entrance allows , as previously mentioned , reductions in the temperature variations between the entrance and the exit of the vertical pipes of the panels of which the receiver consists of and , as a consequence , reductions in the thermal dilations of the materials from which the pipes are manufactured . however , as the recirculation percentage increases , not only is there an increase in the difference in temperatures between the entrance and the exit of the vertical tubes that the receiver is composed of , but the load losses in the system increase , so that greater impulsion power of the working fluid is required . furthermore , the temperature of the metal in the surface of the receiver is greater , resulting in greater thermal losses , mainly due to radiation . as a result , a suitable selection with regards to optimal recirculation for established design power will lead to optimal functioning of the receiver . the proposed configuration of the molten salt receiver ( system with recirculation ) minimizes the technological risks which are present in other receivers , in those which the thermal cycles which the material must bear are stronger and , as a result , have a greater impact on the material . this device must offer solutions to some of the problems detected that exist in molten salt receiver technology and provide advantages in its use , such as the reduction in the risk of damage to the structure and the material of the receiver ; and increase the efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle with respect to that currently obtained with saturated and / or overheated steam receivers , thanks to which greater working temperatures are reached . to complete the description that is being made and with the object of assisting in a better understanding of the characteristics of the invention , accompanying said description is a set of drawings wherein , by way of illustration and not restrictively , the following has been represented : fig1 . configuration of a molten salt receiver formed by a panel with a recirculation system . fig2 . configuration of a molten salt receiver formed by four panels with a recirculation system . fig3 . geometry of a molten salt receiver formed by four panels . a list is provided below with the references used in the figures : ( 1 ) entrance flow to the receiver ( 2 ) exit flow from the receiver ( 3 ) entrance flow to the hot salt storage tank ( 4 ) recirculation flow of hot salt ( 5 ) entrance flow of cold salt to the mixer ( 6 ) mixer ( flows 4 and 5 ) ( 7 ) impulsion pump of the molten salt mixture ( 8 ) cold molten salt storage tank ( 9 ) hot molten salt storage tank ( 10 ) receiver panel formed by vertical pipes ( 11 ) panel 2 e ( east ) of the receiver ( 12 ) panel 1 e ( east ) of the receiver ( 13 ) panel 1 w ( west ) of the receiver ( 14 ) panel 2 w ( west ) of the receiver ( 15 ) control valve for the flow distribution of panel 2 e ( 16 ) control valve for the flow distribution of panel 1 e ( 17 ) control valve for the flow distribution of panel 1 w ( 18 ) control valve for the flow distribution of panel 2 w ( 19 ) focus point of the heliostat field to achieve a better understanding of the invention , there is a description below of the system and operation of a central tower receiver system using molten salts . as observed in fig1 , the molten salt receiver ( 10 ) is formed by a panel composed of vertical pipes . the cold molten salt ( 5 ), originating from the tank in which it is stored ( 8 ), is carried to supply a mixture deposit ( 6 ) where , by way of a supply line , hot molten salts ( 4 ) also arrive , so that the exit flow from the mixer ( 6 ) enters the upper part of the vertical pipes of which the receiver is composed of ( 10 ). on the lower part of said pipes , the hot salt is collected ( 2 ). part of the exit flow ( 2 ) ( the quantity being defined for reasons of recirculation which are established ) recirculates ( 4 ) to the mixture deposit ( 6 ) and the rest ( 3 ) is carried to the hot salt storage tank ( 9 ). the heating of the mixture of cold and hot salts ( 1 ) entering the receiver ( 10 ) is produced as the fluid advances through the interior of the combination of vertical pipes in the panels , absorbing the incident solar radiation on the surface . shown in the configuration of the four panel receiver ( fig2 ) is the circulation circuit of the working fluid in parallel through the panels and the flow of recirculation ( 4 ) from the exit ( 2 ) to the entrance ( 1 ) of the receiver . each panel ( 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 ) is composed of a combination of vertical pipes . the circulation of the fluid inside the receiver is identical to that described for fig1 . as observed in fig3 , the molten salt receiver is formed by four panels ( 11 , 12 , 13 and 14 ) with a semi cylindrical disposition . this configuration manages to collect all the solar energy reflected by the heliostat field which is directed at the focus point ( 19 ). the heat transfer fluid used in a preferred embodiment is a mixture of molten nitrate salts ; a preferred composition would be formed by 60 % of nano 3 and 40 % of kno 3 .",8
"in accordance with the process , heavy crude oil is first heated and then pumped through a permeable ceramic membrane unit at high differential pressure using a cross - flow arrangement . useful conditions are as follows : feed temperature : 90 ° c . to boiling temperature of the oil or upper limit of membrane capability differential pressure : 40 psig to maximum allowable differential pressure of the membrane feed flow rate : depends on total surface area of the membrane unit and will be about 1 - 10 liters / hr . per m 2 of available membrane surface membrane capabilities : operable at trans - membrane pressure of 1450 psig and temperature up to 480 ° c . the experiments underlying the invention were carried out in the batch ultrafiltration unit shown schematically in fig1 . the unit included a membrane module 1 shown in fig2 and comprising a 5 . 08 cm o . d .× 1 . 9 cm i . d . tubular steel housing 2 containing a 25 cm long × 1 cm o . d . single tube ceramic membrane element 3 . the membrane elements used were obtained from united states filter corporation of warrendale , pa . and are identified by the trade mark membralox . the membrane elements were single tube asymmetric ceramic membranes composed of alumina . each element comprised layered composites , with the outer layer having the smallest pores . the membrane element 3 was inwardly spaced from the housing wall to form an annulus 4 . the open ends of the annulus and housing were closed by ferrules 5 carrying o - ring 6 , o - ring 7 and end plates 8 , 9 . the end plate 8 formed an inlet 10 for feed and the end plate 9 formed an outlet 11 for retentate . the housing side wall 12 formed an outlet 13 for the permeate and an outlet 14 for collecting a permeate sample or draining the permeate side of the module . a first reservoir tank 18 , containing heavy crude oil feed , was equipped with a stirrer 33 and was externally heated by an electrical heating band 32 . the heavy crude oil feed was delivered through valve 19 to the feed pump 20 and pumped to the internal retentate recycle line 35 through the filter 21 using line 22 . a second reservoir tank 15 , containing toluene , was also connected to the feed pump through valve 16 and shut - off valve 17 . the heavy oil feed and the internal retentate recycle were pumped through the membrane tube at high velocity using the recycle pump 23 . the internal retentate recycle rate was monitored using flowmeter 34 . during normal operation shut - off valve 29 was closed and the retentate was mostly recycled through line 35 to ensure a high cross - flow velocity in the membrane tube . a small portion of the retentate also flowed through the relief valve 30 that was used to control the pressure in the membrane . the permeate flowed through valve 25 , filter 26 , flowmeter 27 , valve 28 and was recovered at point p of fig1 . in addition , a permeate sample could be withdrawn through valve 24 . during the initial part of the operation , permeate was recycled to the feed tank by switching valve 28 so that the permeate was returned to the reservoir tank through line 36 and valve 31 . once the permeate asphaltene content was at the desired level , valve 28 was switched so that permeate was recovered at point p . in the operation of the unit , heavy oil was heated in tank 18 and the membrane unit filled with this oil within 1 minute using the feed pump 20 . the unit was purged of trapped air by opening valve 29 . subsequently valve 29 was closed and the recycle pump 23 was started . the relief valve 30 was then adjusted to obtain the desired pressure in the membrane tube . valve 25 was opened and valve 28 was switched so that permeate was directed through line 36 back to the feed tank . permeate samples were also withdrawn through valve 24 . once the initial permeate recycle period was complete , valve 28 was switched such that the permeate flow exited at point p . most comparisons made in the tables are based on initial flux . that is , for the case of no permeate recycle initial flux is the flux measured as soon as the membrane unit has reached steady state ( about 20 minutes ) and for the case of permeate recycle the flux is that flux measured after about 3 hours once the permeate recycle has been stopped . as shown in fig1 permeate can be recycled to the front end of the membrane unit . recycling is commenced when a non - fouled membrane is placed in operation and is continued until there is a sharp change in diminution of flux rate . at about this point , ( identified by the numeral 100 in fig3 ), recycling is terminated while ultrafiltration is continued . intermittent back - pulsing can be practised by backflowing permeate through the membrane wall to clear the gel layer when it accumulates . a small amount (& lt ; 10 wt . %) of a diluent , such as benzene or toluene , can be added to the feed to reduce viscosity , if desired . this example compares the results obtained in the first stage of the operation , each conducted under the same conditions with the exception that in one run no permeate was recycled and in the other run all of the permeate was recycled for a preliminary period of 3 hours . the membrane used had an average pore diameter of ˜ 1000 ° a . table i______________________________________feed temperature : 120 ° c . inlet pressure : 97 psigfluid velocity through membrane : 7 -

"referring now to the drawings , there is illustrated in fig1 a hydrokinetic torque converter , shown generally at 10 , includes a bladed impeller 12 connected drivably to a vehicle engine crankshaft 14 . a bladed turbine 16 is connected to drive sprocket 18 of a chain transfer drive . a bladed stator 20 is located between the toroidal flow exit section of the turbine of the turbine flow entrance section of the impeller and acts in known fashion to change the direction of the toroidal fluid flow , thus making possible a torque multiplication in the torque converter 10 . during steady - state operation in higher gear ratios , a friction bypass clutch 22 may be engaged to drivably connect the impeller 12 and the turbine 16 , thus effectively removing the hydrokinetic torque flow path from the driveline . stator 20 is anchored against rotation in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the impeller by an overrunning brake 24 , which is grounded to stator sleeve shaft 26 . a pair of simple planetary gear units 28 and 30 is rotatably mounted about the axis of output shaft 32 that is arranged in spaced parallel disposition with respect to the engine crankshaft axis . unit 28 includes ring gear 34 , sun gear 36 , carrier 38 and planet pinions 40 that are journalled on carrier 38 in meshing engagement with ring gear 34 and sun gear 36 . gear unit 30 comprises ring gear 42 , sun gear 44 , carrier 46 and planet pinions 48 , which are journalled on carrier 46 in meshing engagement with sun gear 44 and ring gear 42 . carrier 46 forms a torque output element for the gearing and is drivably connected to output member 48 , which is connected to final drive sun gear 50 of final drive planetary gear unit 52 . final drive gear unit 52 includes , in addition to sun gear 50 , a ring gear 54 , a carrier 56 and planet pinions 58 journalled on carrier 56 in meshing engagement with sun gear 50 and ring gear 54 . carrier 56 acts as a torque output element of the gear unit 52 and is connected to ring gear 60 and differential gear unit 62 . a compound carrier 64 forms a part of the gear unit 62 that rotatably journals a first pair of pinions 66 , which mesh with a ring gear 60 and with a second set of planetary pinions 68 , the latter meshing with sun gear 70 . sun gear 70 in turn is drivably connected to output shaft 32 . carrier 64 is drivably connected to a companion torque output shaft 72 . shaft 32 is connected to one traction wheel of the vehicle , and the opposite traction wheel of the vehicle is connected to output shaft 72 . the connections between the traction wheels and the respective output shafts is achieved by universal coupling and half shaft assemblies in known fashion . a third simple planetary gear unit 74 is located between the pair of gear units previously described and the hydrokinetic torque converter . it comprises a ring gear 76 , a sun gear 78 , a carrier 80 and planet pinions 82 journalled on the carrier 80 in meshing engagement with ring gear 76 and sun gear 78 . carrier 80 is connected to torque transfer sleeve shaft 84 , which is drivably connected to ring gear 34 of gear unit 28 and to ring gear 42 of gear unit 30 . an overrunning brake 86 that has an outer race 88 grounded to the transmission housing as shown at 90 is adapted to anchor sun gear 44 during operation in each of the first four overdriving ratios , thus providing a torque reaction point for the gear system . ring gear 54 is permanently anchored to the housing as shown at 92 , thus permitting the final drive gear unit 52 to multiply the torque delivered through the gear units 74 , 28 and 30 in each of the driving ratios . a friction brake band 94 surrounds brake drum 96 which , in turn , is connected to sun gear 44 . the brake band 94 is applied to anchor the sun gear 44 during hill braking operation and during reverse - drive operation . a disc brake shown generally at 98 is adapted to anchor the carrier 38 against the transmission housing during operation in the lowest ratio and in reverse drive . sun gear 36 is a torque input element flow transmission . during operation in reverse drive , sun gear 36 is connected to driven sprocket 100 by means of reverse clutch 102 , the latter acting as a driving connection between the driven sprocket 100 and brake drum 104 . sun gear 36 is connected directly to the brake drum 104 . driven sprocket 100 is connected to driving sprocket 18 through a torque transfer drive chain 106 . during forward drive operation , drive sprocket 100 is connected to sun gear 78 by forward drive clutch 106 . the forward drive clutch 106 is engaged during operation in the first three forward - driving ratios . a direct - drive clutch 108 connects ring gear 76 with the driven sprocket 100 during operation in the third and fourth forward driving ratios as well as during the fifth driving ratio . when direct drive clutch 108 and the forward clutch 106 are engaged simultaneously , ring gear 76 is connected to sun gear 78 so that the elements of the gear unit 74 rotate in unison with a one - to - one speed ratio . to effect a fifth forward - driving ratio , friction clutch 109 is applied , thus establishing a driving connection between sleeve shaft 84 and sun gear 44 of gear unit 30 to lock sun gear 44 to ring gear 42 so that the speed ratio developed by gear unit 30 is unity . the neutral idle feature of the invention is achieved by controlling engagement and release of forward clutch 106 . when the vehicle is at a standstill and the engine is idling , the engine 10 will tend to drive the turbine because of the hydrokinetic torque multiplication effect of the converter 10 . thus , a driving torque will be delivered to the traction wheels through the gearing , even when the engine is idling . in prior art designs , it is necessary to maintain the accelerator pedal at a sufficiently advanced position so that the engine will idle at a speed that will avoid undue engine harshness . it further is necessary for the vehicle operator to maintain his foot on the vehicle brake to avoid creeping of the vehicle with the engine idling . by disengaging the clutch 106 to establish a neutral idle condition , the torque flow path to the traction wheel is interrupted when the engine is idling with the vehicle at a standstill . fig2 shows a chart that indicates the clutches and the brakes that are applied and released to establish each of the five forward - driving ratios as well as the reverse ratio . the sun gear 36 is anchored by a second and fourth ratio brake band 110 . that brake band is applied also during fifth ratio operation so that sun gear 36 may act as a reaction point as the ring gear 34 is overdriven and as torque is delivered to the gear unit 28 through the carrier 38 and through the direct - drive clutch 108 . in fig2 the forward - drive clutch 106 is designated as clutch fwd , the direct - drive clutch 108 is designated as clutch dir , the reverse disc brake 98 is referred to as the lo / rev brake , the fifth ratio clutch 109 is identified as 5cl clutch , and brake band 110 is identified as 2 / 4 band . first ratio drive is achieved by engaging brake band 94 , which anchors sun gear 44 . also , disc brake 98 is applied , and forward clutch 106 is applied . thus , sun gear 78 is connected to the driven sprocket at 100 , and the underdriven motion imparted to the carrier 80 is transferred to the ring gear 42 of gear unit 30 . in fig2 brake band 94 is referred to as the hb and rev band . the reverse clutch 102 is identified in fig2 as the rev clutch . a schematic representation of a microprocessor control system , shown generally at 200 , is shown in fig3 . the engine is generally designated by reference numeral 228 . operating variables for the engine , such as manifold pressure and coolant temperature and engine speed , are measured by analog sensors and distributed to an electronic microprocessor 230 . the signal passage for manifold pressure is shown at 232 . the engine coolant temperature signal is distributed to the processor 230 through signal line 234 . the engine speed signal is distributed to the processor 230 through line 236 . other variables that are measured and distributed to the processor are a signal indicating the range selection or transmission manual valve position . this signal is distributed through signal passage 238 . turbine speed also is measured , and that value is distributed to the processor through signal line 240 . the torque output shaft speed for the transmission is distributed to the processor through signal line 242 . a bypass clutch pressure signal is distributed to the processor through signal line 244 , but that signal is irrelevant to the present invention . transmission oil temperature for the engine is measured , and the signal representing that value is distributed to the processor through signal line 246 . a brake signal is distributed to the processor through signal line 248 . the presence of a signal at line 248 will indicate whether the vehicle brakes are applied or released by the vehicle operator . the processor 230 will receive the information developed by the sensors and condition it so that it may be used in digital form by the central processor unit . the central processor unit identified at 250 processes the information delivered to the processor 230 in a manner that will be described subsequently using algorithms that are stored in memory 252 . the output signals from the processor 230 are delivered to a valve body 254 through signal line 256 . the output data includes shift signals delivered to the shift solenoids that control the ratio changes . the operation of the valve body 254 and the solenoid signals are described in commonly - assigned u . s . pat . no 5 , 272 , 630 , herein incorporated by reference . the output signal developed by the valve body 254 delivered through signal line 258 controls the operation of the clutches and brakes of the transmission illustrated in fig1 . for purposes of describing the benefits of the present invention , a comparison to prior art neutral idle characteristics will first be made with reference to fig4 which shows the prior art neutral idle clutch characteristics for a transmission having an open loop - type converter . this type of transmission is further described in commonly - assigned u . s . pat . no . 5 , 272 , 630 . in fig4 time is plotted on the abscissa ; and output shaft torque , clutch fluid pressure , engine speed and turbine speed are plotted on the ordinate . the forward clutch pressure , the engine speed , the turbine speed and the output shaft torque assume initially the values shown in region a of fig4 . it is seen from fig4 that the turbine speed is zero since the vehicle is at rest . the difference between engine speed and turbine speed represents the slip that exists when the vehicle comes to rest and before the neutral idle mode begins . at time b , the neutral idle mode is initiated , which results in an exhaust of pressure from the forward clutch . this results in a decay of the forward clutch pressure over a short period of time , as indicated by the curve c in fig4 . the output shaft torque decays , as shown by curve d , as the forward clutch pressure is relieved . as the forward clutch loses capacity following initiation of a neutral start mode , the turbine speed will increase , as shown at e , until it reaches the normal turbine speed for engine idle , which may be 600 rpm as shown at f in fig4 . the engine speed at that time in a typical vehicle installation may be about 800 rpm as shown at g . fig4 illustrates at point h what happens , according to the prior art , when the operator terminates the neutral idle mode by advancing the accelerator pedal . an immediate increase in the forward clutch pressure then will occur until a transition pressure indicated at point i is reached . it is during this interval that the clutch servo cylinder is filling and the clutch servo piston is stroking . because the engine throttle is advanced , the engine speed will respond to the advancing throttle and will increase as shown by the ramp j in fig4 . the engine speed continues to increase until the clutch servo is fully stroked . at that time , the engine speed will have reached a peak value shown at k . when the piston for the forward clutch servo is stroked and the forward clutch gains capacity , the output shaft torque will sharply rise , as indicated by the steep slope curved portion l , until it reaches a peak value shown at m . the achievement of the peak value m is coincident generally with the peak engine speed , the latter immediately decreasing in value at a fast rate , as shown at n . the decreasing engine speed is accompanied by a substantial inertia torque that contributes to the achievement of the peak value m for the output shaft torque . the clutch pressure will continue to increase following the stroking of the clutch servo piston and progressively increase at a rapid rate , as shown by the curve 0 , until a final clutch pressure value is reached , as shown at p . the output shaft torque will be subjected to torque fluctuations , as demonstrated by the oscillating torque values q following clutch engagement . the prior art torque curve illustrated in fig4 is perceptible as a “ slip bump ” disturbance that occurs following the advancement of the accelerator pedal when the operator demands engine torque levels that would produce a turbine torque beyond the forward clutch capacity during neutral idle operation . the subsequent uneven engine response is undesirable . the control strategy of the present invention that avoids these undesirable features of the prior art will now be explained with reference to fig5 and 7 . referring now to fig5 the routine executed by microprocessor 230 for controlling engine torque output during launch from neutral idle operation according to a preferred method of the invention will now described . the vehicle begins in the neutral idle operating condition ( step 500 ). as described above , the neutral idle operating condition results in an exhaust of pressure from the forward clutch at time b in fig4 . this results in a decay of the forward clutch pressure over a short period of time , as indicated by the curve c in fig4 . the output shaft torque decays , as shown by curve d , as the forward clutch pressure is relieved . as the forward clutch loses capacity following initiation of a neutral start mode , the turbine speed will increase , as shown at e , until it reaches the normal turbine speed for engine idle , which may be 600 rpm as shown at f in fig4 . the engine speed at that time in a typical vehicle installation may be about 800 rpm as shown at g . at some point in time , the vehicle operator advances the accelerator pedal ( step 502 ) to terminate neutral idle operation as shown at h in fig4 . then , the microprocessor 230 determines an engine brake torque limit ( step 504 ) and a requested engine torque output derived from operator demand ( step 506 ). these values are used to determine the amount of torque that will actually be supplied by the engine at that particular time . according to the present invention , the engine brake torque limit can be determined in a variety of ways . a first preferred method comprises employing a generally increasing pre - determined function to determine an appropriate engine brake torque limit at a given time subsequent to ceasing neutral idle operation . specifically , for a given elapsed time since the neutral idle operation was ceased , the function provides an appropriate engine brake torque limit . because it is known that the capacity of the transmission &# 39 ; s forward clutch increases with time , the function provides generally higher engine brake torque limits as the elapsed time increases . the function will generally provide engine brake torque limits that follow the known increasing capacity characteristics of a forward clutch , as illustrated in fig6 . a second preferred method for determining the engine brake torque limit comprises estimating the torque capacity of the forward clutch during the launch period using a mathematical model that depends on various operating parameters , including clutch pressure . then , the engine brake torque limit is calculated based on the estimated forward clutch torque capacity and a calibrated delta turbine torque offset value . the calibrated delta turbine torque value may be positive or negative to facilitate tuning of forward clutch engagement during neutral idle operation . specifically , according to the second preferred method , the engine brake torque limit is determined by the following equation : tqe_brk  _limit = forward_clutch  _torque  _capacity + tq_delta fn_conv   ( nt ne ) fn_conv is the torque multiplication of the torque converter . fn_conv is a well - known function that can be expressed as the turbine torque divided by the engine torque , and tq_delta is a calibrated positive or negative offset . tq_delta can be a negative offset to reduce the engine torque to ensure short enough engagement time of the forward clutch . tq_delta can be a positive offset to compensate for the time lag in generating engine torque . the forward clutch torque capacity used to determine the engine brake torque limit is calculated using the following equation : fn_cap is a function that transforms the forward clutch pressure ( either commanded or measured ) into a torque capacity based on clutch pressure and other variables , such as transmission fluid temperature , clutch design , and the like . the fn_cap function also includes a conversion factor from torque measured at the forward clutch to torque measured at the turbine shaft . irrespective of the particular method used to determine the engine brake torque limit , the actual torque output supplied by the engine is limited based on the lesser of the engine brake torque limit and the level of torque requested by the vehicle operator ( step 508 ). in terms of a mathematical expression , the level of torque supplied by the engine is expressed as follows : the controller may limit engine torque output in a variety of well - known ways , including adjusting engine air / fuel ratio , engine spark , etc . next , the controller determines whether the launch period from neutral idle operation is complete ( step 510 ). if so , the algorithm ends ( step 512 ). if not , then steps 502 - 508 are repeated . each time the algorithm is repeated , the engine brake torque limit increases , and , assuming the requested torque output is sufficiently high , so does the actual engine torque output . fig6 is a graph that compares a sample requested engine torque , the engine brake torque limit , and the actual engine torque output , according to the present invention . the solid line represents the requested engine torque and the line with explicit data points represents the maximum torque brake limit produced by the method of the invention . the dashed line illustrates the actual engine torque output according to the invention . as shown in fig6 the requested engine torque rises steeply due to operator demand at around 0 . 3 seconds to a maximum engine torque of about 120 ft / lbs . and slightly decreases to a relatively constant value of about 100 ft / lbs . the method of the invention limits the actual engine torque output , producing a less abrupt increase in torque output . the result is a smooth transition from neutral idle operation to full engagement of the front clutch without unnecessarily sacrificing desired power during the launch period . as describe above , by limiting actual engine output torque based on the clutch capacity of the engaging clutch during vehicle launch , it is possible to maximize available torque to the driver , while at the time preventing uneven response . preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed . a person of ordinary skill in the art would realize , however , that certain modifications would come within the teachings of this invention . for example , the teachings of this invention apply when a different clutch other than the forward clutch or identified as the forward clutch is allowed to slip during neutral idle operation . therefore , the following claims should be studied to determine the true scope and content of the invention .",1
"fig1 is a block diagram of a multiprocessor , multicelled system 100 . system 100 is composed of processing cells 105 - 120 and memory . the four cells communicate with , and , among each other through “ ganged ” crossbar 125 and 130 , each routing one half of a 72 bit wide data transfer between cells . cell 1 ( 105 ) can access cell 2 ( 110 ) through either crossbar 125 or crossbar 130 . similarly , cell 3 ( 115 ) can also access cell 2 ( 110 ) through either crossbar 125 or crossbar 130 . if cell 1 ( 105 ) transmits information to cell 2 ( 110 ) the information is sent from cell 1 &# 39 ; s coherency controller through the link 135 to crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 through link 145 . then from crossbar 125 through link 150 , crossbar 130 through link 140 to cell 2 &# 39 ; s coherency controller . bandwidth is improved through the use of bit - slicing which is used to divide the information between crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 . for instance , cell 1 ( 105 &# 39 ; s ) coherency controller can divide a message which consists of 72 bits into two 36 bit wide packets . the first 36 bit packet ( i . e ., upper order ), packet a , can be sent via link 135 to crossbar 125 and via link 150 from crossbar 125 to cell 2 ( 110 &# 39 ; s ) coherency controller . at the same time cell 1 ( 105 &# 39 ; s ) coherency controller sends the second ( i . e ., lower order ) 36 bits of the message in packet b across link 145 to crossbar 130 and across link 140 to the coherency controller of cell 2 ( 110 ). in this mannner , the length of time required to transmit the message is cut approximately in half in comparison to a sequential transmission through a single switch . the 36 bits which were transferred via crossbar 125 and the 36 bits transferred via crossbar 130 are merged within cell 2 ( 110 &# 39 ; s ) coherency controller to reform the original message . referring to fig2 a and 2b , each crossbar element can have up to eight connections . for instance , crossbar 202 uses four of its ports to connect to cells 204 - 210 . three of crossbar 202 &# 39 ; s remaining connections are used to connect to the other three crossbars of the four crossbar system . link 212 connects crossbar 202 to crossbar 210 , link 214 connects crossbar 202 to crossbar 216 , and link 218 connects crossbar 202 to crossbar 220 . crossbar 202 also includes a port connecting to router 222 used to communicate with a similar system of crossbars and cells . each of the crossbars 202 , 210 , 216 and 220 include two parallel , 36 bit wide crossbar switching units ( not shown ) to provide a combined 72 bit wide switching capability . such an arrangement provides a bit sliced transfer of messages . while both crossbar switching units operate synchronously with regard to a common clock signal , the units do not coordinate transfer of respective message portions or bit slices . eliminating or avoiding intramessage coordination and synchronization between crossbar switching units avoids the associated processing delay . since errors causing the crossbar switching units to desynchronize are rare , this time saving is preferable to synchronization overhead which would otherwise be required . however , in the event of loss of this “ passive ” synchronization , steps must be taken to recoordinate message handling so that complete 72 bit wide data transfers are accomplished . for example , assume , as in the present embodiment of the invention , there are five classes of flow control messages that can be sent from a cell via a crossbar to the rest of the system . a first flow control is a read request , which requests access to memory located within a different cell . a second flow control class is a memory return used to respond to a read request in which information contained in a memory location is sent to the requesting processor . a third flow control class is a processor respond in which a specific processor located within a cell responds to a request from another processor . a fourth flow control class is an input / output ( i / o ) transaction , a read or write request , from an i / o card together with any associated interrupts . a fifth flow control class consists of crossbar interconnect networks for running system backup implemented as a fast fail - over mode or a hot standby . in a preferred embodiment of the present invention , priorities are established between the various flow controls to ensure equal treatment between the flow controls . for instance , a read request should not be allowed to block a data return from memory . to provide for prioritization , five buffers in the form of a circular queue are established for each type of flow control within each port of a crossbar . in the preferred embodiment of the present invention , forty buffers are established , five for each flow control within each of the eight input ports of a crossbar . referring now to fig3 if processor 305 of cell 105 initiates communication with processor 310 of cell 110 communication messages are routed from processor 305 of cell 105 to the coherency controller 315 of cell 105 . the coherency controller 315 bit - slices or divides the communication up into two parallel 36 bit packets . packet a ( not shown ) is sent via link 135 to crossbar 125 and then via link 150 to coherency controller 320 of cell 110 . in parallel , packet b , containing the second set of 36 bits , is sent from coherency controller 315 of cell 105 via link 145 to crossbar 130 and then via link 140 to coherency control 320 of cell 110 . in the transmission of this communication , crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 operate in lock step or , in synchronized mode based on having a common clock signal , i . e ., are possibly synchronized . upon receipt of both packet a and packet b coherency controller 320 of cell 110 reassembles the communication in the proper format and sends the information to processor 310 of cell 110 . if an error occurs during the transmission of packet a or packet b via request crossbars 125 and crossbar 130 , synchronization between crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 would be lost . the present invention relates to a method for reestablishing , the synchronization between crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 . but , before the synchronization can be reestablished the error first has to be detected . one situation in which an error can be detected is through parity checks performed by the crossbars . when packet a is sent from coherency controller 315 of cell 105 , to crossbar 125 , the latter performs a parity check to ensure that the received data survived the transmission without modification . if a single bit error occurs in the transmission of packet a from coherency controller 315 of cell 105 to the crossbar 125 , by using duplicated data and parity bits , crossbar 125 can correct the changed bit to recover the original message . if , however , two or more bits have been corrupted in the transmission of packet a from coherency controller 315 of cell 105 to crossbar 125 , the error is unrecoverable and therefore fatal . in the presence of a fatal error , crossbar 125 will not transmit packet a to coherency controller 320 of cell 110 via link 150 . nearly simultaneously ( i . e . substantially in parallel ), coherency controller 315 of cell 105 transmits packet b over link 145 to crossbar 130 . crossbar 130 separately and independently performs a parity check on packet b upon receipt . in the absence of an error within packet b , crossbar 130 transmits packet b via link 140 to coherency controller 320 of cell 110 . however , in trying to reformat the original message , coherency controller 320 will have received packet b but will not have received packet a and will therefore determine that an error has occurred in the transmission of packet a . additionally , the presence of this error in packet a interrupts synchronization or lock step between the crossbars . this loss of synchronization between crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 is further exacerbated by the time delay associated with coherency controller 320 of cell 110 &# 39 ; s identification of the receipt of packet b without a corresponding packet a . in the preferred embodiment of the invention , crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 can be resynchronized by reinitializing the link between crossbar 125 and cell 105 simultaneously , or nearly so , with the reinitialization of the link between crossbar 130 and cell 105 . in addition to reinitializing the link between the crossbars and cell 105 the arbitration history must also be realigned . in order to realign the arbitration history the traffic between cell 105 and the two crossbars 125 and 130 must be stopped . thereafter , the realignment of the arbitration can occur simultaneously with the reinitialization of the links between cell 105 and crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 . this can be accomplished because competition for the resources for the links 135 and 145 has been halted . when all other traffic between cell 105 and the crossbars has been halted , there is no contention in the execution of the reinitialization command and other transmissions , so that there is only one contestant requesting the resource , the reinitialization command . there are at least two ways in which the traffic can be halted between cell 105 and the crossbars . a first implementation is in software . referring again to fig3 cell 105 includes four processors , 305 , 325 , 330 ) and 335 . preferably , one of these processors will be designated a master or “ monarch ” processor . for example , if processor 305 of cell 105 is designated the monarch processor , the processor will include a software error handling routine to resolving transmission problems between cell 105 and the crossbars . once an error has been detected , processor 305 ( the monarch processor ), sends a message to both crossbar 125 and crossbar 130 to stop all traffic to and from cell 105 . additionally , upon detection of the receipt of packet a without packet b the coherency controller 320 in cell 110 also sends a message to stop communications between cell 105 and both crossbars 125 and 130 . alternatively , the error handling can be implemented in hardware and / or firmware . for example , cell 105 may include the appropriate logic circuitry such that upon detection of the error in the transmission from cell 105 to crossbar 125 and / or crossbar 130 , a control message is sent to both crossbars to halt all traffic addressed to cell 105 . in the hardware implementation , upon detection of a fatal error , the port enters an error handling mode where the port drops all packets which are not control and status register access packets . when the fatal error is resolved , software reenables the acceptance of all packets . assuming an initial communications fault between cell 105 and cell 110 the links between cell 110 and crossbars 125 and 130 must be reinitialized and the arbitration associated with the crossbar &# 39 ; s port to cell 110 must be reset . in order to reinitialize the link between cell 110 and crossbars 125 and 130 , all messages or all traffic must be stopped between these devices , i . e ., cell 110 and the two crossbars . again , both software and hardware implementations of the invention described ensure that all traffic is stopped between cell 110 and crossbars 125 and 130 . the arbitration history for crossbars 125 and 130 is reset simultaneously with the reinitialization of the link between cell 110 and the crossbars . in a preferred embodiment of the invention an arb_reset command is used to reset the port arbitration history registers . this arbitration history reset is done as part of a fatal error recovery routine in order to regain lock step between the two crossbar elements . performing the arbitration history reset at the same time as reinitializing the link between the affected cell and the crossbar elements guarantees that both arbitration schemes within the crossbars are again in lock - step , i . e ., synchronized . among the advantages of the present invention is that if processor 340 of cell 115 is in the process of transmitting information or communicating with processor 345 of cell 120 , the reinitialization of the link between crossbars 125 and 130 with cells 105 and 110 does not affect that communication . processor 340 of cell 115 can still communicate packet c ( the first 36 bits of data ) via coherency controller 350 of cell 115 via link 355 to crossbar 125 and via link 360 to coherency controller 365 of cell 120 . the corresponding packet d ( the second 36 bits of data ) can also be sent from processor 340 of cell 115 to coherency controller 350 of cell 115 via link 370 to crossbar 130 and via link 375 to coherency controller 365 of cell 120 . again coherency controller 365 of cell 120 will combine packets c and d to regenerate the original message which is then sent to processor 345 of cell 120 . the reinitialization of the link between cell 105 and crossbars 125 and 130 does not effect the transmission of data between cells 115 and 120 . similarly , the reinitialization and reset of arbitration history between cell and crossbars 125 and 130 does not affect the transmission of information from cell 115 to cell 120 . although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail , it should be understood that various changes , substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims . moreover , the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process , machine , manufacture ,

, machines , manufacture , compositions of matter , means , methods , or steps , presently existing or later to be developed that perform substantially the same function or achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding embodiments described herein may be utilized according to the present invention . accordingly , the appended claims are intended to include within their scope such

"a typical prior art pneumatic tire is depicted in fig1 and is indicated generally by the numeral 10 . tire 10 includes a body 12 that includes a reinforcing cord ply 14 , at least one body ply 16 , and an innerliner 18 . innerliner 18 includes an outer surface that faces the chamber 20 formed when tire 10 is mounted on a rim ( not shown ). tire 10 also includes a pair of bead rings 22 and a pair of apex fillers 24 . the first embodiment of the invention is depicted in fig2 with the pneumatic tire indicated generally by the numeral 30 . tire 30 includes many of the same body elements as tire 10 but further includes an electronic monitoring device 32 mounted to pneumatic tire 30 . electronic monitoring device 32 includes a monitoring package 34 mounted within body 12 and a power source 36 mounted to innerliner 18 . monitoring package 34 receives power from power source 36 through electrical coupling . specifically , monitoring package 34 receives power through close proximity electromagnetic coupling . electronic monitoring package 34 may include a variety of components that are known in the art to monitor at least one engineering condition of pneumatic tire 30 and transmit information out of tire 30 . electronic monitoring package 34 may include at least one sensing element that monitors or measures an engineering condition of tire 30 . monitoring package 34 may further include a device to store the information or data gathered by the sensor , a cpu , a transmitter / receiver , and an antenna . any of a variety of known combinations of these elements may be present in monitoring package 34 for gathering data and transmitting data out of tire 30 . in the preferred embodiment , monitoring package 34 is encapsulated with an encapsulation material 38 to protect monitoring package 34 . encapsulation material 38 may be any of a variety of encapsulation materials known in the art such as epoxies . power source 36 is also preferably encapsulated with an encapsulation material 38 . in the preferred embodiment of the invention , power source 36 is mounted to a patch 40 that mounts power source 36 to innerliner 18 . in other embodiments , power source

42 is in direct electrical communication with monitoring package 34 and second coupling element 44 is in direct electrical communication with power source 36 . coupling elements 42 and 44 are arranged to be aligned and spaced apart such that power may be transferred from power source 36 to monitoring package 34 . the power transfer occurs because first coupling element 42 is placed in the field created by second coupling element 44 . a position of first coupling element 42 within the field of second coupling element 44 induces a current in second element 42 to transfer the power from power source 36 to monitoring package 34 . in the embodiment of the invention depicted in fig2 tire 30 is manufactured by inserting monitoring package 34 into body 12 when body 12 is being assembled . monitoring package 34 is positioned such that body cords 14 are disposed between monitoring package 34 and the interior body ply 16 . monitoring package 34 is placed in this position before body 12 is cured preferably at the green tire stage . monitoring package 34 is then cured within body 12 when the green tire is cured . after body 12 is cured , power source 36 is connected to innerliner 18 such that first and second coupling elements 42 and 44 are aligned . the alignment that is required is an alignment that allows the first and second coupling elements 42 and 44 to communicate with each other and to transfer power from power source 36 to monitoring package 34 . in the embodiment depicted in fig2 coupling elements 42 and 44 are disposed directly across from each other through reinforcing cord ply 14 , body ply 16 , and innerliner 18 . mounting monitoring package 34 and power source 36 in this manner allows power source 36 to be readily replaced without changing the position of monitoring package 34 . this method also allows monitoring package 34 to be positioned in a desired location within tire 30 . the use of coupling elements 42 and 44 allow monitoring package 34 to be cured within tire 30 . an alternative embodiment of the invention is depicted in fig3 with the tire indicated generally by the numeral 50 . monitoring device 32 is positioned in a different position in tire 50 than in tire 30 . in tire 50 , monitoring package 34 is positioned between reinforcing cord ply 14 and body ply 16 . the arrangement of coupling elements 42 and 44

inner surface of innerliner 18 . in each of the embodiments of fig4 , and 6 , first and second coupling elements 42 and 44 are aligned and spaced apart to provide power between power source 36 and monitoring package 34 . tire 90 is depicted in fig7 with monitoring package 34 embedded within a patch 92 connected to innerliner 18 . patch 92 may be a rubber patch that is fabricated separately from body 12 of tire 90 and later connected to innerliner 18 . in another embodiment , patch 92 is an anchoring patch that is connected to innerliner 18 before body 12 of tire 90 is cured . the green tire

in u . s . patent applications ser . nos . 09 / 205 , 931 and 09 / 206 , 273 , filed dec . 4 , 1998 , which are owned by the assignee of the present application . in the other embodiment where patch 92 is an attachment patch , patch 92 is fabricated and cured separate from body 12 . in this embodiment , monitoring package 34 is connected to attachment patch 92 or embedded within attachment patch 92 before patch 92 is cured . power source 36 may be attached to patch 92 before patch 92 is connected to innerliner 18 or after patch 92 is connected to innerliner 18 . accordingly , the improved

"embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings . fig1 shows a tire patch 10 of the present invention . the tire patch is of a preselected configuration , which as shown , is rectangular in shape . the patch may be of any other convenient configuration , but is shown as rectangular , and therefore has four edges 11 . the tire patch 10 has a first side 12 for interfacing with a face of an encapsulated tag assembly 30 , shown in fig2 . the patch has a second opposite side 14 approximating the contour of an inner liner of a tire . the contour of the second side 14 preferably is radiused to have about the same radius as the tire to which it is assembled , the radius being larger for larger tires . for very large tires , such as for off - the - road tires , the radius may be eliminated altogether , so that there is no contour and the opposite side is flat , having no contour . the rubber patch is vulcanized at a preselected temperature and for a time sufficient to vulcanize the patch . the patch may be rubber selected from the group consisting of ethylene propylene diene monomer ( epdm ) rubber , butyl rubber , natural rubber , neoprene and mixtures thereof . one preferred embodiment is a mixture of chlorobutyl rubber and natural rubber . another preferred embodiment is a mixture of styrene - butadiene rubber ( sbr ) and natural rubber . typically , patches made of these rubber compositions may be cured by heating to a temperature of about 150 ° c . and holding at this temperature for about 30 minutes . the time and temperature may be modified as necessary to achieve sufficient curing of the patch for further assembly . the first side 12 includes a recessed cavity 16 which is surrounded by a raised ridge 18 of rubbery polymer material . the recessed cavity optionally may have a roughened bottom surface to increase its surface area . the ridge 18 preferably is of the same material as the remainder of the patch . the ridge of material should be of sufficient height to capture the encapsulated rigid tag 30 . in a preferred embodiment , the ridge is about one eighth ( ⅛ ″) inch . the patch is gradually tapered from the ridge 18 of material of the first side of the patch 12 , outwardly toward the edges of the patch . affixed to the second side 14 of the vulcanized tire patch is a dual cure bonding layer 20 , which has a second side ( not shown ) and a first side 22 . this dual cure bonding layer 20 may be assembled to the patch at any time following vulcanization of the patch and prior to assembly of the patch assembly to the tire innerliner . the dual cure bonding layer 20 is permanently assembled to the patch . a non - curing cement ( not shown ) is applied to side 14 of the patch in order to hold the dual cure bonding layer 20 onto the patch . the non - curing cement and the dual cure bonding layer 20 are products of patch rubber company . the important feature of the dual cure bonding layer 20 is that it can be chemically activated and cured , without the need for heating to an elevated temperature . the process is diffusion controlled , however , and some minimal heating will speed the curing process . the dual cure bonding layer 20 may be any material which can be activated and cured to the vulcanized rubber of the tire inner liner and the vulcanized patch . preferably , however , the dual cure bonding rubber is natural rubber . the dual cure bonding rubber , after application of the activating cement , may cure at room temperature over a period of seventy two ( 72 ) hours . however , if more rapid curing is desired this may be accomplished by heating to 45 ° c . for at least twenty four hours . fig2 shows a cross - sectional view of the rigid tag assembly 30 , showing the encapsulated electronic monitoring device 32 . monitoring device may be a circuit board 34 which includes electronic memory as well as a variety of sensors for monitoring engineering conditions such as , for example , pressure , temperature and distance traveled . the monitoring device is discussed in detail in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 562 , 787 , incorporated herein by reference . mounted to the board is a power source 36 , such a battery , which permits the active monitoring of the engineering conditions , which may be stored in the electronic memory for later use . the power source provides a bulge 38 to the rigid tag assembly , although this feature is expected to become less prominent or even completely eliminated as advances in battery technology produce smaller yet more powerful batteries . the rigid tag assembly may also house an antenna , or may provide for assembly of an antenna which protrudes from the tag assembly so that the circuitry on the board can be activated for transmittal at will . the circuit board including sensors , battery and optional antenna , hereinafter referred to as the electronic monitoring device , are encapsulated in a potting material 40 which solidifies into a rigid material . referring to fig3 the electronic monitoring device is placed within a mold 50 having a first half 52 and a second half 54 . at least one of the mold halves has a face with increased surface area , shown as surface 56 in the second half 54 of mold 40 . the mold is then filled with the potting material 40 in fluid form , which fills the mold and flows around the electronic monitoring device and allowed to cure , resulting in a rigid tag assembly . any potting material having a young &# 39 ; s modulus of at least 30 , 000 psi and which is capable of being molded around the electronic monitoring device without damaging any of the components of the device . preferably , the potting material has a young &# 39 ; s modulus of at least about 100 , 000 psi . two preferred potting materials include epoxy and urethane . if desired , the curing of the potting material around the electronic device may be accelerated by preheating the mold to an elevated temperature which is above ambient , but below the temperature at which damage to the electronic monitoring device will occur . a preferred temperature is about 80 ° c . after the epoxy has been cured , the mold halves 52 , 54 are separated , yielding a rigid , encapsulated tag assembly 30 . tag assembly 30 has a bottom surface 42 having increased surface finish which is simply the impression of surface 56 from mold half 54 . rigid tag assembly 30 is assembled into the recessed cavity 16 on the first side 12 of tire patch 10 either after vulcanization of the patch or after assembly of the dual bond curing layer 20 to the patch . in order to permanently adhere tag assembly 30 to patch 10 , a fluid adhesive is applied to the interface between tag assembly 30 and recess 16 . this adhesive , preferably an epoxy adhesive , may be applied conveniently to surface 42 of tag assembly or to the base of recess 16 . as tag assembly 30 is pressed into recessed cavity 16 , the epoxy adhesive flows evenly along the interface between surface 42 and the base of recess 16 . the increased surface area between the base of recessed cavity 16 and surface 52 provides for additional bonding area and a stronger bond . because the ridges around the recess are closely dimensioned to correspond to the dimensions of tag assembly 30 , excess epoxy will flow between tag assembly 30 and ridge 18 , and some epoxy may even flow out from this region . of course , the flow of epoxy in this region will add to the strength of the assembly as the epoxy cures . while the epoxy can be allowed to cure at room temperature , the curing process can be accelerated by heating the assembly at an elevated temperature , for example a temperature of from about 75 - 90 ° c . for at least about 30 minutes . if the dual cure bonding layer 20 has not already been assembled to the second side 14 of tire patch 10 , it may be added at this time to form patch assembly 60 . referring now to fig5 patch assembly 60 was then assembled to the inner liner 75 of tire 70 . activating cement was first applied to second side ( not shown ) of dual cure bonding layer 20 . the patch assembly was then stitched to the inner liner of the vulcanized tire and the patch assembly / tire assembly was allowed to cure for a sufficient time and temperature to form a strong bond between the tire and the patch assembly . the times and temperatures utilized for this curing may be basically the same times and temperatures as previously discussed . to ensure a strong bond , the patch assembly optionally may be clamped to the tire inner liner 75 , until the curing cycle is completed . fig6 shows an alternative configuration of a tire patch 110 of the present invention . the tire patch 110 is of a preselected configuration , which as shown , is round in shape . the tire patch 110 has a first side 112 for interfacing with a face of an encapsulated tag assembly 130 , shown in cross - section in fig7 . first side 112 includes a recessed cavity 116 , which in this alternative configuration is formed by a cylindrical rigid insert 117 molded into the rubber patch . preferably cylindrical insert 117 is a rigid plastic material , such as nylon , epoxy or a rigid composite material such as glass - filled polyamide or glass - filled epoxy , but also may be a metal , as long as the metal does not interfere with the electronic functions and operation of tag assembly 130 . cylindrical rigid insert 117 is surrounded by a ridge 118 of rubbery material . the ridge preferably is of the same material as the remainder of the patch and should be of sufficient height to permanently hold cylindrical insert 117 in place following curing . in a preferred embodiment shown in fig6 and 7 , the ridge 118 is the same height as cylindrical insert 117 . the patch is gradually tapered from the ridge 118 of material of the first side of the patch outwardly toward the edges of the patch . recessed cavity 116 may have a roughened bottom surface to increase its surface area , as previously described , or alternatively may be smooth and made from the same material as the cylindrical insert . the patch has a second opposite side 114 which may approximate the contour of an inner liner of a tire . the contour of the second side 114 preferably is radiused to have about the same radius as the tire to which it is assembled , the radius being larger for larger tires . for very large tires , such as for off - the - road tires , the radius may be eliminated altogether , so that there is no contour and the opposite side 114 is flat , having no contour . tire patch 110 including cylindrical rigid insert 117 is cured prior to insertion of rigid tag assembly 130 to form a round patch assembly . rigid tag assembly 130 , which includes the encapsulated electronic monitoring device and has the same components as previously described , is essentially identical to rigid tag assembly 30 except for its profile , being round or circular instead of rectangular . round rigid tag assembly 130 is permanently bonded to the round patch assembly by inserting rigid tag assembly 130 into cylindrical insert 117 , as shown in fig8 after applying an epoxy adhesive such as a fusor system manufactured by lord corp . of erie pa . to the interface between the rigid tag assembly 130 and the cylindrical insert 117 . of course , the epoxy adhesive also may conveniently be applied to the interface between the bottom of cavity 116 , whether it is a roughened surface or made of the same or similar material as cylindrical insert 117 . as the rigid tag assembly 130 is inserted into cylindrical insert 117 , excess epoxy flows out from the interface , which must be removed before it cures . cylindrical insert 117 only must be of sufficient height so that after curing of the epoxy , there is sufficient bonding strength between the insert 117 and tag assembly 130 to assure no separation . although the rigid tag assembly 130 may be of the same height as cylindrical insert 117 , as shown in the preferred embodiment , it also may be lower or higher than cylindrical insert 117 upon assembly . if tag assembly 130 is higher than the cylindrical insert 117 , then insert 117 has a lower profile than the rigid tag assembly 130 so that the outer periphery of the rigid tag assembly 130 extends above the outer periphery of the cylindrical insert 117 , thereby reducing the overall amount of material required for tire patch 110 . patch assembly 160 formed by assembling rigid tag assembly 130 into tire patch 110 is bonded to a tire using the same materials and methods described above for patch assembly 60 . patch assemblies manufactured and assembled to a tire inner liner in the manner described above have run through tests equivalent to 100 , 000 miles , and have remained fully bonded to the tire . while in accordance with the patent statutes , the best mode and preferred embodiment has been set forth above , the scope of the invention is not limited thereto , but rather by the scope of the attached claims .",1
"the present invention will be described by way of illustrative examples with reference to the drawings . fig1 is a front view of an optical pickup device of an example according to the present invention . the optical pickup device is configured as described below . light 2 emitted from a light source , e . g ., a laser diode 1 passes through a grating 3 and a holographic optical element 4 , and is incident upon a beam splitter 5 composed of a glass plate 13 and a prism 14 . the incident light 2 is reflected by a mirror at an interface between the glass plate 13 and the prism 14 so as to have its optical path changed . then , the light 2 passes through a collimating lens 6 , is reflected by a mirror 7 ( i . e ., a mirror for changing the optical path of the light 2 so as to be in parallel with the direction perpendicular to the recording medium ), and is focused onto a recording medium such as a magneto - optical disk ( not shown ) by an objective lens 8 . the light 2 reflected from the magneto - optical disk is incident upon the beam splitter 5 after passing through the objective lens 8 , the mirror 7 , and the collimating lens 6 . at the beam splitter 5 , the light 2 is split into servo error signal detecting light 9 and magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 . the servo error signal detecting light 9 is incident upon the holographic optical element 4 from the beam splitter 5 . the servo error signal detecting light 9 is diffracted by the holographic optical element 4 and is guided into a photodiode 11 to be detected as a servo error signal . on the other hand , the magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 is reflected by the mirror surface on a reverse side of the glass plate 13 included in the beam splitter 5 and is guided into a coupler portion of an optical waveguide element 12 without passing through the holographic optical element 4 . the light coupled to the coupler portion of the optical waveguide element 12 is split into polarized components each having a different polarization direction , and the polarized components are guided into a photodetector . the photodetector detects a magneto - optical signal based on the polarized components . next , the beam splitter 5 will be described in detail with reference to fig2 . the beam splitter 5 is composed of the glass plate 13 and the prism 14 adhering to each other . a b - face of the glass plate 13 is a total reflection mirror and an a - face of the glass plate 13 ( i . e ., an interface between the glass plate 13 and the prism 14 ) is a partial reflection mirror or a polarizing mirror . thus , the beam splitter 5 is configured so as to have a polarization characteristic . these mirrors are made of a dielectric multi - layer film , a metallic film , or the like . in particular , when a mirror made of a multi - layer film is formed on the a - face , a kerr rotation angle ( described later ) can be multiplied . as described above , the light 2 emitted from the laser diode 1 is reflected by the a - face to travel to the objective lens 8 and the magneto - optical disk . then , the light 2 travels in the same optical path to return to the a - face . the light 2 is partially reflected by the a - face to become the servo error signal detecting light 9 . the servo error signal detecting light 9 is guided into the photodiode 11 ( i . e ., a photodetector ) by the holographic optical element 4 which is a diffracting element . on the other hand , the magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 having passed through the a - face is totally reflected by the b - face to pass through the a - face to be guided into the optical waveguide element 12 . the magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 guided into the optical waveguide element 12 does not pass through the holographic optical element 4 ; therefore , in this arrangement , the light 10 is not diffracted and as a result , the amount of the light 10 is not decreased . furthermore , in the case where the diffracted light is coupled to the optical waveguide element 12 , the variations of an incident position and an incident angle caused by the wavelength fluctuation of the incident light leads to the decrease in efficiency of optical waveguide coupling . in this arrangement , such a problem is not caused , so that a magneto - optical signal can be stably obtained . in the optical pickup device of the present example as shown in fig2 light 15 emitted from the laser diode 1 is reflected by the b - face after passing through the a - face , passes through the collimating lens 6 and the objective lens 8 , and is focused onto the magneto - optical disk . then , the light 15 reflected from the magneto - optical disk is detected by the photodetectors . this causes a signal quality to be degraded . in order to avoid this problem , the collimating lens 6 should be positioned at a sufficient distance from the objective lens 8 so as not to allow the light 15 reflected by the b - face to be incident upon the objective lens 8 . however , this arrangement is not desired , because it results in the enlargement of the optical pickup device . for example , in the case where the glass plate 13 has a thickness of 1 mm , and the collimating lens 6 has a numerical aperture ( na ) of 0 . 17 and a focal length of 10 . 7 mm , the collimating lens 6 and the objective lens 8 should be positioned at a distance of 17 mm from each other . however , as shown in fig3 and 4 , if the thickness of the glass plate 13 of the beam splitter 5 is set to be sufficiently large , a region where the light emitted from the light source and passed through the a - face is irradiated and a region where the light reflected from the magneto - optical disk and passed through the a - face is irradiated can be separated on the b - face . when a light scattering film 16 or an antireflection film 17 is provided on the region where the light emitted from the light source and passed through the a - face is irradiated , stray light caused by the light reflected by the b - face can be eliminated . therefore , it is not necessary to position the collimating lens 6 at a certain distance from the objective lens 8 ; as a result , the optical pickup device can be miniaturized without degrading a signal quality . when the beam splitter 5 is provided with a polarization characteristic , a kerr rotation angle can be multiplied ; therefore , a signal quality can be improved . assuming that the reflectance of p - polarized light of the a - face is p , and that of the s - polarized light is s , the multiplication of factor b of the kerr rotation angle satisfies the relationship b =( 1 - p )/( 1 - s ). specifically , assuming that the reflectance of the p - polarized light is 0 %, and that of the s - polarized light is 70 %, the multiplication factor b of the kerr rotation angle is 3 . 33 and the utilization factor of the s - polarized light is 9 %. in this case , the light 2 emitted from the laser diode 1 should be s - polarized light . however , an ordinary laser diode emits a beam having a far - field pattern in an elliptical shape and having an electric field component in a short axis direction of the elliptical far - field pattern . therefore , a laser beam spreads to a great degree in a direction parallel to an x - axis shown in fig5 . as a result , on the b - face of the beam splitter 5 , the light emitted from the laser diode 1 cannot be separated from the light returning from the magneto - optical disk . in this case , by providing an aperture diaphragm 18 between the laser diode 1 and the beam splitter 5 so as to limit the spreading angle of the light incident upon the beam splitter 5 , as shown in fig5 the above - mentioned problem can be solved . furthermore , in the beam splitter 5 , by providing a polarizing mirror only at a portion of the a - face performing beam - splitting , instead of forming a partial reflection mirror over the a - face , the reflection of the magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 from the a - face can be reduced . specifically , in the above example , the utilization factor of the s - polarized light can be increased from 9 % to 30 %. next , a magneto - optical signal detecting system will be described with reference to fig6 and 7 . the magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 reflected by the b - face of the beam splitter 5 is guided into the package 19 ( see fig1 ) without passing through the holographic optical element 4 . the magneto - optical signal detecting light 10 is diverged after being converged and is guided into a prism 21 as shown in fig6 . the diverged light is collimated by a microlens 22 provided on a prism 21 and is coupled to an optical waveguide element 23 at a predetermined incident angle . the light guided into the optical waveguide element 23 from the optical coupler is split into each polarized component by a polarized beam splitter . a magneto - optical signal is detected by a photodiode 24 which has received the polarized components thus split . as the polarized beam splitter , for example , a mode splitter ( japanese laid - open patent publication no . 6 - 82644 ) utilizing the difference in refractive index of each polarized beam component can be used . when a light source , a photodetector , an optical waveguide element , and the like are accommodated in the package 19 , the resulting device can be made small and light - weight ; furthermore , productivity and environmental resistance of the device can be enhanced . as shown in fig1 , the laser diode 1 can be provided on the side of the glass plate 13 of the beam splitter 5 , and the optical waveguide element 12 can be provided on the side of the prism 14 . in other words , the laser diode 1 can be positioned so as to be farther away from the collimating lens 6 , compared with the optical waveguide element 12 . in this case , the light emitted from the laser diode 1 becomes p - polarized light which spreads to a great degree in a direction parallel to a y - axis ( shown in fig1 ). this makes it unnecessary to use an aperture diaphragm . the reflection from the a - face of the light immediately after emitted from the laser diode 1 causes a problem . however , this problem can be solved by providing the polarizing mirror 19 only on a portion of the beam splitter 5 performing beam splitting . if the polarizing mirror is designed so that the reflectance of the p - polarized light has a reflectance of 30 % and the s - polarized light has a reflectance of 100 %, a kerr rotation angle multiplication factor of 3 . 33 can be obtained . next , a production example of the optical waveguide element 23 will be described . in the present example , as the optical waveguide element 23 , two optical waveguides having different structures , at a boundary between which the thickness is changed in a tapered shape , are used . the guided light is allowed to travel diagonally across the boundary . at this time , since the refractive index of the optical waveguides are different depending upon the polarization direction , each polarized light is refracted at a different refractive angle . in the present example , by providing two or more of such boundaries , the optical waveguide length is shortened . the production example will be more specifically described with reference to fig6 and 7 . first , an si substrate 25 is subjected to thermal oxidation to form a buffer layer 26 ( thickness : about 2 μm ) made of sio 2 thereon . then , as shown in fig6 a high refractive layer 29 made of glass with a high refractive index , e . g ., ta 2 o 5 is formed on a polarized beam splitting portion ( region d ) shown in fig7 . furthermore , a glass film ( corning # 7059 ) 27 is formed over the high refractive layer 29 as a waveguide layer , and an sio 2 film is formed as a gap layer for prism coupling . exemplary numerical values of each layer , such as those of refractive index and film thickness are shown below . under the above conditions , the effective refractive index of the respective regions c and d of the waveguide layer become as shown in table 1 . this leads to the difference in refractive index of each polarized beam . as shown in fig7 when the light is incident upon a boundary between the region c and the region d at an incident angle of 45 ° and is allowed to pass through a polarized beam splitting portion ( region d ) in an isosceles right triangle once , the difference in refractive angle between the respective polarized beams becomes 3 . 5 °. in order to detect each polarized beam by each photodiode 24 , the distance between the light beams on the respective photodiodes 24 is required to be about 50 μm , and the waveguide length is required to be about 850 μm . when the light is allowed to pass through the polarized beam splitting portion twice , the difference in refractive angle becomes larger ( i . e ., 7 . 6 °), and the required waveguide length can be shortened to be about 400 μm . thus , the optical waveguide element 12 can be decreased in size . the optical waveguide element 12 can be produced by the application of ic technology ; therefore , the optical waveguide element 12 has outstanding productivity . in addition , since optical systems can be integrated on one substrate , the optical waveguide element 12 can be made small and light - weight . fig8 shows an exemplary arrangement of the optical waveguide element 12 , the laser diode 1 , and the photodiode 11 for detecting a servo error signal . the polarization direction of the light emitted from the laser diode 1 is in parallel with the y - axis . on the other hand , the magneto - optical signal detecting light has its polarization plane rotated by 1 ° to 2 ° due to the kerr effect . however , the rotation amount is small ; therefore , it is desired that the polarized components having a polarization direction of ± 45 ° with respect to the polarization direction of the light focused onto the magneto - optical disks are detected and a differential signal is detected . as shown in fig8 when the optical waveguide element 12 is positioned so as to form an angle of 45 ° with respect to the x - axis , a te - mode and a tm - mode of the optical waveguide element 12 correspond to the polarized components having a direction of ± 45 ° with respect to the polarization direction of the light emitted from the laser diode , whereby a reproduced signal with a high s / n can be obtained . fig1 shows an exemplary arrangement of the package 19 of the optical pickup device shown in fig1 . the polarization direction of the light emitted from the laser diode 1 is in parallel with the x - axis and has a far - field pattern spreading in the y - axis direction . as described above , in the optical pickup device of the present invention , the beam splitter is positioned between the collimating lens and the holographic optical element working as a diffracting element , instead of being positioned between the objective lens and the collimating lens , whereby a part of light returning from the magneto - optical disk is guided into the optical waveguide element in the package including the light source without passing through the diffracting element , and a magneto - optical signal is detected . because of the above arrangement , a small optical waveguide element having outstanding productivity can be used in place of a large expensive wollaston prism , resulting in a small and light - weight optical pickup device . in addition , since it is not required that the objective lens is positioned at a certain distance from the deflective mirror and that the half mirror plate of the composite mirror is designed so as to have large thickness , the resulting optical pickup device can be made thinner . furthermore , the beam splitter can be more readily fabricated at lower cost by using a mirror plate and a triangular prism , compared with the composite mirror using a half mirror plate in a wedge shape requiring higher processing accuracy . when the beam splitter is provided with a polarization characteristic , a signal quality can be improved by the effect of kerr rotation angle multiplication . furthermore , by designing the mirror plate so as to have large thickness and providing an antireflection film and a light scattering film on a part of the mirror , light emitted from the light source and reflected by the mirror plate surface can be prevented from being incident upon the collimating lens and is focused onto the magneto - optical disk surface to be stray light ; therefore , the distance between the collimating lens and the objective lens can be shortened without degrading a signal quality ; as a result , an optical pickup device can be made smaller and more light - weight . in this case , when the aperture diaphragm is provided in the optical path between the light source and the beam splitter , the spreading angle of the light emitted from the light source can be limited . therefore , an optical pickup device can be miniaturized without degrading a signal quality . according to the present invention , polarized beam separation for detecting a magneto - optical signal is performed by using a small optical waveguide element including a microlens , a prism , and a polarized beam splitting portion of optical waveguide type . the light is coupled to the optical waveguide element by prism coupling , so that the problem related to the fluctuation of a wavelength of a laser beam , caused when using a laser diode as a light source , can be solved . when the boundary between two optical waveguide elements with different structures is formed as a tapered coupling portion whose thickness is changed in a tapered shape , and a light beam passes through the boundary so as to travel diagonally across it , the following advantage can be obtained : each polarized beam is refracted with a different refractive angle from each other because the refractive index of the respective optical waveguide elements is varied depending upon the polarization direction , and polarized beam separation with a high extinction ratio can be performed . furthermore , by forming two or more boundaries and allowing a light beam to pass through these boundaries , the difference in refractive angle of each polarized beam can be made large , and an optical waveguide length can be shortened . still furthermore , a microlens is provided on the upper face of the prism so as to be integrated therewith , an optical waveguide element can be made smaller . various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention . accordingly , it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein , but rather that the claims be broadly construed .",6
"the following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the disclosure . various modifications to the embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art , and the generic principles herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure . thus , the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown , but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein . referring to fig1 , a uwb modulating system , in particular a uwb transmitter 100 , is schematically illustrated according to an embodiment of the present disclosure . adopting a pulse position modulation ( ppm ) technique , the uwb transmitter 100 is adapted to receive a data stream , for example in the form of a modulated digital signal sb carrying a stream of bits b i , generated by a binary source included in a control block 105 , and to generate a corresponding train of modulated uwb pulse signals . each bit b i can take a high logic value “ 1 ” ( for example , associated to the value of a supply voltage vcc ), and a low logic value “ 0 ” ( for example , associated with a ground voltage gnd ). the train of modulated uwb pulse signals , conveying the information carried by the data stream , i . e . by the modulated digital signal sb , is then radio - transmitted by means of an antenna 110 . the correlation between bit values b i and uwb pulse signals is established by the modulation technique that is adopted for modulating the digital signal sb . according to the ppm technique , the position of the generic uwb pulse signal depends on the value , “ 1 ” or “ 0 ”, of the corresponding bit b i in the data stream . adopting instead a pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) technique , it is the amplitude of the generic uwb pulse signal that depends on the value assumed by the corresponding bit b i . the uwb transmitter 100 includes a uwb pulser 115 , having a first input terminal coupled to an output terminal of a driver circuit block 120 fed by the modulated digital signal sb , a second input terminal coupled to an output terminal of a sine wave generator block 125 , and an output terminal coupled to an input terminal of an output stage circuit 130 , having an output terminal coupled to the antenna 110 . the driver circuit block 120 and the sine wave generator block 125 have input terminals coupled to the control block 105 . when the uwb transmitter 100 has to transmit information , the driver circuit block 120 receives the data stream , i . e ., the digital signal sb modulated adopting , for example , a ppm technique , and generates a corresponding signal adapted to drive the uwb pulser 115 . in particular , the driver circuit block 120 generates a corresponding square wave signal rp . moreover , the sine wave generator block 125 generates a sinusoidal signal sc of frequency fc ; preferably , the sine wave generator block 125 is adapted to generate a sine wave voltage signal having a frequency fc variable ( in a continuous or discrete way ) within a predetermined frequency range , the frequency value being for example established by the control block 105 . the uwb pulser 115 includes a pulse generator 140 , controlled by the driver circuit block 120 , and adapted to generate a signal pulse of carefully selected shape , for example a nearly - gaussian pulse ig , as will be more clear in the following description . the uwb pulser 115 further includes a signal multiplier block 150 , having a first input terminal coupled to the output terminal of the sine waves generator block 125 for receiving the sinusoidal signal sc , and a second input terminal coupled to the pulse generator 140 for receiving the nearly - gaussian pulse ig . the multiplier block 150 further includes an output terminal for providing a uwb signal pulse pv , given by the product of the sinusoidal signal sc by the nearly - gaussian pulse ig . an output stage circuit 130 allows coupling the output of the uwb pulser 115 with the antenna 110 , without degrading the spectra of the uwb signal pulse pv . alternatively , a binary phase shift keying modulation ( bpsk ) technique may be adopted : the data stream is provided to the sine wave generator block 125 in the form of a modulated digital signal sb ′ carrying a stream of bits b ′ i , and the sine wave generator block 125 is driven by the control block 105 in such a way to modify the phase of the sinusoidal signal sc depending on the values assumed by the bit b ′ i of the modulated digital signal sb ′. the qualitative trend of a uwb signal pulse pv generated by the uwb pulser 115 as a function of time is illustrated in fig2 a . the uwb signal pulse is composed by a sinusoidal wave of frequency fc enveloped by a nearly - gaussian pulse , and lasts some nanoseconds ( being its bandwidth higher than 500 mhz ). as known in the art , the spectrum of a sinusoidal wave enveloped by a gaussian pulse is a gaussian pulse too , having a center frequency ( i . e ., the frequency corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the gaussian pulse ) that corresponds to the frequency of the sinusoidal wave ; neglecting the low - amplitude , side portions of the gaussian spectrum , the spectral width of the resulting signal can be considered as confined . similarly , the spectrum of the sinusoidal wave signal enveloped by the nearly - gaussian pulse is given by the spectrum of the nearly - gaussian pulse , shifted in frequency and centered at the frequency of the sinusoidal wave signal , as illustrated in fig2 b ; the closer the nearly - gaussian pulse resemble a gaussian pulse , the more the spectrum pf of the uwb signal pulse pv is gaussian . fig2 b shows a diagram of the power spectral density of the spectrum pf versus frequency . since the duration in time of the uwb signal pulse pv is less than one nanosecond , the spectrum pf has a corresponding width of several ghz . for being compatible with the fcc rules , the spectrum pf has to be restricted within a spectral mask sm that begins at the frequency of 3 . 1 ghz and ends at the frequency of 10 . 6 ghz . moreover , within this spectral mask , the power spectral density must have a higher limit value equal to − 41 dbm / mhz . by acting on the sine waves generator block 125 , the control block 105 is capable to vary the frequency fc , shifting the entire spectrum pf . in a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure , the shape of the nearly - gaussian pulse ig ( i . e ., the uwb signal pulse envelope ) can be varied , so as to adjust the shape of the spectrum pf . in particular , according to an embodiment of the present disclosure , by properly modifying the square wave signal rp the shape of the nearly - gaussian pulse ig can be varied ; to this end , the control block 105 acts ( control line 170 ) on the driver circuit block 120 so as to modify the square wave signal rp . the applicant has found that for generating a pulse of a predetermined shape , an advantageous solution consists of properly stimulating the input of a circuit having a non - linear transfer characteristic , which shape closely approximates , as far as possible , the shape of the desired pulse . for this reason , in order to generate a nearly gaussian pulse it is expedient to exploit a circuit whose transfer characteristic has a shape that approximates a gaussian . for better understanding the previous statements , reference will be now made to fig4 a - 4d , wherein the behavior of a circuit having a transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ) ( x represents a generic input of the circuit , and y a generic output thereof ) with a nearly gaussian shape is analyzed . as can be seen in fig4 a , the nearly gaussian shape of the transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ) is obtained by the overlap of two non - linear transfer characteristics , each one having the shape of a hyperbolic tangent : y = ng ( x )= a ( tan h ( x + w )− tan h ( x − w )), ( 1 ) where a is an amplitude parameter and w is a width parameter . the amplitude parameter a establishes the amplitude of the transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ). the width parameter w establishes the shape and the width of the transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ), as illustrated in fig4 b , wherein a family of transfer characteristics y = ng ( x ) is depicted , depending on different values of the width parameter w : the higher the value of the width parameter w , the wider the shape of the transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ). turning now to fig4 c , the effects of an input x variation on the output y are illustrated according to a first example , where it is assumed that the input x varies depending on time t ( i . e ., x = x ( t )) within an interval of values δx . according to this first example , the input x ( t ) is a periodic generically rectangular signal of frequency 1 / t between a lower value xl and a higher value xh , wherein the difference between the higher value xh and the lower value xl is equal to the interval δx . moreover , the input x ( t ) has a rise time tr ( i . e ., the time it takes for x ( t ) to rise from xl to xh ) equal to the fall time tf ( i . e ., the time it takes for x ( t ) to fall from xh to xl ). the output y varies over time , i . e . y = y ( t ), and is in particular a periodic signal having a period t / 2 ( i . e ., half the period of the input x ( t )). the output y ( t ) consists of a train of nearly gaussian pulses each having the same shape as the transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ), but , in general , a different duration . more particularly , the output y ( t ) comprises nearly gaussian pulses in correspondence of the rising and falling edges of the input x ( t ); said nearly gaussian pulses thus have , a time duration equal to the rise / fall times tr / tf . by varying , particularly increasing the rise / fall times tr / tf , as is illustrated in fig4 d , the time durations of the nearly gaussian pulses of the output y ( t ) are accordingly varied , particularly increased . referring to fig3 a , a detailed circuit diagram of the uwb pulser 115 is illustrated . as previously described , the uwb pulser 115 consists of a pulse generator 140 and a multiplier block 150 . the pulse generator 140 comprises a first and a second npn differential pairs , one having the output terminals cross - coupled to the output terminals of each other . more particularly , the first differential pair comprises two npn bipolar transistors q 1 , q 2 , and the second differential pair comprises two npn bipolar transistors q 3 , q 4 . the transistors q 1 and q 2 have the emitter terminals coupled to each other , and further coupled to a first biasing current generator , supplying a continuous current iee 1 . the transistors q 3 and q 4 have the emitter terminals coupled to each other , and further coupled to a second biasing current generator supplying a continuous current iee 2 . the base terminals of the transistors q 1 and q 3 are coupled to the output terminal of the driver circuit block 120 , schematized in the drawing as a voltage signal generator generating an input voltage signal vin series — coupled to a bias voltage generator generating a continuous ( dc ) voltage vb ; the collector terminal of the transistor q 1 is coupled to the collector terminal of the transistor q 4 , forming a circuital node n 1 . the transistor q 2 has the base terminal coupled to a bias voltage generator supplying a second dc voltage vb 1 , and the collector terminal coupled to the collector terminal of the transistor q 3 , forming a circuital node n 2 . the base terminal of the transistor q 4 is coupled to a bias voltage generator generating a third dc voltage vb 2 . the multiplier block 150 comprises a third and a fourth npn differential pairs coupled to each other . the third differential pair comprises two npn bipolar transistors q 5 , q 6 , and the fourth differential pair comprises two npn bipolar transistors q 7 , q 8 . the transistors q 5 and q 6 have the emitter terminals coupled to each other and further coupled to the circuital node n 1 ; the transistors q 7 and q 8 have the emitter terminals coupled to each other and further coupled to the circuital node n 2 . moreover , the base terminal of the transistor q 5 is coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 8 , and the base terminal of the transistor q 6 is coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 7 . both the third and the fourth differential pairs are driven by the sinusoidal voltage signal sc , provided by the sine wave generator block 125 in a differential way . more particularly , the sinusoidal voltage signal sc is applied between the base terminal of the transistor q 5 ( positive input terminal ) and the base terminal of the transistor q 6 ( negative input terminal ). consequently , the sinusoidal voltage signal sc is also applied between the base terminal of the transistor q 8 ( positive input terminal ) and the base terminal of the transistor q 7 ( negative input terminal ). the transistors q 5 and q 7 have the collector terminals coupled to each other , defining a first output node no 1 of the uwb pulser 115 . in a similar way , the transistors q 6 and q 8 have the collector terminals one coupled to each other , defining a second uwb pulser output node no 2 . a current - to - voltage converter 155 is further provided , attached to the output nodes no 1 and no 2 , including a first and a second resistors r 1 and r 2 , both having a resistance value rc . the first resistor r 1 is coupled between the first output node no 1 and a terminal providing the supply voltage vcc , the second resistor r 2 is coupled between the second output node no 2 and a terminal providing the supply voltage vcc . a differential pair of npn bipolar transistors exhibits a non - linear transfer characteristic ( expressing the differential output current id as a function of the differential input voltage vd ), having the shape of a hyperbolic tangent : wherein ibias is the current biasing the differential pair , α is a proportionality parameter including the saturation current of the transistors , and vt is the thermal voltage . it is pointed out that for small input voltages vd ( in particular , sufficiently smaller than 2vt ), the transfer characteristic ( 2 ) is almost linear , while for large values of vd the non - linearities of the npn bipolar transistors reduce the gain of the differential pair and cause the transfer characteristic to bend , thereby obtaining the hyperbolic tangent shape . the behavior of the pulse generator 140 of fig3 a is adapted to generate nearly - gaussian ( current ) pulses ig . in fact , taking account of equation ( 2 ) above , defining with ig 1 the current flowing from the emitter terminals of the transistors q 5 and q 6 to the node n 1 , and defining with ig 2 the current flowing from the emitter terminals of the transistors q 7 and q 8 to the node n 2 , the differential output current ig = ig 1 − ig 2 of the pulse generator 140 is equal to : wherein ic 1 , ic 2 , ic 3 , ic 4 are the collector currents of the transistors q 1 , q 2 , q 3 , q 4 , respectively . vid 1 , 2 is the differential input voltage of the first differential pair , and vid 3 , 4 is the differential input voltage of the second differential pair . since : wherein the input signal vin ( representing the square wave signal rp generated by the driver circuit block 120 ) is a square wave signal of period t having rise times tr and fall times tf , the equation ( 3 ) becomes : which resembles equation ( 1 ). the value of the width parameter w of equation ( 1 ) depends on how much the biasing of the transistors q 1 , q 2 , q 3 , q 4 unbalances the corresponding two differential pairs . the value of the width parameter w is established in equation ( 5 ) by properly setting the voltages vb , vb 1 and vb 2 according to the following relationships : since equation ( 5 ) resembles equation ( 1 ), the pulse generator 140 has a transfer characteristic having a nearly gaussian shape . thus , the pulse generator 140 is adapted to generate a nearly gaussian pulse . the multiplier block 150 , having a “ gilbert cell ” circuital architecture , is characterized by the following transfer characteristic : io 1 and io 2 are the output currents of the multiplier block 150 , given by ic 5 + ic 7 and ic 6 + ic 8 , respectively ; ic 5 , ic 6 , ic 7 and ic 8 are the collector currents of the transistors q 5 , q 6 , q 7 and q 8 , respectively ; the differential output current of the multiplier block 150 , i . e ., io 1 − io 2 , corresponds to the uwb ( current ) signal pulse . defining with vo 1 and vo 2 the voltages at the first and second output nodes no 1 , no 2 , respectively , and thanks to the presence of the first and second resistors r 1 , r 2 , the differential output voltage of the uwb pulser 115 , taken between the first output node no 1 ( positive terminal ) and the second output node no 2 ( negative terminal ) results equal to ( supposing that r 1 = r 2 = rc ): vo 1 − vo 2 = vcc − rc · io 1 −( vcc − rc · i 02 )= rc ·( io 2 − io 1 ), ( 8 ) by imposing iee 1 = iee 2 = iee , equation ( 10 ) can be rewritten in the following way : as can be seen observing equation ( 11 ), the differential output voltage of the uwb pulser 115 depends both on the input voltage signal vin ( representing the square wave signal rp generated by the driver circuit block 120 ) and on the sinusoidal voltage signal sc . moreover , when the sinusoidal voltage signal sc has a low amplitude , where by “ low amplitude ” there is intended sufficiently lower than the thermal voltage vt , the previous equation can be simplified . in fact , assuming that : where vm is the amplitude of the voltage signal sc , and assuming that : pv = vo ⁢ ⁢ 1 - vo ⁢ ⁢ 2 ≅ α 2 · rc · iee · vm 2 ⁢ vt · [ tanh ⁡ ( vin + vb - vb ⁢ ⁢ 2 2 ⁢ vt ) - tanh ⁡ ( vin + vb - vb ⁢ ⁢ 1 2 ⁢ vt ) ] · sin ⁡ ( 2 ⁢ π · fc · t ) , ( 14 ) where the differential output voltage vo 1 - vo 2 of the uwb pulser 115 corresponds to the uwb voltage signal pulse pv . in fact , as can be seen by equation ( 14 ), the uwb voltage signal pulse pv generated by the uwb pulser 115 is a sinusoidal wave enveloped by a nearly - gaussian pulse . as previously mentioned , for being adapted to be exploited in a transmission system , the uwb voltage signal pulse pv has to be compatible with the strict limitations imposed by the regulatory authorities like the fcc . in this case , the extension of its spectrum pf has to be restricted within the spectral mask sm . by neglecting possible aliasing effects , an approximated expression of the envelope of the fourier transform of the module of the uwb voltage signal pulse pv is : wherein vmax is the highest voltage that the square wave signal rp assumes . from the previous equation , an inverse proportionality relation exists between the − 10 db ( in respect with the frequency fc ) band bw of the uwb voltage signal pulse pv and the rise times tr of the input voltage signal vin ( i . e ., the rise time tr of the rectangular voltage pulses of the square wave signal rp ): by making explicit the depending of vmax on tr and w , the following relationship is obtained : bw = 2 ⁢ v ⁢ max π · vt · tr · ln ⁢ 10 2 ⁢ ( w + 1 2 ) . ln ( b - a 2 + ( b - a 2 ) 2 - 1 ) , ( 17 ) a = ⅇ 2 ⁢ w - ⅇ - 2 ⁢ w p · tanh ⁡ ( w ) ; b = ⅇ 2 ⁢ w + ⅇ - 2 ⁢ w , ( 18 ) with p that is a ratio term determining the value of vmax that allows generating a gaussian pulse having a precision p on the side portions thereof . in this way , by varying the rise times tr of the rectangular voltage pulses of the square wave signal rp generated by the driver circuit block 120 , it is possible to vary the bandwidth bw of the uwb voltage signal pulse pv in a reliable way . referring now to fig3 b , an unbalancing circuit for providing the dc vb , vb 1 and vb 2 to the pulse generator 140 in such a way to unbalance the differential pairs q 1 , q 2 and q 3 , q 4 according to equation ( 6 ) is depicted . more particularly , the input voltage signal vin ( representing the square wave signal rp ) is provided to the base terminals of the transistors q 1 and q 3 by means of a first coupling capacitor cc 1 , having a first terminal receiving the input voltage signal vin and a second terminal coupled both to the base terminal of the transistor q 1 and to the base terminal of the transistor q 3 . a terminal providing the dc voltage vb is coupled to the second terminal of the first coupling capacitor cc 1 by means of a biasing resistor rb . in the same way , a terminal providing the dc voltage vb 1 is coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 2 by means of a further first biasing resistor rb 1 , and a terminal providing the dc voltage vb 2 is coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 4 by means of a further second biasing resistor rb 2 . moreover , a second and a third coupling capacitors cc 2 , cc 3 are included . the second coupling capacitor cc 2 has a first terminal coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 2 and a second terminal coupled to a terminal providing the ground voltage gnd ; the third coupling capacitor has a first terminal coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 4 and a second terminal coupled to a terminal providing the ground voltage gnd . in case the input voltage signal vin is provided to the to the pulse generator 140 in a differential way , as depicted in fig3 c , and according to an embodiment of the present disclosure , the unbalancing circuit is the same as the one depicted in fig3 b , but with the second terminals of the second and third coupling capacitors that are coupled to each other , and with the input voltage signal vin that is applied between the first terminal of the first coupling capacitor cc 1 ( positive input terminal ) and the second terminals of the second and third coupling capacitors cc 2 , cc 3 ( negative input terminal ). a further embodiment of the unbalancing circuit is depicted in fig3 d , in which , as in the previous case , the input voltage signal vin is provided in a differential way . the input voltage vin is applied between the base terminal of a npn bipolar transistor q 9 ( positive input terminal ) and the base terminal of a further npn bipolar transistor q 10 ( negative output terminal ). the transistor q 9 has the collector terminal coupled to a terminal providing the supply voltage vcc and the emitter terminal coupled to the first terminal of a biasing resistor rb 3 . the biasing resistor rb 3 has a second terminal coupled to the base terminals of the transistors q 1 and q 3 , forming a circuital node nb 1 . a further biasing resistor rb 4 has a first terminal coupled to the node nb 1 , and a second terminal coupled to a biasing current generator providing a continuous current iee 3 . the transistor q 10 has the collector terminal coupled to a terminal providing the supply voltage vcc and the emitter terminal coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 4 , forming a circuital node nb 2 . a biasing resistor rb 5 has a first terminal coupled to the node nb 2 , and a second terminal coupled to a first terminal of a further biasing transistor rb 6 . the biasing resistor rb 6 has the second terminal coupled to the base terminal of the transistor q 2 and to a biasing current generator providing a continuous current iee 4 . the input signal vin is provided to the inputs of the two differential pairs q 1 , q 2 and q 3 , q 4 by means of the transistors q 9 and q 10 , acting as emitter followers . the unbalancing of the differential pairs is accomplished by the voltage drops generated by the passage of the continuous currents iee 3 , iee 4 through the biasing resistors . although the uwb pulser 115 previously described has been implemented using npn bipolar transistors , alternative solutions are possible . for example , similar results can be achieved if each transistor q 1 - q 8 in fig3 a is replaced by a corresponding voltage - controlled current generator g 1 - g 8 , as depicted in fig3 e . from a practical viewpoint , the voltage - controlled current generators may be implemented by mosfets , as depicted in fig3 f . as can be seen , the circuital architecture is the same as that illustrated in fig3 a , with the npn bipolar transistors q 1 - q 8 replaced by n - channel mosfets m 1 - m 8 . mixed solutions are also possible : for example , in fig3 g the uwb pulser 115 comprises a pulse generator 140 realized with npn bipolar transistors and a multiplier block 150 realized with mosfet transistors ; in fig3 h the uwb pulser 115 comprises a pulse generator 140 realized with mosfet transistors and a multiplier block 150 realized with npn bipolar transistors . as previously mentioned , the uwb pulser 115 converts each transition of the square wave signal provided to its input into a corresponding uwb voltage pulse pv . moreover , the time duration of the uwb voltage pulse pv is uniquely determined by the duration of the rise / fall times tr / tf of the square wave signal . since the − 10 db bandwidth bw of the uwb voltage pulse pv is inversely proportional to the time duration of the uwb voltage pulse pv , i . e ., to tr or tf , the performance in terms of speed and temporal coherence of the driver circuit block 120 needs to be carefully controlled ; in particular , it is to be observed that the circuit performances are affected by the fabrication process tolerances . in fig5 , the driver circuit block 120 is depicted according to an embodiment of the present disclosure , in which the duration of the rise / fall times tr / tf is constant . the driver circuit block 120 includes a shift - register 510 , a summing network 520 and a low - pass filter 530 . the shift register 510 is capable to store a number n of bits b i . it receives from the control block 105 a clock signal clk having a repetition period tc , necessary for timing all the operation performed by the driver circuit block 120 , and the modulated digital signal sb . the shift register 510 provides n output bits q 1 , q 2 , . . . , qn carried by corresponding output terminals ( for convenience , the bits and the corresponding terminals providing them are denoted with the same references ) coupled in sequence to n input terminals s 1 , s 2 , . . . , sn of the summing network 520 . data bits b i are fed by the modulated digital signal sb with a frequency 1 / t . the shift register 510 is capable to store an ordinate sequence of n bits , and includes n bistable elements ( for example , d - latches implemented with e 2 cl technology ) timed by the same clock signal clk , one bistable element per bit . moreover , each bistable element of the shift register 510 is coupled to a corresponding one of the output terminals q 1 , q 2 , . . . , qn . the bistable elements are coupled in such a way that the output of a generic bistable element ( except the last ) is coupled to the input of the subsequent bistable element . the bits stored in the shift register 510 moves from the first bistable element ( having the output coupled to the output terminal q 1 ) to the last bistable element ( having the output coupled to the output terminal qn ), passing from a generic bistable element to a subsequent one at each half period tc / 2 of the clock signal clk . since , according to this example , the shift register 510 is implemented with e 2 cl technology , the d - latches included therein have a differential circuit structure , and the logic values “ 1 ”, “ 0 ” are associated with a high logic voltage vh ( e . g ., equal to 275 mv ) and a low logic voltage vi ( e . g ., equal to − 275 mv ), respectively . consequently , also the modulated digital signal has to be properly adapted , by means of a voltage shifter circuit not shown in the figure , before being provided to the input of the shift register 510 . in the starting condition , it is supposed that the modulated digital signal sb and the output bits q 1 , q 2 , . . . , qn are at the low logic voltage v 1 . when the modulated digital signal sb assumes the high logic voltage vh during a half period tc / 2 , at the subsequent half period the output bit q 1 assumes the high logic voltage vh ( i . e ., it assumes the “ 1 ” logic value ). if the modulated digital signal sb is maintained at the high logic voltage vh for at least n / 2 periods tc , the input variation is transferred to all the n output terminals ; consequently , at the end of n / 2 periods tc , all the output bits q 1 , q 2 , . . . , qn are at the high logic voltage vh ( i . e . they are all at the “ 1 ” logic value ). the summing network 520 includes an output terminal providing a sum signal ss to the low - pass filter 530 . the sum signal ss is an analog voltage signal which value is proportional to the number of output bits q 1 , q 2 , . . . , qn that are at the high logic voltage vh : wherein k is a constant parameter . for example , for implementing the function expressed in equation ( 19 ) a number n of npn differential pairs coupled to a same pair of resistors can be used . the sum signal ss takes the highest value when all the output bits q 1 , q 2 , . . . , qn are at the “ 1 ” logic value , and is equal to : fig6 illustrates the time trends of all the signals involved in the generation of a single rectangular voltage pulse of the square wave signal rp , in the exemplary case of a 4 - bit shift register 510 . in this case , the sum signal ss is a rectangular voltage pulse having staircase - like rising / falling edges with rise / fall times tr / tf equal to two times the period tc . the low pass - filter 530 ( that will not be described in detail , because not relevant to the scope of the present disclosure ) includes an output terminal , for providing the square wave signal rp to the uwb pulser 115 . in fact , by providing the sum signal ss to the low - pass filter 530 , the rising / falling edges of the rectangular voltage pulse are smoothed , and their trends become nearly linear , as required for properly driving the uwb pulser 115 . according to a further embodiment of the present disclosure , the driver circuit block 120 is adapted to be controlled by the control block 105 in such a way to vary the duration of the rise / fall times tr / tf and , consequently , to adjust the width of the uwb voltage pulses pv . since the sum signal ss is a rectangular voltage pulse having staircase - like rising / falling edges with rise / fall times tr / tf that depend on the period tc of the clock signal clk , a method for varying the rise / fall times tr / tf consists of directly adjusting the period tc . moreover , the rising / falling edges of the signal rc may be non linear . in fact , referring back to fig4 c and 4d , and considering again the generic input x and the generic output y related by the nearly - gaussian transfer characteristic y = ng ( x ), a non - linear variation of the input x allows to change the shape of the output y ( t ). since the shape variation of a pulse in the time domain implies a corresponding shape variation of its spectrum in the frequency domain , the possibility of having non linear rising / falling edges can be very useful for adjusting the spectrum pf of the uwb voltage pulses pv in a carefully controlled way . for example , a driver circuit block 120 adapted to generate rectangular voltage pulses with non linear rising / falling edges can be implemented by means of a multivibrator circuit , or by properly modifying the contributions of the bits provided by the shift register . according to a further embodiment of the present disclosure , the sine wave generator block 125 ( fig1 ) may generate a signal sc that is the sum of a plurality of ( at least two , more generally ) p of sinusoidal waves sc 1 , sc 2 , . . . scp , of different frequencies fc 1 , fc 2 , . . . , fcp . in this way , the spectrum of the signal sc has a corresponding plurality p of harmonics . if the frequencies fc 1 , fc 2 , . . . , fcp are sufficiently spaced from each other , the spectrum of the uwb signal pulse pv consists of p replicas of the spectrum pf of the nearly - gaussian pulse ig , each replica having a center frequency equal to a corresponding one among the frequencies fc 1 , fc 2 , . . . , fcp . conversely , when the frequencies fc 1 , fc 2 , . . . , fcp are sufficiently close , said p replicas of the spectrum pf are mutually influenced : the resulting spectrum has a wider width with respect to spectrum pf of the nearly - gaussian pulse ig . naturally , in order to satisfy local and specific requirements , a person skilled in the art may apply to the solution described above many modifications and alterations . particularly , although the present disclosure has been described with a certain degree of particularity with reference to preferred embodiment ( s ) thereof , it should be understood that various omissions , substitutions and changes in the form and details as well as other embodiments are possible ; moreover , it is expressly intended that specific elements and / or method steps described in connection with any disclosed embodiment of the disclosure may be incorporated in any other embodiment as a general matter of design choice . the uwb transmitter 100 of fig1 may be utilized in a variety of different types of electronic communications systems such as wireless communications systems contained in a variety of different types of electronic devices such as consumer electronic devices like telephones and portable digital assistants ( pdas ).",7
"to solve the previously - described problems , the present invention generally provides a belt module comprising , see fig2 triple - section guide rails consisting of pairs of rails 5 and 6 rigidly supported at points 3 and 4 within the main body 1 of a reproducing apparatus ; two pairs of rails 7 and 8 provided outwardly of the periphery of belt module 2 and slidably fitted in or engaged with the aforesaid pairs of rails 5 and 6 so as to mount module 2 slidably with respect to the aforesaid rails 5 and 6 ; and reinforcing rails ( not visible in fig2 ) inserted between the first - mentioned pairs of rails 5 and 6 and the second - mentioned pairs of rails 7 and 8 . the aforesaid reinforcing rails are adapted to be slid to a given position on the pairs of rails 5 and 6 , following the movement of module 2 when this last is withdrawn from main body 1 of the reproducing apparatus , such that the reinforcing rails may support the load of a heavy module 2 with the load uniformly applied to the triple - section rail guides . thus , there is no risk that an excessive load would be exerted on a single pair of rails alone . module 2 is so constructed ( see fig3 ) that when in the position withdrawn out of main body 1 of the reproducing apparatus , the module can be rotated about hinges 25 , 25 &# 39 ; towards an operator ( clockwise direction in fig3 ) to provide an opening between the unit itself and the support rails , whereby the belt may be replaced with ease by releasing the roller which holds it in tension . in the event that the surface of the belt is stained due to adherence of toner or dust , or a sheet of copy paper is stuck in the reproducing apparatus , then cleaning of the belt surface or removal of the jammed copy paper from the apparatus is possible with module 2 maintained in the position withdrawn out of main body 1 of the reproducing apparatus . according to the present invention , since module 2 is slidably supported on a pair of rails 5 and 6 , each rigidly supported at two points , all rails are free from deflection even after frequent and repeated operations withdrawing and reinserting module 2 from and into main body 1 of the reproducing apparatus . in addition , the aforesaid rails supported at two points do not interfere with replacement of a belt on module 2 , such replacement being readily accomplished . a detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be given below in conjunction with fig3 through 5 . rail support members 9 provided within the main body 1 of a reproducing apparatus rigidly support two pairs of rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; mounted on main body 1 at points 3 and 4 . the two pairs of rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; are positioned ( see fig4 ) in facing relation to another two pairs of rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; which are fixedly mounted on the outer wall of module 2 , with reinforcing rails 12 and a plurality of bearings 13 being interposed between the respective rail pairs , the reinforcing rails 12 being slidable together with module 2 . thus , triple - section rail guides in combination serve as a support for the unit . this is done for the sake of distributing the load of the heavy module 2 uniformly among those rails . in detail , when module 2 is withdrawn from main body 1 of the reproducing apparatus with the reinforcing rails 12 inserted between the pairs of rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; provided on the main body 1 and the pairs of rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; of module 2 , the extremely heavy module 2 may be maintained out of main body 1 for a long period of time , during which period cleaning of the belt surface or removal of a copy paper stuck in the main body is effected , without risk of an excessive load being inadvertently exerted on rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; and on the rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;, since the reinforcing rails 12 inserted in respective pairs of these rails serve to distribute the load of the heavy module 2 so that it is shared by all the rails . when module 2 is withdrawn from main body 1 , the reinforcing rails 12 in turn are slid along the respective rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; fixed on the main body and stop at a given position on those rails , whereby the load of module 2 is shared among the pairs of rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ;, and the pairs of rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;, as stated above . when module 2 is pushed back into main body 1 , the reinforcing rails 12 are also slidingly returned on the respective rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ;. modular unit 2 is composed of a pair of opposing frames 16 and a plurality of rollers 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 , one of which is a driving roller . the aforesaid pairs of rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; are fixed to rail - attaching members 21 and 21 &# 39 ; projecting from the frames 16 , thereby supporting the module 2 at rest , as well as permitting it to travel back and forth on the rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; by way of the rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;. a belt 22 is trained in tension about the aforesaid plurality of rollers 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 . an adjusting member 23 , such as a jack screw , is threaded radially into the shaft of roller 20 near the end of the shaft . the adjusting member 23 is anchored with respect to the directions of the double - headed arrow in fig4 by means of a screw - support member 24 attached to frame 16 , for purposes of providing the tension in belt 22 . if adjusting member 23 is turned to move shaft 20 toward the screw - support member 24 ( i . e ., the leftward direction of the arrow in fig4 ), then belt 22 will be demountable from module 2 . although in this embodiment a screw is provided for purposes of replacing a used belt by a new one or for tensioning the belt , the adjusting means are not limited to a screw since spring tension may be utilized for tightening or for permitting replacement of belt 22 . modular unit 2 , as set forth , is adapted to be pivotally moved in a manner to provide an opening between the unit itself and the pairs of rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;, after withdrawal from main body 1 . in this embodiment , module 2 is coupled to main body 1 by hinges 25 and 25 &# 39 ; between the rail mounts 21 , 21 &# 39 ; and the unit frame 16 . for retaining or locking module 2 in the position providing an opening between it and the rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; for a long period of time during which replacement of belt 22 trained about the plurality of rollers can be effected , there is provided between rail mounts 21 , 21 &# 39 ; and unit frame 16 , a mechanism for locking module 2 in open position . as shown in fig3 through 5 , an arm 28 is pivotally mounted between brackets 26 and 26 &# 39 ;, which have an l - shape in cross section and are rigidly fastened to unit frame 16 . arm 28 has a pin - engaging cut - away portion 27 near its free end and is normally urged towards frame 16 , i . e ., in the clockwise direction in fig3 . a pin 30 is mounted on a pin support member 31 which is turn is affixed to one end of rail mount 21 , so as to fit in the pin - engaging cut - away portion 27 of the above - mentioned arm . pin 30 and arm 28 are located in spaced relation to each other in a manner to provide a given opening for module 2 with respect to the rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; when the pin and arm are engaged . fig5 illustrates the pivotal movement of modular unit 2 with respect to main body 1 . if module 2 is moved from rest in a direction to create an opening between same and the rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;, as shown in fig5 the free end of arm 28 will come to bear on pin 30 against the action of a spring 29 . when cut - away portion 27 of arm 28 comes into engagement with pin 30 , module 2 will be locked in a position to provide an opening between same and rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;. a shaft 32 passing through module 2 in the transverse direction thereof ( see fig5 ) is held by the frames 16 and has one end which engages the lower face of arm 28 in a manner to normally urge the arm upwardly . shaft 32 is urged in the leftward direction in fig5 under the action of a coil spring 33 . if shaft 32 is manually urged in the direction of the arrows shown adjacent the open -- i . e ., dotted line -- position in fig5 arm 28 is raised up , thereby releasing module 2 from locked position . the modular unit 2 thus constructed and having the belt 22 trained in tension therearound is actuatable by the driving roller when the unit is returned into main body 1 , so as to permit effecting reproduction of an original image . when there arises the necessity of cleaning belt 22 , removing a copy paper stuck in main body 1 or replacing a belt 22 , actuation of module 2 is stopped and it is then withdrawn from main body 1 towards an operator ( in the leftward direction in fig3 ), whereby a copy paper stuck in main body 1 can be removed or cleaning the surface of belt 22 accomplished by rotating the belt by means of a manual drive wheel ( not shown ), module 2 meanwhile being maintained in the withdrawn position . for replacing a used belt 22 by a new one , modular unit 2 is withdrawn from main body 1 and urged in the clockwise direction ( fig3 ) about the hinges 25 and 25 &# 39 ;, to thereby provide a wide opening between the unit and rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;. after arm 28 mounted on unit 2 has been locked by pin 30 , the screw 23 passing through the end of roller shaft 20 ( as shown in fig4 ) is manipulated to move the shaft in the leftward direction of the arrow in fig4 thereby relieving tension on belt 22 , whereby the used belt 22 can be taken away from the unit and replaced by a new one . at completion of belt replacement , screw 23 is manipulated in the counter - direction to exert tension on the fresh belt 22 . for reinserting module 2 in main body 1 , shaft 32 shown in fig5 is manually urged rightward against the force of spring 33 so as to release arm 28 from engagement with pin 30 . then , module 2 , while resting on rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ;, is manually urged toward main body 1 , thereby being returned to its home position . according to the present invention , there are provided triple - section rail guides in combination , which consist of pairs of rails 10 , 10 &# 39 ; and 11 , 11 &# 39 ; fixed on support members 9 at points 3 and 4 provided within main body 1 , reinforcing rails 12 and pairs of rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; mounted on the outer wall of module 2 . the latter pairs of rails are in facing relation to the former pairs of rails by way of the reinforcing rails 12 . in particular , when module 2 is withdrawn from main body 1 and allowed to stand on the extended rails for a long period of time , the load of the extremely heavy modular unit 2 is distributed by the reinforcing members so as to be uniformly applied to respective rails of the triple - section rail guides , without concentration of such a heavy load on one pair of rails only . thus , the respective rails are maintained free from the deflection experienced with the conventional rails supported at one side , without provision of a particularly strong reinforcing member for supporting such rails . furthermore , since module 2 is pivotally movable on the rails 14 , 14 &# 39 ; and 15 , 15 &# 39 ; to afford selective opening between same and main body 1 , these pairs of rails on unit 2 do not interfere with replacement of a belt 22 .",6
"a disk array system including dual active controllers constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in block diagram form in fig3 . in addition to the structure shown in the disk array system of fig1 the system of fig3 includes a dedicated communication link 57 connected between the array controllers 11 and 13 , and an inter - controller communication chip application specific integrated circuit incorporated into each of the controllers , identified by reference numerals 61 and 63 , respectively . the communication link 57 and inter - controller communication chips provide communication between , and resource arbitration and allocation for the dual disk array controllers . fig4 is a block diagram of the inter - controller communication chip incorporated into each of the dual active array controllers 11 and 13 included within the disk array system shown in fig3 . the inter - controller communication chip ( hereafter referred to as the icon chip ) contains all functions necessary to provide high speed serial communication and resource arbitration / allocation between two disk array controllers . the primary application for the icon chip is in disk array systems utilizing redundant disk array controllers . because the redundant controller configuration shares resources ( disk drives and scsi buses ) between two controllers , a method of arbitrating for these common resources must be utilized in order to prevent deadlocks and to maximize system performance . the icon chip contains a hardware implementation of a resource allocation algorithm which will prevent deadlocks and which strives to maximize system performance . in addition to performing resource arbitration / allocation , the icon chip also provides a means of sending / receiving generic multiple byte messages between disk array controllers . the icon chip includes the following logic modules : the microprocessor interface block allows an external microprocessor to configure and monitor the state of the icon chip . configuration and status information are maintained in registers within the icon chip . the configuration , control , and status registers are designed to provide operating software with a wide range of functionality and diagnostic operations . interrupt masking and control are also included in this functional block . the inter - controller communication block contains all structures and logic required to implement the inter - controller communication interface . this block includes the following structures / logic : send state sequencer 201 , receive state sequencer 203 , message send buffer 205 , message receive buffer 207 , status send register 209 , and status receive buffer 211 . these modules work together to form two independent unidirectional communication channels . serialization and deserialization of data packets occurs in send state sequencer 201 and receive state sequencer 203 modules . serial data output from the send state sequencer 201 may be fed into the receiver state sequencer 203 module for a full diagnostic data turnaround . the inter - controller communication block 200 is used to send generic messages and status or to send specific request / grant / release resource messages between two disk array controllers . communication between pairs of icon chips is provided by 6 signals . these signals are defined as follows : table 1______________________________________communication signal descriptionsname type deseription______________________________________ardy / out ` a ` port ready . this output is controlled by the icon ready bit in the control register and is monitored by the alternate controller . brdy / in ` b ` port ready . this input is used to monitor the ready / not ready status of the alternate controller . areq . dat / out ` a ` port request / serial data . this output signal is used to request data transfer and then send serial data to the alternate controller in response to the ` a ` port acknowledge signal . breq . dat / in ` b ` port request / serial data . this input is used to receive serial data from the alternate controller . aack / in ` a ` port acknowledge . this signal is received from the alternate controller as the handshake for a single data bit transfer . back / out ` b ` port acknowledge . this output signal is sent to the alternate controller to control a serial receive data transfer operation . ______________________________________ the resource allocation block 300 contains all structures and logic required to manage up to 8 shared resources between two disk array controllers , referred to as the master and slave disk array controllers . these structures / logic include the resource allocator 301 , two sets of resource request lists ( master / slave ) 303 and 305 , two sets of release resource fifos ( master / slave ) 307 and 309 , two sets of resources granted fifos ( master / slave ) 311 and 313 , and the resource scoreboard comprising resources allocated and resources available blocks 315 and 317 , respectively . the key element in this block is resource allocator 301 . this block consists of a hardware implementation of an intelligent resource allocation algorithm . all other data structures in this block are directly controlled and monitored by the resource allocator 301 . the resource allocator 301 present in the icon chip for the master controller continually monitors the state of the resource request lists 303 and 305 , the release resource fifos 307 and 309 , and resource scoreboard to determine how and when to allocate resources to either controller . the resource allocator 301 present in the icon chip for the slave controller is not active except during diagnostic testing . the controller functions logic 400 provides several board - level logic functions in order to increase the level of integration present on the disk array controller design . this invention encompasses the establishment of a simple communication link and protocol between devices sharing resources , and a unique arbitration algorithm which is used for the management of the shared resources . the communication link and protocol are used to request , grant , and release resources to or from the resource arbiter . the protocol requires the establishment among the devices sharing resources of a single master device , and one or more slave devices . the master / slave distinction is used only for the purposes of locating the active resource allocation logic 300 . although each controller includes resource allocation logic , this logic is only active in the master controller . in the discussion which follows , references to the resource allocation logic 300 and its components will refer to the active resource allocation logic and its components . both master and slave devices retain their peer to peer relationship for system operations . the active resource allocator 301 is implemented in the master device . a device formulates a resource request by compiling a list of resources that are required for a given operation . the resource request is then passed to the resource allocation logic 300 . the resource allocation logic 300 maintains a list of requests for each device in the system , seeking to satisfy all requests quickly and fairly . once the allocation logic can satisfy a particular request , it signals a grant to the requesting device for the resources requested . the device with the granted resource requests has access to the granted resources until it releases them . the release is then performed by sending a release message to the resource allocator to free the resources for consumption by other resource requests . all resource requests , request granting , and request freeing involving a slave device is performed by sending inter - device messages , which include message type and data fields , between the master ( where the active resource allocation logic is located ) and the slave devices using the interface described above . all resource requests , request grants , and request freeing involving only the master device may be done within the local to the master device . the resource allocation logic 300 located in the arbitrarily assigned master device includes a resource allocation algorithm and associated data structures for the management of an arbitrary number of shared resources between an arbitrary number of devices . the data structures and algorithm for sharing resources are discussed below . for each device which requires shared resource management , a request queue , or list of resource requests , of arbitrary depth is maintained by the master device ( master and slave request lists 303 and 305 ). associated with each of the device request queues are two count values , a list age ( which indicates the relative age of a device request queue with respect to the other request queues ) and a request age ( which indicates the relative age of the oldest entry in a single device &# 39 ; s request queue with respect to other entries in the same request queue ). in addition to the count values associated with each device request queue , two boolean flags are also maintained ; a request stagnation flag and a list stagnation flag . request stagnation true indicates that the relative age of a device &# 39 ; s oldest resource request has exceeded a programmable threshold value . list stagnation true indicates that the relative age of a device &# 39 ; s request queue with respect to other devices &# 39 ; request queues has exceeded a programmable threshold value . stagnation ( request or list ) is mutually exclusive between all devices , only one device can be in the stagnant state at any given time . the master device also maintains the current state of resource allocation and reservation by tracking &# 34 ; resources available &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; resources reserved &# 34 ;. &# 34 ; resources available &# 34 ; indicates to the resource allocation algorithm which resources are not currently in use by any device and are not currently reserved for future allocation . any resources contained within the &# 34 ; resources available &# 34 ; structure ( resources available block 317 ) are therefore available for allocation . &# 34 ; resources reserved &# 34 ; indicates to the resource allocation algorithm which resources have been reserved for future allocation due to one of the devices having entered the stagnant state ( request stagnation or list stagnation true ). once a device enters the stagnant state , resources included in the stagnant request are placed into the &# 34 ; reserved resources &# 34 ; structure ( resource reserved block 315 ) either by immediate removal from the &# 34 ; resources available &# 34 ; structure , or for resources currently allocated , at the time they are released or returned to the resource pool ) and kept there until all resources included in the stagnant request are available for granting . stagnation ( request or list ) is mutually exclusive between all devices ; only one device can be in the stagnant state at any given time . the last two data structures used by the resource allocation algorithm are pointers to the currently selected device ( generically termed turn and listselect ) which is having it &# 39 ; s resource request queue being searched for a match with available resources . resource allocation fairness is provided using the above - defined data structures . the request stagnation flag as previously described is used to ensure fairness in granting resource requests within a single device . for example , assuming random availability of resources , a device which requests most resources in groupings of two could starve it &# 39 ; s own requests for groupings of five resources from the same resource pool unless a mechanism for detecting and correcting this situation exists . the request age counts with their associated thresholds ensure that resource requests within a single device will not be starved or indefinitely blocked . the list stagnation flag is used to ensure fairness in granting resource requests between devices . for example , a device which requests resources in groupings of two could starve another device in the system requesting groupings of five resources from the same resource pool . the list age counts with their associated thresholds ensure that all devices &# 39 ; requests will be serviced more fairly and that a particular device will not become starved waiting for resource requests . two modes of operation are defined for the resource allocation algorithm : normal mode and stagnant mode . under normal mode of operation , no devices have entered the stagnant state and the algorithm uses the turn pointer in a round - robin manner to systematically examine each of the device &# 39 ; s request queues seeking to grant any resources which it can ( based on resource availability ) with priority within a device request queue based on the relative ages of the request entries . upon transition to the stagnant mode ( a device has enter the stagnant state ), the turn pointer is set to the stagnant device and the resource allocation algorithm will favor granting of the request which caused the stagnant state by reserving the resources included in the stagnant request such that no other device may be granted those resources . although the turn pointer is effectively frozen to the stagnant device , other device request queues and other entries within the stagnant device &# 39 ; s request queue will continue to search for resource matches based on what is currently available and not reserved using the secondary list pointer ( listselect ). the actual resource grant operation includes the removal of granted resources from the &# 34 ; resources available &# 34 ; structure along with the clearing of &# 34 ; resources reserved &# 34 ; structure ( if the resource grant was for a stagnant request ). resource freeing or release operations are accomplished simply by updating the &# 34 ; resources available &# 34 ; structure . the following is an implementation of the algorithm using the &# 34 ; c &# 34 ; programming language for a sample case of a master and a single slave device with the following characteristics : as stated earlier , the number of devices , number of shared resources , and queue depth are strictly arbitrary . the functionality contained and implied by this algorithm is implemented in the device sharing the resources designated the master . the description describes the service poll used to look for a resource request to be granted from any controller . the release operation is simply provided by allocating the resources to be released to the channels available variable . although this example implementation uses the &# 34 ; c &# 34 ; programming language , the implementation may take any form , such as other programming languages , hardware state machine implementations , etc . __________________________________________________________________________void resource . sub .-- allocation . sub .-- algorithm ( void ) /* beginresourceallocation algorithm */ int service . sub .-- loops ; resource . sub .-- operation * stagnant . sub .-- operation ;/* while (( q . sub .-- head . sub .-- is . sub .-- not . sub .-- empty ( slave . sub .-- list )) & amp ;& amp ; ( q . sub .-- head . sub .-- is . sub .-- not . sub .-- empty ( master . sub .-- list )))*/ for ( service . sub .-- loops = 0 ; service . sub .-- loops & lt ; 4 : service . sub .-- loops ++) { if ( service . sub .-- loops == 0 ) { if ((! master . sub .-- request . sub .-- stagnation ) & amp ;& amp ; (! master . sub .-- list . sub .-- stagnation ) & amp ;& amp ; (! slave . sub .-- request . sub .-- stagnation ) & amp ;& amp ; (! ! slave . sub .-- list . sub .-- stagnation )) { if ( last . sub .-- serviced == master ) turn = slave ; else turn = master ; } } if ( turn == master ) { if (!

"in the following description of the drawings , identical reference signs are used for the same or functionally equivalent components . fig1 shows an euv radiation generating apparatus 1 that includes a driver laser device 2 , a beam guiding device 3 ( beam guiding chamber ), and a vacuum chamber 4 . a focusing device in the form of a focusing lens 6 is arranged in a vacuum environment formed in the vacuum chamber 4 to focus a co 2 laser beam 5 in a target region b . the euv radiation generating apparatus 1 shown in fig1 substantially corresponds to the design described in us 2011 / 0140008 a1 , which is incorporated into the content of this application by reference in its entirety . the illustration of measuring devices for monitoring the beam path of the laser beam 5 was dispensed with for reasons of clarity . as an alternative or in addition to a focusing lens 6 , the focusing device can have at least one reflecting optical element . the driver laser device 2 includes a co 2 beam source and a plurality of amplifiers for producing a laser beam 5 with a high radiation power (& gt ; 1 kw ). reference is made to us 2011 / 0140008 a1 for a detailed description of examples of possible configurations of the driver laser device 2 . from the driver laser device 2 , the laser beam 5 is deflected by a plurality of deflection mirrors 7 to 11 in the beam guiding chamber 3 and a further deflection mirror 12 in the vacuum chamber 4 onto the focusing lens 6 , which focuses the laser beam 5 in the target region b , in which tin is arranged as a target material 13 . instead of the focusing lens 6 , one or more mirrors for focusing the co 2 laser beam into the target region b can also be used . it is understood that other materials to tin can also be used as target material 13 . the target material 13 is hit by the focused laser beam 5 and , in the process , converted into a plasma state , which serves for the generating of euv radiation 14 . the target material 13 is supplied to the target region b with the aid of a provisioning device ( not shown here ), which guides the target material 13 along a predetermined path which crosses the target region b . in respect of details relating to the provision of the target material , reference is likewise made to the us 2011 / 0140008 a1 . an adjustment device 15 is arranged in a beam guiding space in the beam guiding chamber 3 , the adjustment device 15 serving to set a beam diameter d of the laser beam 5 and an aperture angle α ( cf . fig5 b ) of the laser beam 5 . the adjustment device 15 includes a first mirror 16 which has a first , convexly curved reflecting surface 16 a . the laser beam 5 that is incident on the first mirror 16 in collimated fashion is reflected by the first reflecting surface 16 a as a divergent laser beam 5 and it is incident on a second mirror 17 , which has a second , concavely curved reflecting surface 17 a . the laser beam 5 leaves the second mirror 17 as a converging laser beam 5 and it is incident on a third mirror 18 , which has a third , convexly curved reflecting surface 18 a . the laser beam 5 is reflected by the third mirror 18 as a divergent laser beam 5 and it is incident on a fourth mirror 19 , which has a fourth , concavely curved reflecting surface 19 a . the radii of curvature of the four reflecting surfaces 16 a - 19 a of the four mirrors 16 - 19 are matched to one another in such a way that the laser beam 5 is reflected in the manner described further above , e . g ., that the laser beam 5 is divergent between the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 , convergent between the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 , and divergent between the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 . in the shown example , the first mirror 16 and the fourth mirror 19 are embodied as off - axis parabolic mirrors , e . g ., the first reflecting surface 16 a and the fourth reflecting surface 19 a each form an off - axis segment of an ( elliptical ) paraboloid . the term “ off - axis ” means that the reflecting surfaces 16 a , 19 a do not contain the axis of rotation of the paraboloid ( and hence do not contain the vertex of the paraboloid either ). the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 are embodied as ellipsoid mirrors , e . g ., the reflecting surfaces 17 a , 18 a each form a segment of an ellipsoid . in principle , the reflecting surfaces 17 a , 18 a may form symmetric segments of an ellipsoid , and so a respective segment of the ellipsoid has two equal focal lengths or back focal lengths for the incident laser beam and for the emerging laser beam . in the example shown below in fig2 a and 2b , the second mirror 17 is a nonsymmetrical ellipsoid mirror ( also referred to as an off - axis ellipsoid mirror ), in which the reflecting surface 17 a forms a segment of an ellipsoid which does not extend with rotational symmetry with respect to one of the major axes of the ellipsoid indicated in fig2 b , the reflecting surface 17 a forming a portion of said ellipsoid . the same applies to the reflecting surface 18 a of the third mirror 18 . the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 each have a different back focal length and focal length for the incident laser beam 5 and for the emerging laser beam 5 . the use of the second mirror 17 and of the third mirror 18 in the form of off - axis ellipsoid mirrors facilitates more degrees of freedom in relation to the design and the spacings of the four mirrors 16 to 19 than is the case for symmetrical ellipsoid mirrors . for setting the beam diameter d and the aperture angle α of the laser beam 5 , the adjustment device 15 includes a movement device 20 which is subsequently described in more detail on the basis of fig2 a . in the shown example , the movement device 20 has a basic body in the form of a carrier plate 21 , on which a ( first ) housing 22 is fastened rigidly , e . g ., by way of a screw - in connection . the housing 22 is embodied in the form of a cylinder with a rectangular base area ( e . g ., in the form of a cuboid ) and has an entrance opening ( not shown here ) at one end , through which the collimated laser beam 5 , which propagates along a beam axis ( x - axis of an xyz - coordinate system ), enters into the housing 22 . attached to the other end of the housing 22 is the first mirror 16 , at the reflecting surface 16 a of which the laser beam 5 emerges through a first opening 23 in the direction of the second mirror 17 which , together with the third mirror 18 , is arranged in a common , cuboid housing 24 . the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 are arranged at a fixed distance a from one another at opposite ends of the common housing 24 , which likewise has a cuboid embodiment . the divergent laser beam 5 enters into the common housing 24 at a second opening 25 ( which is covered in fig2 a ), it is reflected from the second mirror 17 to the third mirror 18 , and leaves the common housing 24 by way of a third opening 26 . the laser beam 5 emerging from the common housing 24 enters into a further housing 28 through a fourth opening 27 ( which is covered in fig2 a ), the fourth mirror 19 being arranged in said further housing . the further housing 28 likewise has a cuboid embodiment and the fourth mirror 19 is attached to one end of the cuboid housing 28 . at the opposite end of the further housing 28 , the laser beam 5 emerges from the further housing 28 , and hence from the adjustment device 15 , at an exit opening . in the example shown in fig2 a and 2b , the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 produce a z - fold of the laser beam 5 that is incident in the adjustment device 15 along the x - direction , i . e ., the laser beam 5 reflected at the second mirror 17 has substantially the same propagation direction as the incident laser beam 5 , i . e ., it extends with a substantially parallel offset to the incident laser beam 5 . accordingly , the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 of the adjustment device 15 produce a further z - fold , i . e ., the laser beam 5 impinging on the third mirror 18 is reflected by the third mirror 18 and fourth mirror 19 in such a way that the laser beam extends substantially parallel to the laser beam 5 impinging on the third mirror 18 . the z - fold at the first mirror 16 and second mirror 17 and the further z - fold at the third mirror 18 and fourth mirror 19 are matched to one another in such a way that the laser beam 5 that is incident into the adjustment device 15 and the laser beam 5 that emerges from the adjustment device 15 extend parallel to one another , i . e ., propagate in the x - direction in the shown example . the z - fold at the first mirror 16 and second mirror 17 , and the further z - fold at the third mirror 18 and fourth mirror 19 are matched to one another in such a way that the laser beam axis 33 a of the laser beam 5 between the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 , and the laser beam axis 33 b between the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 , correspond . if , as in the shown example , the laser beam 5 that is incident into the adjustment device 15 and the laser beam 5 that emerges from the adjustment device 15 extend parallel to one another , an angle of incidence β of the laser beam 5 on the first mirror 16 typically corresponds in this case to an angle of incidence β of the laser beam 5 on the fourth mirror 19 . as a result of the parallel alignment of the respective laser beam axes 33 a , 33 b of the laser beam 5 , the housing 24 with the second mirror 17 and third mirror 18 can be displaced without a beam offset occurring in this case . without such a parallel alignment , a separate actuation of all four mirrors 16 to 19 might be required to compensate a possibly occurring beam offset . in the example shown in fig2 a and 2b , both the common housing 24 and the further housing 28 are mounted on the carrier plate 21 in a movable , more precisely displaceable , manner . the movement device 20 is embodied to move , more precisely displace , the common housing 24 and the further housing 28 independently of one another . for this purpose , a guide plate 29 is fastened to the outer side of the common housing 24 , and it is possible to displace said guide plate along a common displacement direction 30 which corresponds to the longitudinal direction of the guide plate 29 . the guide plate 29 is fastened to the common housing 24 in such a way ( substantially centrally in the shown example ) that , in the case of the displacement along the common displacement direction 30 , the displacement direction 30 forms a displacement axis 30 a at the position at which the laser beam 5 impinges on the second mirror 17 , said displacement axis corresponding to the laser beam axis of the laser beam 5 impinging on the second reflecting surface 17 a of the second mirror 17 . accordingly , the fourth mirror 19 is also fastened to a further guide plate ( not shown in fig2 a ) to displace the further housing 28 along a further displacement direction 31 which , in the shown example , extends parallel to the common displacement direction 30 . the further guide plate is fastened to the further housing 28 in such a way ( substantially centrally in the shown example ) that the further displacement direction 31 , at the position at which the laser beam 5 impinges on the fourth mirror 19 , forms a further displacement axis 31 a , which corresponds to the laser beam axis of the laser beam 5 that impinges on the fourth reflecting surface 19 a of the fourth mirror 19 . the guide plate 29 is mounted in a linearly movable manner between two linear guides 32 a , 32 b that are formed on the carrier plate 21 , said linear guides being illustrated in fig3 a to fig5 a . the same applies to the further guide plate , the illustration of which was dispensed with for reasons of clarity , just like the illustration of further linear guides in fig2 a to fig5 a . the guide plate 29 can be displaced between the two linear guides 32 a , 32 b along the common displacement direction 30 by means of an actuator ( not shown ), for example a linear motor . the further housing 28 can also be displaced between the two further linear guides along the further displacement direction 31 by means of a further actuator , for example a further linear motor . the movement device 20 is embodied to actuate the actuator and the further actuator independently of one another such that the common housing 24 and the further housing 28 can be displaced independently of one another along the common displacement axis 30 a and along the further displacement axis 31 a , respectively . during the movement of the common housing 24 , the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 are displaced together relative to the first mirror 16 and the fourth mirror 19 . during the movement of the further housing 28 , the fourth mirror 19 is displaced relative to the first , stationary mirror 16 . fig2 a shows the movement device 20 in a basic position , in which a focal position f 1 of the first mirror 16 that is embodied as a paraboloid and a first focal position f 2 a of the second mirror 17 that is embodied as ellipsoid correspond . independently of the respective positioning of the adjustment device 15 , a second focal position f 2 b of the second mirror 17 corresponds to a first focal position f 3 a of the third mirror 18 that is likewise embodied as an ellipsoid since the two mirrors are arranged at a constant distance from one another . furthermore , in the basic position , a second focal position f 3 b of the third mirror 18 corresponds to a focal position f 4 of the fourth mirror 19 that is embodied as a paraboloid . the axis of symmetry 34 ( axis of rotation ) of the first ( parabolic ) mirror 16 , on which its focal position f 1 is situated , and the axis of symmetry 35 of the fourth ( parabolic ) mirror 19 , on which its focal position f 4 is situated , are aligned parallel to one another . fig2 b shows the beam profile of the laser beam 5 through the adjustment device 15 in the basic position of the movement device 20 shown in fig2 a . the laser beam 5 that is incident in the adjustment device 15 in collimated fashion emerges from the adjustment device 15 in collimated fashion in the basic position , with the beam diameter d of the emerging laser beam 5 being greater by a factor m relative to the beam diameter d ′ of the laser beam 5 entering into the adjustment device 15 , i . e ., the magnification nominally brought about by the adjustment device 15 is d / d ′= m . when using off - axis ellipsoid mirrors 16 , 17 , the ( magnification ) factor m of the adjustment device 15 emerges as the product of the ( magnification ) factor m 12 =− f 2 a / f 1 of the imaging by the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 , the ( magnification ) factor m 23 =− f 3 a / f 2 b of the imaging by the second mirror 17 and third mirror 18 , and by the ( magnification ) factor m 34 =− f 4 / f 3 b of the imaging by the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 , i . e ., the following applies : where f 1 , f 2 a , f 2 b , f 3 a , f 3 b , f 4 respectively denote the focal length , e . g ., the distance between the respective mirror 16 to 19 , or the respective reflecting surface 16 a to 19 a , and the respective focal position f 1 , f 2 a , f 2 b , f 3 a , f 3 b , f 4 . for the distance d 12 between the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 , in the basic position , d 12 = f 1 + f 2 a applies , for the distance d 23 ( and a ) between the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 , d 23 = f 2 b + f 3 a applies and for the distance d 34 between the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 , d 34 = f 3 b + f 4 applies . the focal lengths f 1 , f 2 a , f 2 b , f 3 a , f 3 b , f 4 of the first mirror 16 to the fourth mirror 19 are dependent on the available installation space and , for example , may lie in the order of magnitude between approximately 500 mm and approximately 1000 mm . if the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 are embodied as symmetrical ellipsoid mirrors , the ( magnification ) factor simplifies as follows : m =− f 4 / f 1 . in this case , the following applies for the distance d 12 between the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 , the distance d 23 ( or a ) between the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 , and for the distance d 34 between the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 : d 12 = f 1 + f 2 , d 23 = f 2 + f 3 and d 34 = f 3 + f 4 . as described further above , symmetrical ellipsoid mirrors have identical focal lengths , i . e . the following applies in this case : f 2 a = f 2 b = f 2 and f 3 a = f 3 b = f 3 . in the basic position , the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 are arranged in such a way that imaging of the incident laser beam 5 by the adjustment device 15 is carried out practically without aberrations since two of the focal positions f 1 , f 2 a , f 2 b , f 3 a , f 3 b , f 4 coincide in each case . in the example shown in fig2 b , the incident laser beam 5 has a beam diameter d ′ of approximately 40 mm . fig3 a and 3b show the movement device 20 and the beam profile through the adjustment device 15 in an upper position of the common housing 24 , in which the further housing 28 has been slightly displaced out of the basic position shown in fig2 a to compensate a parasitic change in divergence of the laser beam 5 , and so the emerging laser beam 5 continues to be collimated . in fig3 a and 3b , the common housing 24 is displaced into an upper position , in which it adjoins the further housing 28 . in the upper position shown in fig3 a , the further housing 28 is therefore arranged at a maximum possible distance from the first mirror 16 or from the housing 22 . in the upper position shown in fig3 a and 3b , the adjustment device 15 produces an emerging , collimated laser beam 5 with a minimum possible beam diameter d , the size of which depends on the possible displacement paths of the movement device 20 and the employed focal lengths and which , for example , may be at approximately 80 % of the magnification factor m produced in the basic position . fig4 a and 4b show the movement device 20 or the beam profile through the adjustment device 15 in a lower position of the common housing 24 , in which the further housing 28 has likewise been slightly displaced out of the basic position shown in fig2 a in order to compensate a parasitic change in divergence of the laser beam 5 and produce a collimated emerging laser beam 5 . in fig4 a and 4b , the common housing 24 is displaced into a lower position , in which the latter adjoins the stationary housing 22 in which the first mirror 16 is arranged . in the lower position shown in fig4 a , the further housing 28 is therefore arranged at a minimum possible distance from the first mirror 16 or from the housing 22 . in the lower position shown in fig4 a and 4b , the adjustment device 15 produces an emerging , collimated laser beam 5 with a maximum possible beam diameter d , the size of which depends on the possible displacement paths of the movement device 20 and the employed focal lengths and which , for example , may lie at approximately 120 % of the magnification factor m produced in the basic position . finally , fig5 a and 5b show the movement device 20 and the beam profile through the adjustment device 15 in a position in which the common housing 24 is positioned like in the basic position shown in fig2 a . in the position shown in fig5 a and 5b , the further housing 28 is displaced along the further displacement axis 31 a into a lower position , in which the further housing 28 adjoins the common housing 24 . in the position shown in fig5 a and 5b , the adjustment device 15 produces a divergent emerging laser beam 5 with approximately the maximum possible divergence , e . g ., the ( half ) aperture angle α of the laser beam 5 is increased by the maximum possible value in relation to the laser beam axis ( x - direction ), wherein the magnitude of the maximum ( half ) aperture angle α , for example , may be on the order of a few milliradians ( mrads ). the aperture angle α and the beam divergence of the laser beam 5 are presented in an exaggerated fashion in fig5 b for elucidation purposes . the ( virtual ) focal position of the divergent laser beam 5 emerging from the adjustment device 15 in fig5 b is at a distance of approximately fifty meters from the fourth mirror 19 in the shown example . the divergence of the laser beam 5 is produced by reducing the distance between the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 in relation to the basic position . as described further above , the specific values for ( half ) the aperture angle α and for the ( virtual ) focal position of the emerging laser beam 5 depend on the employed focal lengths and the possible displacement paths of the movement device 20 . as a result of displacing the further housing 28 downward , the laser beam 5 impinges on the fourth mirror 19 with a smaller beam cross section than is the case in the basic position shown in fig2 a and 2b . accordingly , a nominal magnification of the laser beam 5 is produced in the position shown in fig5 a and 5b , said nominal magnification having a scale which is less than the ( nominal ) magnification factor m in the basic position ( i . e ., d / d ′& lt ; m applies ). by displacing the common housing 24 in the direction of the first mirror 16 , it is possible to increase the imaging scale , and so the latter once again corresponds to the nominal imaging scale m . in the case of such a displacement , the aperture angle α is further enlarged , which may be taken into account for setting the desired aperture angle α . by way of a movement of the further housing 28 along the further displacement axis 31 a into an upper position of the further housing 28 ( not presented pictorially ), the movement device 20 can produce a convergent emerging laser beam 5 , with the ( half ) aperture angle α of the convergent laser beam 5 likewise being of the order of a few milliradians . the focal position of the convergent laser beam 5 emerging from the adjustment device of fig5 b can , for example , likewise have a distance of approximately fifty meters from the fourth mirror 19 . the change in the imaging scale ( d / d ′& gt ; m ) which occurs during the upward displacement of the further housing 28 can be compensated by virtue of increasing the distance between the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 relative to the first mirror 16 , such that a convergent emerging laser beam 5 is produced with a beam diameter d , which corresponds to the nominal imaging scale ( d / d ′= m ). the aperture angle α decreases slightly in the case of such a displacement . in the case of the displacement of the further housing 28 , the emerging laser beam 5 is offset in the y - direction , i . e ., the latter impinges with a lateral offset on the first deflection mirror 9 ( cf . fig1 ) which follows the adjustment device 15 in the beam guiding device 3 . to compensate this beam offset , the first deflection mirror 9 and a further deflection mirror 10 , following the latter in the beam path , may be embodied to be swivelable about a respective tilt axis extending in the z - direction and / or to be displaceable in the y - direction . the tilts and / or the displacements of the deflection mirrors 9 , 10 are matched to one another in such a way that the laser beam 5 impinges on the subsequent deflection mirror 11 at the desired position ( and parallel to the x - direction , i . e . aligned at the correct angle ). it is understood that the compensation of the beam offset may , alternatively or additionally , also be carried out with the help of the further deflection mirrors 11 , 12 , or in any other way , so as to ensure that the laser beam 5 is focused onto the target position b as desired by the focusing lens 6 . only small aberrations occur in the positions of the movement device 20 shown in fig3 a and 3b to fig5 a and 5b and in the position not presented pictorially , in which a convergent laser beam 5 is formed . moreover , the energy distribution of the laser beam 5 is maintained over the beam cross section during the displacement of the second to fourth mirrors 17 , 18 , 19 . the adjustment device 15 described herein , including the first mirror 16 and the fourth mirror 19 , which are embodied as parabolic mirrors , and including the second mirror 17 and the third mirror 18 , which are embodied as ellipsoid mirrors , moreover facilitates a particularly compact realization of the adjustment device 15 , which is therefore particularly advantageous in view of the required installation space . no intermediate focus is produced in the beam path between the four mirrors 16 to 19 in the adjustment device 15 shown in fig2 a and 2b to fig5 a and 5b , in which the reflecting surfaces 16 a , 18 a of the first mirror 16 and the third mirror 18 have convex curvature and in which the second reflecting surface 17 a and the fourth reflecting surface 19 a of the second mirror 17 and of the fourth mirror 19 , respectively , have concave curvature . alternatively , it is also possible to embody the adjustment device 15 in such a way that one , two or three intermediate foci are produced in the beam path between the individual mirrors 16 to 19 , as described below in more detail on the basis of fig6 a , 6b and 6c , which show the adjustment device 15 , respectively , in the basic position , analogously to fig2 a and 2b . in the illustrations shown in fig6 a , 6b and 6c , the first mirror 16 and the fourth mirror 19 are embodied as off - axis paraboloid mirrors , as described further above , and the second mirror 17 and third mirror 18 are embodied as ellipsoid mirrors . in the adjustment device 15 shown in fig6 a , the reflecting surfaces 17 a , 18 a of the second mirror 17 and third mirror 18 each have a concave curvature , while the reflecting surfaces 16 a , 19 a of the first mirror 16 and the fourth mirror 19 each have a convex curvature . in this way , an intermediate focus is produced between the second mirror 17 and third mirror 18 . in the adjustment device 15 shown in fig6 b , the reflecting surface 16 a of the first mirror 16 has a convex curvature , while the reflecting surfaces 17 a to 19 a of the second to fourth mirrors 17 to 19 each have a concave curvature , as a result of which a second intermediate focus is formed between the third mirror 18 and the fourth mirror 19 . in the adjustment device 15 shown in fig6 c , the reflecting surfaces 16 a to 19 a of all four mirrors 16 to 19 each have a concave curvature , as a result of which a third intermediate focus is formed between the first mirror 16 and the second mirror 17 . it is understood that the adjustment devices 15 shown in fig6 a , 6b and 6c may be provided with a movement device 20 which is embodied in the manner described further above in order to set both the beam diameter d and the aperture angle α of the laser beam 5 . it is likewise understood that the movement device 20 may also have an embodiment that differs from the one shown in fig2 a and 2b to fig6 a , 6b and 6c . also , the adjustment device 15 can be used to produce a nominal reduction in size of the laser beam 5 with a reduction scale 1 / m by virtue of reversing the beam direction of the laser beam 5 . the adjustment device 15 with the movement device 20 or the beam guiding device 3 can also be used in a meaningful manner in other optical arrangements than in the euv radiation generating apparatus 1 that is described further above , in which other optical arrangements an adjustment of both the beam diameter d and the aperture angle α of a laser beam 5 is required , in particular in the case of optical arrangements which have a very long beam path or require very high powers . by way of example , such a beam guiding device 3 can be used in a laser processing machine for laser welding and / or laser cutting applications . a number of embodiments of the invention have been described . nevertheless , it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention . accordingly , other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims .",6
"referring to the drawings in detail , a cord reel is denoted generally therein by the numeral 10 . cord reel 10 comprises a housing 12 including a peripheral wall 14 and a radial wall 16 ( fig4 and 5 ). peripheral wall 14 is provided with an aperture thereto at 17 , bounded and reinforced by smoothly rounded jambs 18 , and a handle 19 angularly displaced from the aperture . mounted for rotation within housing 12 is a reel 20 comprising a hub 22 including peripheral hub wall 23 , from which there radiates opposed cheekwalls 24 parallel to radial housing wall 16 . as seen in fig4 and 5 , radial wall 16 has an inwardly turned portion at 26 , this portion being concentrically located within hub 22 and spaced therefrom . inwardly turned portion 26 terminates in a radial flange 28 , the flange having a plurality of notches 29 disposed about the periphery thereof . housing peripheral wall 14 generally closely surrounds the perimeter of cheek walls 24 to preclude access to the interior of the housing 12 therebetween . however , the peripheral wall is outwardly divergent towards aperture 17 , and a shaped fillet 30 locates between upper cheek wall 24 and peripheral wall 14 in the vicinity of aperture 17 , being releasably secured to jambs 18 by screws 31 . it will be appreciated that fillet 30 serves to reinforce peripheral wall 14 in the vicinity of aperture 17 . radial housing wall 16 is integrally formed with a fillet portion similarly shaped to fillet 30 and which secures to the lower end of jambs 18 to close off the housing . hub 22 is divided into upper and lower compartments 32 , 34 respectively by hub radial walls 36 , 38 and 40 , wall 40 being detachable from wall 38 and secured thereto by a plurality of machine screws 42 and spacers 44 . housing radial wall 16 is stepped at 46 and detachable hub radial wall 40 i dimensional to engage behind step 46 , whilst being radially spaced therefrom , so as to prevent hub 22 being withdrawn from housing 12 . antifriction washer 48 locates between flange 28 and the intermediate hub radial wall 38 , permitting reel 20 to rotate freely within housing 12 . a handle 49 is provided to rotate reel 20 . within compartment 34 there locates a plunger 50 which is spring biased upwardly by helical spring 52 . plunger 50 is shaped and located so as to engage a notch 29 when in its upward position , thereby locking reel 20 to preclude the rotation thereof . hub radial wall 36 is windowed at 53 to provide access to upper compartment 32 of hub 22 . window 53 is closed by shutter 54 which is hinged at 56 along one side thereof to hub radial wall 36 . within compartment 32 is located at latch 58 , which is pivotally secured at 60 to radial hub wall 38 by a furcated latch arm 62 . latch 58 is biased towards hinge 56 by a spring 64 . shutter 54 is provided with a downwardly dependent catch 66 which engages latch 58 to retain the shutter in a closed position thereby preventing access to upper compartment 32 of hub 22 . plunger 50 is provided with a stem 68 which projects upwardly through hub radial wall 38 into upper compartment 32 to terminate within the boundary of window 53 adjacent hub radial wall 36 . lateral play of plunger stem 68 is precluded by a surrounding tubular wall 70 therefor mounted from wall 38 . shutter 54 is provided with a small downwardly dependent post 72 which locates so as to bear upon plunger stem 68 when the shutter 54 is in its closed position , and so disengage plunger 50 from notch 29 , thereby unlocking reel 20 so as to permit the rotation thereof . an aperture 74 through hub peripheral wall 23 is provided in general radial alignment with the furcated opening in latch arm 62 , thereby forming a passage from housing 12 into upper compartment 32 . having described the structure of cord reel 10 , the manner of operation thereof will now be described . a standard electrical extension cord 80 having a plug connector 82 and a socket connector 84 at opposed ends thereof has one end which enters housing 12 at aperture 17 and passes into upper compartment 34 via the passage provided by hub wall opening 74 and the furcation of latch arm 62 to float within the compartment , that is to say it is freely moveable within the confines thereof . assuming connector 82 to be nested within hub compartment 32 , as shown in fig4 shutter 54 may be closed and latched into place , thereby capturing connector 82 within compartment 32 and rendering cord 80 inoperably for the purpose of supplying current to an electrical curcuit . as shutter 54 is moved to its latched position , post 72 simultaneously bears upon plunger stem 68 to force plunger 50 downwards out of contact with notch 30 , thereby unlocking reel 20 . cord 80 may now be wound on reel 20 using handle 49 . for as long as shutter 54 remains closed , cord 80 is effectively rendered inoperative . shutter 54 can be opened only by disengaging catch 66 from latch 58 . latch 58 is operable by applying tension to cord 80 , thereby drawing connector 82 into contact with latch arm 62 and causing the latch arm to rotate against the bias of spring 64 . assuming cord 80 to be wound onto reel 20 , tension applied to the cord extending from housing 12 will cause reel 20 to turn , and the cord will be unwound . no tension will be transmitted to connector 82 until cord 80 is essentially unwound from reel 80 . even assuming handle 49 were held to prevent reel 20 from rotating freely , tension applied to cord 80 would be expanded by frictional forces with any more than 2 - 3 turns of cord 80 on the reel . in practice , cord 80 is found to be fully unwound from reel 20 , with apertures 17 and 74 in general radial alignment , prior to catch 66 being released . once connector 82 is accessible , cord 80 becomes operable . by pulling on connector 82 , cord is drawn through aperture 17 into hub 22 and through window 53 until a desired length of cord is obtained to connect plug 80 to a convenience receptacle or the like . the spacing between jambs 18 is such as to permit cord 80 to be drawn readily into and from housing 12 , but to prevent connector 84 from passing into the housing . in the event that it is required to replace cord 80 , fillet 30 is detached from jambs 18 by withdrawing screws 31 , thereby providing an opening of sufficient size to permit the passage of either connector 82 or 84 therethrough . pivot 60 , which retains furcated latch arm 62 in position , is withdrawn , thereby disengaging cord 80 and permitting either connector end 82 or 84 to be threaded through compartment aperture 74 , and a new cord to be inserted in housing 12 . whilst my invention has been particularized in relation to one specific embodiment thereof , it will be appreciated that many departures therefrom may be expedient whilst achieving the same ends , and it is intended that all such departures be encompassed within the scope of my invention

"to enhance sensitivity and wavelength selectivity , infrared sensing arrays may include an integral optical cavity , tuned for the wavelength of interest , for example 9 - 10 μm for thermal imaging of human subjects . the cavity is formed by placing a reflector one quarter wavelength ( λ / 4 ) behind the sensors in the array . ( the reflector is “ behind ” the sensor array in the sense that the reflector is placed on the side of the array that is opposite the side on which the radiation to be sensed is actually incident . in terms of fabrication , on the other hand , the reflector is typically placed over the front side of the sensor chip , while the radiation is incident on the back side .) the reflector may be formed as an extended metal layer , which is deposited on a cap wafer that is then bonded to the wafer on which the sensor array is formed , so that the reflector is positioned at the appropriate distance ( λ / 4 ) from the sensors themselves . in experiments with this configuration , however , the inventors found that because of the machining and thinning of the wafer on which the sensor array is formed , the array tends to warp in the center . consequently , the distance between the sensors and the reflector varies substantially over the area of the array , resulting in substantial variations in the optical cavity length . embodiments of the present invention that are described herein overcome this limitation by attaching an individual optical cavity to each sensor in an array . instead of adding a separate reflector for all ( or a large group ) of the sensors , the individual reflectors are typically created by using the metal and dielectric layers that are deposited integrally on the sensor chip as part of the wafer fabrication process . the individual cavities in this case may be open ( i . e ., they may contain vacuum or air between the sensing element and the reflecting layer ), or they may contain dielectric material that is transparent to the ir wavelengths of interest . because the cavities are fixed to the individual sensors , the desired cavity dimensions are maintained even in the face of warping of the array as a whole . as a result , coupling of the incoming ir radiation to the sensors is enhanced . furthermore , the use of individual reflectors , as opposed to a single , common reflector for multiple sensors , reduces crosstalk between neighboring sensors and thus enhances the resolution of the array . although the embodiments that are described herein refer specifically to tmos sensor designs , the principles of the present invention may similarly be applied to other types of ir sensor arrays . fig1 is a conceptual sectional view of an ir sensor array 20 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . the array comprises multiple sensing elements 21 , each comprising a sensor 22 , such as a tmos sensor , and an individual optical cavity 24 . although this sectional view shows only a part of a single row of sensing elements , in practice the sensing elements are typically arranged in a two - dimensional matrix array , with supporting structures that connect them to the surrounding substrate , as described , for example , in the above - mentioned patent . these structures are omitted here for the sake of simplicity . cavities 24 are formed by reflectors 26 , which are held by support structures 28 at a distance of λ / 4 from sensors 22 . as a result , when radiation is incident on the array , as illustrated by the arrows coming up from the bottom of the figure , the portion of the radiation that is not absorbed in sensors 22 passes through cavities 24 , reflects back from reflectors 26 , and nulls the incident radiation at the sensor surface . reflectors 26 are held in place by “ columns ” 28 , comprising metal and possibly dielectric layers , which are deposited on the sensor wafer as a part of the fabrication process . cavities 24 in this example are shown as open spaces , but the cavities may alternatively contain dielectric material , as illustrated in fig3 and 4 . fig2 a and 2b schematically show details of the structure of sensing elements 21 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . fig2 a is a sectional view , while fig2 b is a top view of reflector 26 . in this example , sensor 22 is formed from a silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) wafer , with the silicon base wafer etched off the back side to reveal a buried oxide ( box ) layer 30 . the sensor itself comprises a silicon wafer layer 32 , with a polysilicon layer 34 deposited over the wafer and doped to define a source 36 , a drain 38 , and a gate 40 of the tmos transistor . typically , the area of each sensing element is on the order of 45 × 45 μm ( and these are the dimensions of the reflector shown in fig2 b ), but larger or smaller sensing elements may similarly be produced in this manner . reflector 26 is supported at a distance of λ / 4 from the tmos transistor by columns 28 , which comprise a stack of metal layers 42 and interconnecting vias 44 . in this case , λ / 4 is roughly 2 . 5 μm , since cavity 24 is under vacuum or filled with air . the layers and vias in columns 28 are formed by the deposition steps that are applied in depositing and etching successive metal and dielectric layers over wafer layer 32 . these same metal layers 42 ( comprising copper , for example ) are typically also used for making connections to source 36 , drain 38 , and gate 40 of the transistors and other elements of the sensor array device . reflector 26 is likewise formed from one of these metal layers , for example , the fourth metal layer ( m4 ), which is dedicated and shaped for use as the individual cavity reflectors , rather than for electrical connections . additional metal layers 46 , 48 may overlie reflector 28 . in the pictured example , reflector 26 is perforated by a matrix of through - holes . these through - holes , whose width is substantially less than λ / 4 , are etching holes , which are used in removing the dielectric material from cavity 24 in order to give the desired , overall optical path length of λ / 4 between the transistor and reflector 26 . fig3 is a schematic sectional view of a sensing element 50 in a tmos sensor array , in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention . in this embodiment , cavity 24 contains dielectric material , so that the radiation wavelength in the cavity is effectively shorter ( by 1 / n , wherein n is the effective refractive index at the radiation wavelength ). therefore , the cavity is simpler to fabricate and more stable than an open cavity , and it may be made physically shorter than the open cavity of the preceding embodiments . sensing element 50 comprises a box layer 52 , overlaid by a silicon wafer 56 with a polysilicon layer 58 containing the source and drain of the sensor transistor , separated from the box layer by shallow - trench isolation ( sti ) 54 . a silicon nitride layer 60 is deposited over the transistor components , followed by a pre - metal dielectric ( pmd ) layer 62 . a first metal layer 64 ( m1 ) is deposited over pmd layer 62 , with vias ( not shown in the figure ) connecting it to the source , drain and gate of the transistor in layer 58 . layer 64 may be formed using a damascene process , for example , by depositing a silicon nitride layer 66 followed by an inter - layer dielectric ( ild ) 68 , and then etching trenches and filling them with copper . these layers are overlaid with another silicon nitride layer 70 and ild 72 , followed by a further metal layer 74 ( m2 ), which serves as the cavity reflector . additional nitride layers 76 , ild 78 and metal layers 80 may be formed over or alongside cavity 24 . cavity 24 in sensing element 50 extends between polysilicon layer 58 and metal layer 74 . the effective dielectric constant ε eff of the cavity , at the relevant wavelength ( 9 μm in this example ), can be computed using the individual thicknesses and respective dielectric indices of the layers in the cavity , as illustrated in the following table : layer thickness ( nm ) ε weight nitride 50 7 350 pmd 360 4 . 2 1512 nitride 40 8 . 1 324 ild 220 3 . 7 814 nitride 40 8 . 1 324 ild 360 3 . 7 1332 sum 1070 4650 based on this table , the effective dielectric constant ε eff of the entire cavity is 4650 / 1070 = 4 . 351 . the effective refractive index n eff of cavity 24 is equal to the square root of ε eff , i . e ., n eff = 2 . 09 . therefore , the effective thickness of the cavity is 2 . 09 × 1 . 070 μm ≅ 2 . 25 μm , i . e ., λ / 4 at 9 μm . the layer thicknesses may be adjusted in similar fashion to give substantially any desired effective cavity thickness for any target wavelength . since metal layer 74 serves as a reflector , it is generally not available for connection of the circuit elements in the sensor array . layer 80 ( m3 ) and higher metal layers may be used for this purpose . the addition of dielectric and metal layers over each sensor in the manner shown in fig3 increases the thermal mass , and hence the response time , of the sensing elements , but the sensor array may be designed to minimize this effect , as shown in the next figure . fig4 is a schematic sectional view of an array 90 of sensing elements 50 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . box layer 52 , on which sensing elements 50 are formed , is supported by a part of a silicon substrate 92 that remains after etching away the original soi support wafer . source 36 and drain 38 , which are formed in a polysilicon layer 94 , are connected by vias to respective conductors in metal layer 64 , as is gate 40 . sensing elements 50 comprise dielectric cavities 96 with an effective thickness of λ / 4 between the transistor and the individual reflector that is formed by metal layer 74 in each sensing element . additional metal layers are contained in columns 98 , which serve to maintain the optical and thermal separation between adjacent sensing elements . optionally , the sensor arrays described above may include a “ blind sensor ,” which senses only its own temperature and not the scene background , and can thus be used as an indicator of sensor array temperature for purposes of background subtraction . there are several approaches to making a sensor “ blind ”: 1 . a sensor that “ sees ” a mirror ( not a cavity ) is blind since it sees only “ itself ”. 2 . a sensor with the “ wrong ” cavity will be blind since it will not absorb radiation of the target wavelength . 3 . a sensor covered with a mirrors ( in the direction of the incoming flux ), which completely reflect the incoming radiation , will similarly be blind . fig5 is a schematic sectional illustration of a blind sensing element 100 , in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention . sensing element 100 is an example of the second approach listed above for creating a blind sensor . in element 100 , first metal layer 64 ( m1 ) is extended across the cavity behind the sensing element , at a distance equal to λ 1 / 4n eff , such that λ 1 & lt ; λ 2 , wherein λ 2 is the wavelength of interest , such as 9 - 10 μm as in the preceding examples . the effective optical path from the transistor to m 1 is thus considerably less than λ 2 / 4n eff , and sensing element 100 will therefore be blind to radiation of wavelength λ 2 . at the same time , a bandpass filter 102 , which is typically provided in order to prevent radiation outside the range of interest , such as outside the range of 9 - 10 μm , from reaching the sensing elements , blocks radiation at wavelength λ 1 . consequently , blind sensing element 100 will absorb very little radiation from the scene . this blind sensing element and the enhanced capabilities it supports can be provided at little or no added cost in terms of device fabrication and packaging . fig6 is a schematic sectional illustration of a multi - band sensing element 110 , in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention . in this case , metal layer 64 is patterned to create an additional cavity reflector 112 , at a distance λ 1 / 4n eff from the transistor in sensing element 110 . metal layer 74 remains positioned at a distance λ 2 / 4n eff from the transistor , as in the preceding examples . consequently , the cavity behind sensing element 110 has resonances at both λ 1 and λ 2 , and the sensing element will thus be sensitive to both of these wavelengths ( assuming neither wavelength range is filtered out of the incoming radiation ). sensing element 110 may be designed in this manner , for example , to sense radiation in both the 3 - 5 μm and 8 - 10 μm bands . optionally , the geometry of the sensing element may be modified to have three or more resonant wavelengths . as a further option , different sensing elements in the same array may have respective reflectors at different distances , so that different sensing elements are sensitive to different wavelengths . it will be appreciated that the embodiments described above are cited by way of example , and that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove . rather , the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove , as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description and which are not disclosed in the prior art .",6
"as shown in fig1 a ballast 10 , which includes a drive control circuit 65 , is connected to a lamp 85 . lamp 85 can be , but is not limited to a fluorescent lamp of the cold cathode type , which is partially surrounded by a shield 925 . the light from lamp 85 can be used to illuminate a liquid crystal display ( lcd ) of a computer ( not shown ). shield 925 reflects light from lamp 85 toward the lcd . a portion of the electromagnetic interference ( emi ) generated by lamp 85 is also blocked by shield 925 so as to minimize interfering with surrounding electrical devices . the parasitic capacitance between lamp 85 and shield 925 is represented by a parasitic capacitor 80 . lamp 85 is connected to a secondary winding 915 of a transformer 910 . the leakage inductance of transformer 910 is represented by leakage inductor 83 . the parasitic capacitances associated with transformer 910 are represented by a capacitor 81 . parasitic capacitances associated with transformer 910 can exist between a primary winding 920 of transformer 910 and secondary 915 , within secondary winding 915 and primary winding 920 , between a ferrite core 911 of transformer 910 and secondary winding 915 / primary winding 920 and between transformer 910 and ground . a resonant circuit is formed by a resonant inductor 75 , leakage inductor 83 and parasitic capacitors 80 and 81 . other than resonant inductor 75 , there is no other discrete inductor or capacitor included which substantially affects the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit . there is also no discrete ballasting element , typically a capacitor , in series with lamp 85 . the elimination of these discrete components from the resonant circuit or serially connected to lamp 85 reduces the parts count and cost of ballast 10 . power losses associated with these discrete components are also eliminated thereby improving the ballast efficiency . a capacitor 126 is serially connected to resonant inductor 75 . a pair of switches 100 and 112 are serially connected between a bus 40 and a bus 50 . bus 40 is at the high rail voltage . bus 50 is at the low rail ( common ) voltage . switches 100 and 112 are metal oxide semiconductor , field effect transistors ( mosfets ) which are joined together at a junction 110 . a capacitor 115 is connected from a junction 110 to rail 50 . capacitor 126 is a blocking capacitor which filters out the dc portion of a trapezoidal voltage ( vds ) produced at junction 110 . trapezoidal voltage vds is illustrated in fig2 c . capacitor 115 slows down the voltage transition ( dv / dt ) across the drain - source voltage of each switch 100 and 112 and thereby facilitates turn on and turn off of each switch when the voltage thereacross is substantially zero ( i . e . zero voltage switching ). the half - bridge switching circuit ( i . e . switching stage ) includes switches 100 and 112 . these switches are turned on and off by a drive control circuit ic 109 . a gating signal vg1 is supplied by ic 109 along a gate line 1002 to control the conductive state of switch 100 . a gating signal vg2 is supplied by ic 109 along a gate line 1004 to control the conductive state of switch 112 . switches 100 and 112 are never turned on at the same time and have on time duty ratios of slightly less than 50 % as shown in fig2 a and 2b , respectively . a small dead time tdead during which both switches are turned off is required to permit the zero voltage switching to be implemented . a switch 815 prevents switch 100 from being turned on when switch 112 is turned on . gating signals at high logic levels supplied at the same time to each of these switches for turning on each switch can occur during a fault ( transient ). the gates of switches 112 and 815 are connected to each other . when switch 112 is turned on by gating signal vg2 being at a high logic level , switch 815 is also turned on by gating signal vg2 . when switch 815 is turned on , the gating signal vg1 is shunted to bus 50 thereby turning off switch 100 . accordingly , switch 100 can not remain in a conductive state when switch 112 is turned on . a capacitor 800 is an input bypass capacitor for filtering the high frequency harmonics generated by switches 100 and 112 . a dc voltage source , such as a battery ( not shown ), when connected to a pair of terminals 61 and 62 which terminate buses 40 and 50 , respectively , provides a dc voltage between buses 40 and 50 . a pair of transistors ( e . g . bipolar transistors ) 805 and 810 , a pair of resistors 820 and 830 and a zener diode 825 together form a linear regulator . this linear regulator is connected to a pin vdd of ic 109 to power the latter . a ttl logic - level signal from an external source such as , but not limited to , a computer ( not shown ) is applied along a line 1010 to the base of transistor 810 through a terminal 63 . when terminal 63 is at a high logic level , transistor 810 turns on which activates the linear regulator . the regulated voltage supplied to pin vdd of ic 109 by the linear regulator is equal to the sum of the voltages across zener diode 825 and resistor 830 . the voltage across resistor 830 is equal to the voltage at terminal 63 less the voltage across the base - emitter of switch 810 . when terminal 63 is at a low logic level , transistor 810 turns off . the linear regulator is deactivated . no voltage is supplied to pin vdd of ic 109 . ic 109 and ballast 10 are shut down . in other words , when terminal 63 is at a high logic level , ballast 10 is turned on . when terminal 63 is at a low logic level , ballast 10 is turned off . the linear regulator , which is connected to bus 40 through a line 1001 , permits a relatively large range of dc power supplies to be connected between terminals 61 and 62 for operating ballast 10 . generally , dc power supplies ranging from about 8 volts to about 30 volts can be used for operating ballast 10 . the linear regulator also minimizes the power required to operate ic 109 . the power dissipated by ic 109 and its associated circuitry is minimized by the linear regulator maintaining a relatively constant level of voltage supplied to pin vdd of ic 109 . the voltage outputted by the linear regulator is substantially the same regardless of whether the voltage across terminals 61 and 62 is about 8 volts or about 30 volts . ic 109 tracks the resonant frequency by sensing the current flowing through resonant inductor 75 and operates the half - bridge inverter at a switching frequency above the resonant frequency . a resistor 900 and a capacitor 905 form an integration circuit for sensing the current flowing through resonant inductor 75 . the voltage across capacitor 905 , which is approximately proportional to the integral of the voltage of a winding 950 coupled to inductor 75 , represents the current through inductor 75 . ic 109 senses the zero - crossing of current flowing through inductor 75 based on the voltage at an rind pin of ic 109 . based on the zero - crossing timing and the feedback system , ic 109 determines the forward conduction time for switches 100 and 112 . ic 109 drives the half - bridge inverter into an inductive mode so that there is a phase delay between the half - bridge node voltage vds and the inductor current il as shown in fig2 c and 2d . capacitive mode operation of the inverter is prevented by a capacitive mode protection circuit within ic 109 . ic 109 regulates lamp power by sensing lamp current and lamp voltage . lamp current is sensed by a sensing resistor 153 . the lamp current signal is fed to a pair of pins li1 and li2 of ic 109 through a pair of resistors 171 and 168 along a pair of lines 1007 and 1006 , respectively . the lamp current signal is amplified and rectified by ic 109 . lamp voltage is sensed from primary winding 920 by the combination of a line 1008 , a diode 180 , a pair of resistors 930 and 189 and a capacitor 183 . the rc network of resistors 930 and 189 and capacitor 183 forms a low - pass filter which provides an average value of lamp voltage to be applied to a pin vl of ic 109 . ic 109 calculates the lamp power by multiplying the lamp current signal and lamp voltage signal . the calculated lamp power is represented by a current which is supplied to a crect pin of ic 109 . the current supplied to the crect pin by ic 109 flows into an rc network formed by a pair of resistors 935 and 195 and a pair of capacitors 192 and 940 . this rc network has two poles and one zero to stabilize a feedback system . a dc voltage is provided at the crect pin through a low - pass filter formed by a resistor 195 and a capacitor 192 . the dc voltage at the crect pin is compared with the voltage at a dim pin of ic 109 by an error amplifier within ic 109 . the output of the error amplifier controls the forward conduction time of switches 100 and 112 . a feedback system maintains the voltage at the crect pin equal to the voltage at the dim pin thereby regulating lamp power . adjusting the voltage level at the dim pin changes the level to which the lamp power will be set to . the maximum lamp power as characterized by lamp brightness can be set to one of two levels by the ttl level ( 0 or 5 volts ) applied to a terminal bright of ballast 10 from an external source ( not shown ). the bright terminal is connected to a resistor 835 by a line 1011 . another terminal vdd of ballast 10 is connected to resistor 840 by a line 1012 . terminal vdd 10 is connected to an external dc voltage source ( e . g . 5 v ) ( not shown ). when a low logic level ( e . g . 0 volts ) is applied to terminal bright , the voltage applied to the dim pin , which sets the lamp power to one of two maximum levels , is determined by the voltage divider formed by a pair of resistors 835 and 840 . when a high logic level ( e . g . 5 volts ) is applied to terminal bright , the voltage applied to the dim pin increases and is clamped by ic 109 at about 3 . 0v , resulting in a higher maximum lamp power level . actual dimming of the lamp is based , in part , on a control circuit 198 which includes a pulse width modulation ( pwm ) scheme . the voltage at the crect pin is equal to the product of the current flowing out from the crect pin and the resistance connected from the crect pin to bus 50 ( i . e . common ). the voltage at the crect pin is maintained at the same voltage as the dim pin by the feedback system . when an additional resistor is connected between the crect pin and bus 50 , the total resistance between the crect pin and bus 50 is reduced . a higher current flows from the crect pin in order to maintain the voltage at the crect pin at the same voltage as the dim pin . this higher current level represents that more power is delivered to the lamp increasing its brightness . when the resistance between the crect pin and bus 50 is increased , a lower current flows from the crect pin in maintaining the crect pin voltage equal to the dim pin voltage . this lower current level represents that less power is delivered to the lamp decreasing its brightness . the amount of resistance between the crect pin and bus 50 is controlled by control circuit 198 . control circuit 198 includes a dual voltage - comparator ic 850 having an open - collector output at its pin outb . ic 850 is available , for example , from national semiconductor corporation of santa clara , calif . as part no . lm393m . the supply voltage for ic 850 is provided from terminal 63 of ballast 10 . one of the two voltage comparators within ic 850 in combination with a plurality of resistors 855 , 860 , 865 , 870 and 875 and a capacitor 880 form a triangular waveform oscillator at a frequency of 100 hz - 1 khz . a second voltage comparator within ic 850 compares the voltage from a dimin terminal of ballast 10 with the triangular waveform across capacitor 880 . the outb pin is at the bus 50 ( common ) potential when the voltage of the triangular waveform is greater than the voltage at an inb + pin of ic 850 . the outb pin is otherwise open ( floating ) when the voltage of the triangular waveform is less than the voltage at the inb + pin of ic 850 . in other words , a duty ratio dpwm of the outb pin is determined by the voltage at terminal dimin . the dimin terminal is connected to an external dc voltage source ( not shown ) which varies in potential between about 0 to 5 volts . resistor rdim is therefore connected and disconnected between the crect pin and bus 50 at the dpwm duty ratio of the outb pin . lamp power will therefore jump between a higher and lower level at the dpwm duty ratio . the average lamp power is proportional to the dpwm duty ratio . the level to which lamp 85 is dimmed is determined by the voltage applied to terminal dimin . the dimin terminal is connected to resistor 895 by a line 1009 . resistors 895 and 885 form a voltage divider , the voltage at the junction therebetween being biased by the voltage at terminal 63 through resistor 890 . the higher the voltage at the dimin terminal , the smaller the duty ratio dpwm thereby lowering the average lamp power and light level . in the event of lamp short - circuit , a large current may flow through resonant inductor 75 . a higher voltage across capacitor 905 results . this higher voltage is sensed by the combination of a diode 182 , a pair of resistors 930 and 189 and capacitor 183 . the rc network of resistors 930 and 189 and capacitor 183 forms a low - pass filter which provides an average value of voltage at capacitor 905 to be applied to a pin vl of ic 109 . the average value of voltage represents the current flowing through inductor 75 . the product of inductor 75 current and lamp 85 current can thereby be regulated . saturation of inductor 75 is therefore prevented . ic 109 , ic 850 and transistors 805 , 810 and 815 can be integrated into a single ic chip if desired . integrated circuit ( ic ) 109 includes a plurality of pins . a pin rind is connected by a line 1005 to junction 179 of resistor 900 and capacitor 905 . resistor 900 and capacitor 905 form an integration circuit to sense current through inductor 75 . the voltage across capacitor 905 , which is approximately proportional to the integral of the voltage at the secondary winding 950 of inductor 75 , represents the current through inductor 75 . therefore the input voltage at pin rind reflects ( a representative sample ) the level of current flowing through inductor 75 . a pin vdd , which is connected to junction 807 of the linear regulator , supplies the voltage for driving ic 109 . a pin li2 is connected through a resistor 168 to bus 50 ( common ). a pin li1 is connected through a resistor 171 to junction 88 . the difference between the currents inputted to pins li1 and li2 reflects the sensed current flowing through lamp 85 . the voltage at a pin vl , which is connected through a resistor 189 to junction 181 , reflects somewhat the averaging voltage of lamp 85 . the current flowing out of a crect pin into ground through a parallel combination of a resistor 195 , a capacitor 192 , and a series circuit of a resistor 935 and a capacitor 940 , reflects the average power of lamp 85 ( i . e . the product of lamp current and lamp voltage ). a control circuit 198 changes the total resistance from crect pin to ground for dimming control . capacitor 192 serves to provide a filtered d . c . voltage across resistor 195 . a resistor 156 is connected between a pin rref and ground and serves to set the reference current within ic 109 . a capacitor 159 , which is connected between a cf pin and ground , sets the frequency of a current controlled oscillator ( cco ). a capacitor 165 , which is connected between a cp pin and ground , is employed for timing of the nonoscillating / standby mode . a gnd pin is connected directly to bus 50 ( common ). a pair of pins g1 and g2 are connected directly to gates g1 and g2 of switches 100 and 112 , respectively . a pin s1 , which is connected directly to junction 110 , represents the voltage at the source of switch 100 . a pin fvdd is connected to junction 110 through a capacitor 138 and represents the floating supply for ic 109 . a capacitor 213 is connected between the dim pin and ground . the voltage applied to the dim pin reflects the maximum level of illumination as set by dim control circuit 198 . operation of the inverter and drive control circuit 65 is as follows . initially ( i . e . during startup ), as capacitor 106 is charged from the linear regulator output 807 , switches 100 and 112 are in nonconducting and conducting states , respectively . the input current flowing into pin vdd of ic 109 is maintained at a low level ( less than 500 microamperes ) during this startup phase . capacitor 138 , which is connected between pin 51 and pin fvdd , charges to a relatively constant voltage equal to approximately the voltage at pin vdd and serves as the voltage supply for the drive circuit of switch 100 . when the voltage across cap 106 exceeds a voltage turnon threshold ( e . g . 8 volts ), ic 109 enters its operating ( oscillating / switching ) state with switches 100 and 112 each switching back and forth between their conducting and nonconducting states at a frequency well above the resonant frequency determined by inductor 75 , leakage inductor 83 and all parasitic capacitors 80 and 81 . junction 110 varies between about 0 volts and the voltage applied to terminal 61 depending on the switching states of switches 100 and 112 . capacitor 115 serves to slow down the rate of rise and fall of the voltage at junction 110 thereby reducing switching losses and the level of emi generated by the switching stage of the inverter . a relatively large operating current of , for example , 10 - 15 milliamps supplied to pin vdd of ic 109 results . capacitor 126 serves to block the d . c . voltage component from being applied to transformer 910 . the initial operating frequency of ic 109 , which is about 150 khz , is set by resistor 156 and capacitor 159 and the reverse diode conducting times of switches 100 and 112 . ic 109 starts sweeping down its switching frequency at a rate set internal to ic 109 toward an unloaded resonant frequency ( i . e . resonant frequency of inductor 75 and capacitor 80 prior to ignition of lamp 85 -- e . g . 60 khz ). as the switching frequency approaches the resonant frequency , the voltage across lamp 85 rises rapidly and is generally sufficient to ignite lamp 85 . once lamp 85 is lit , the current flowing therethrough rises from a few nano - amps to several milliamps . the current flowing through resistor 153 , which is equal to the lamp current , is sensed at pins li1 and li2 based on the current differential therebetween as proportioned by resistors 168 and 171 , respectively . the voltage of lamp 85 , which is scaled by the turns ratio of the transformer 910 , is detected by diode 180 , resistors 930 , and capacitor 183 resulting in a d . c . voltage , proportional to the averaging lamp voltage , at junction 181 . the voltage at junction 181 is converted into a current by resistor 189 flowing into pin vl . the current flowing into pin vl is multiplied inside ic 109 with the differential currents between pins li1 and li2 resulting in a rectified a . c . current fed out of pin crect into the parallel combination of capacitor 192 , resistor 195 , and , the series circuit of resistor 935 and capacitor 940 . capacitor 192 and resistor 195 convert the a . c . rectified current into a d . c . voltage . the voltage at the crect pin is forced equal to the voltage at the dim pin by a feedback circuit / loop contained within ic 109 . regulation of power consumed by lamp 85 results . a more detailed description regarding the circuitry and operation of ic 109 can be found in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 680 , 017 , issued oct . 21 , 1997 , and which is incorporated herein by reference thereto . fig3 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention . those components in fig1 and 3 of similar construction and operation are identified by like reference numerals and will not be further discussed herein . as shown in fig3 a ballast 10 &# 39 ; includes a capacitor 126 &# 39 ; serves as both a blocking capacitor and ballasting element . the amount of power saved by eliminating the ballasting element in fig1 is not achieved by the ballast of fig3 . nevertheless , by placing capacitor 126 &# 39 ; on the primary side of transformer 910 rather than on its secondary side less power is consumed than in a conventional ballast . the size and power loss of step - up transformer 910 is reduced . unlike ballast 10 of fig1 a discrete resonant capacitor 80 &# 39 ; is required as part of the resonant circuit . ballasting capacitor 126 &# 39 ; and resonant capacitor 80 &# 39 ; together provide dc voltage blocking . unlike conventional ballasts , however , no additional dc blocking capacitor on the secondary of transformer 910 is required . the power loss associated with the equivalent series resistance ( esr ) of an additional blocking capacitor is eliminated . a low - voltage , low - esr capacitor can be used for ballasting capacitor 126 &# 39 ;. ballast 10 &# 39 ;, as compared to conventional ballasts , has a reduced parts count and cost and consumes less power . in ballast 10 , the sensing circuit for monitoring the current flowing through inductor 75 is formed by winding 950 , resistor 900 and capacitor 905 . the voltage at junction 179 of ballast 10 represents the current through resonant inductor 75 . in ballast 10 &# 39 ;, the sensing circuit for monitoring the current flowing through inductor 75 is formed by a single resistor 162 . similar to ballast 10 , the voltage at junction 179 &# 39 ; represents the current through the resonant inductor 75 . it will thus be seen that the objects set forth above and those made apparent from the preceding description , are efficiently attained and since certain changes can be made in the above construction without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention , it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense .",7
"fig1 depicts a preferred embodiment high pressure , manually - operable air pump of the present invention , indicated generally at 10 , in a preferred mounting on a bicycle , a portion of which is depicted and indicated generally at 12 . the air pump 10 of the present invention is used as the seat post coupling the seat 14 , to the bike frame , indicated generally at 16 . a lower end of the pump 10 is received in the seat tube 26 of the frame 12 and is clamped in the frame 12 with the collar 28 provided at the mouth of the seat tube 26 . the upper end of the pump 10 is received and clamped in the seat post collar 30 ( sectioned in fig1 ) of the seat 14 . referring to fig2 where the preferred air pump 10 is shown separated from the bicycle 12 , the pump 10 includes a first elongated tube 18 and a second elongated tube 20 , shorter than and coaxial with the first tube 18 . the first tube 18 has an outer diameter sufficient to permit that tube to be removably received in the seat tube 26 of the frame 16 and clamped to the frame by a collar 28 ( see fig1 ) of the seat tube 26 . preferably , the outer diameter of the first tube is between about seven -

half inches or less . means , indicated generally at 32 , are provided for fixedly securing together , and , preferably , for releasably , immovably securing together the first and second elongated tubes 18 and 20 . fixedly securing in this instance means without relative translational or rotational movement of the elongated tube tubes 18 and 20 with respect to one another . preferably , means 32 comprises a first mating member , preferably in the form of a first elongated planar flange 34 , which protrudes radially outwardly from an end ( the upper end in the figures ) of the first tube 18 . means 32 preferably further comprises a second mating member , preferably in the form of a second , identically elongated planar flange 36 protruding radially outwardly at an end ( lower end in the figures ) of the second tube 20 proximal the first tube 18 . the planar flanges are parallel to one another to permit their joining together . preferably , each of the first and second flanges 34 and 36 is fixedly secured to the first and second tubes 18 and 20 , respectively , by suitable , conventional means such as brazing or , preferably , welding 68 ( see fig3 ). a first , removable fastener 40 , a flexible support 41 ( flexibly coupling the first fastener 40 with the first elongated tube 18 ), a second fixed fastener 42 and a flexible hose 44 having at its exposed end 48 an air valve coupling 50 are further depicted in fig2 . as is shown in fig1 the pump 10 is preferably positioned with the first fastener 40 towards a front side of the seat 14 to fit into the space provided above the cross tube 27 of the frame 16 and the front side of the seat tube collar 28 . the internal construction of the pump 10 is revealed in fig3 and 4 . the first elongated tube 18 constitutes a housing of the pump and defines a cylindrical pump chamber 52 therein having a closed end 54 . a piston assembly , indicated generally at 56 , is provided and includes a piston 58 within the chamber 52 , a connecting arm 60 having a first end 62 coupled with the piston 58 and an opposing second end 64 , and an air passage , indicated generally at 66 , extending generally axially through the piston 58 . the passage preferably continues through the connecting arm 60 . the second end 64 of the connecting arm 60 is fixedly coupled with the second flange member 36 by suitable means such as mutually engaging threading . the second flange member 36 in turn fixedly supports the second elongated tube 20 which is secured to the second flange member 36 by suitable means such as the welds 68 . each of the second flange member 36 and the attached second elongated tube 20 provides a means for gripping the connecting arm 60 and manually reciprocating the piston 58 in the chamber 52 . fig3 and 4 further depict a first , one - way valve means , indicated generally at 70 , on the piston 58 and a second , one - way valve means , indicated generally at 88 , along the air passage 66 . referring to fig3 the first valve means 70 preferably comprises an annular valve member 72 , preferably an elastic 0 - ring , and a first groove 74 . the first groove 74 extends circumferentially around an outer surface of the piston 58 and receives the annular valve member 72 . preferably , the first groove 74 has an axial dimension which is greater than the maximum axial dimension of the annular valve member 72 , to permit axial movement of the valve member 72 along the groove 74 . as also can be seen in fig3 and 4 , the piston 58 preferably is fabricated from first and second annular components 76 and 78 , respectively , which are attached by suitable means , such as threading , to the first end 62 of the connecting arm 64 . the first annular component 76 has one end of reduced diameter and forms the bottom and one side of the first groove 74 . the second annular component 78 preferably includes a beveled , generally frustoconical , circumferential surface 82 ( best seen in fig4 ) adjoining and facing the reduced diameter end of the first component 76 . the beveled surface 82 forms a seat for the annular valve member 72 . surface 82 is located at an end of the groove 74 which is distal to the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 . opposing grooves 84 are provided axially along the circumferential surface of the first annular component 76 . these grooves 84 define a portion of the circumferential groove 74 which is configured to permit air to pass between the annular valve member 72 and the piston 58 when the valve member 72 is located as shown in fig4 over that portion of the circumferential groove 74 containing the axial extending grooves 84 . preferably , a first end 46 of the flexible hose 44 is passed through the length of the connecting arm 60 and fixedly coupled to the first end 62 of the connecting arm 60 by means of an annular insert 86 which is received in the extreme end of the hose 44 clamping that end between the insert 86 and the inner circumferential surface of the connecting arm 60 . preferably , the outer cylindrical surface of the insert 86 which is received in the extreme end of the hose 44 is finished , for example by the provisions of threading or serrations , to better grip the first end 46 of the hose 44 . in this way , the first end 46 of the hose 44 is fixedly coupled with the piston assembly 56 and the second tube 20 and pneumatically coupled with the air passage 66 in the piston 58 . referring to fig4 the insert 86 forms one seat of the second , one - way valve means 88 located along the air passage 66 . the remainder of the second valve means 88 is preferably provided by an interior chamber 90 , which is formed in the first annular component 76 , an elastic o - ring 92 , which forms an opposing seat of the valve means 88 , and a valve member in the form of a sphere 94 . fig3 further depicts details of the preferred means 32 for fixedly securing the first and second elongated tubes together . the preferred means 32 includes , in addition to the first and second flanges 34 and 36 and the first and second fasteners 40 and 42 , an unthreaded bore 96 through the first flange member 34 and a threaded bore 98 through the second flange member 36 . the threaded bore 98 is alignable with the unthreaded bore 96 for receiving a threaded portion 40a of the fastener 40 extending through the unthreaded bore 96 , for fixedly securing together the mated first and second flange members 34 and 36 in a removable fashion . the second fastener 42 preferably is a rivet extending fixedly through the first flange 34 on a side of the tubes 18 and 20 diametrically opposed to the first fastener 40 and bores 96 and 98 . a portion of the rivet 42 , protruding axially from the first flange 34 towards the second flange 36 , is received in a cut - out 36a , which is exposed on a side of the second flange 36 , when the flanges 36 and 38 rotate to align the bores 96 and 98 . head portion 42a at the rivet 42 and the first flange 36 prevent relative axial movement of the second flange 38 , thereby securing the tubes 18 and 20 together . the first and second fasteners 40 and 42 on opposing sides of the tubes 18 and 20 prevent bending of the pump at the flanges 36 and 38 . lastly , an open end of the first elongated tube 18 , opposite closed end 54 , can be at least partially closed , for example by a third annular component 100 , which includes a central bore 102 to permit extension of the second end 64 of the connecting arm 60 from the first elongated tube 18 , and one or more additional bores , such as bore 104 which permits the free passage of air into and out of the first elongated tube 18 . the component 100 prevents debris from entering the first tube 18 . it may provide some support and guidance to the connecting arm 60 but the preferred construction of the piston assembly 56 is such that the assembly 56 maintains itself coaxial in the tube 18 . fig5 depicts diagrammatically a preferred configuration for the air valve connector 50 , also seen in fig2 . the connector 50 is mounted at a second end 48 of the flexible hose 44 and includes a central tubular member 106 one end of which has a conically tapered outer surface 108 which is inserted into the end 48 of hose 44 . a fastening member 112 is clamped over the end 48 and one end of central member 106 fastening the connector 50 to the hose 44 . a threaded collar 114 is rotatably supported at the remaining end of the central tubular member 106 . the threaded collar 114 is sized to be received by a conventional air valve stem for coupling the flexible hose 44 to the stem . an annular sealing gasket 118 , such as an o - ring , is preferably provided . it is specifically noted that unlike most conventional air valve connectors , the preferred connector 50 of the present invention lacks a central stalk or other solid structure for depressing the air valve in the valve stem ( neither depicted ). as will be subsequently explained in further detail , this is because the pump 10 of the present invention is capable of compressing air to a sufficiently high pressure to force depression of an air valve in a stem without physically contacting that valve . use and operation of the pump 10 will now be described with respect to the various figures . as shown in fig1 the pump 10 can be constructed of suitable material with suitable dimensions , for example , about 1018 to 1027 mild steel seamless tubing , preferably mandrel drawn , with about a 50 mil wall thickness , as the elongated tubes 18 and 20 , so as to permit use of the pump 10 as the seat post for supporting a conventionally constructed bicycle seat 14 on a conventionally constructed bike frame 16 . the pump 10 may be originally installed or subsequently installed as a replacement for a conventional seat post . the pump 10 may be used by removing the flexible hose 44 from the storage bag 15 ( fig1 ), if provided , and the air valve connector 50 attached to a conventional threaded air valve stem like that which is provided with tires , tubes or the like . the fastener 40 is unscrewed from the second flange 36 and the tubes 18 lo and 20 rotated to free rivet 42 from flange 36 to separate first and second tubes 18 and 20 . the second tube 20 , still fixedly secured to the seat 14 , may be raised and lowered by raising and lowering the seat 14 while the pump is still mounted on the bicycle 12 to reciprocate the piston 58 along the chamber 52 . after use , rivet 42 and cutout 36a may be engaged and the threaded portion 40a of fastener 40 may again be passed through unthreaded opening 96 into the threaded bore 98 for securing the first and second tubes 18 and 20 together . the air valve connector 50 may be removed from the valve stem and the flexible hose 44 returned to the storage bag 15 , if provided . of course , the pump 10 may be used as a conventional hand - operated air pump when not mounted in a bicycle . it may be installed as a seat post in and subsequently removed from any number of conventional bicycles , without alterations to either the bicycles or their seats , making the pump 10 extremely versatile . fig3 and 4 depict in detail the operation of the first and second valve means 70 and 88 , which provide the pump 10 of the present invention with certain unique capabilities . fig3 depicts the positions of the first and second valve means 70 and 88 during a compression stroke when the piston assembly 56 is being moved in a first axial direction ( down in the figure ) into the first tube 18 and towards the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 . fig4 depicts the configuration of the two valve means 70 and 88 during a reciprocal , refill stroke when the piston 58 is being moved in a second , opposing axial direction away from the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 . referring first to fig3 during the compression stroke , air is compressed by the piston 58 in the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 by the first valve means 70 . in particular , the o - ring valve member 72 tends to drag slightly on the inner wall of chamber 52 during movement of the piston 58 towards the closed end 54 , seating on the beveled valve seat ( 82 in fig4 ). the o - ring 72 , being elastically deformable , expands further into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the chamber 52 when that valve member 72 is seated against the valve seat 82 by the compressed air trapped in the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 to further seal the annular gap 120 which exists between the inner circumferential surface of the chamber 52 and the outer circumferential surface of the piston 58 . in this regard , the beveled valve seat 82 used in connection with the elastic o - ring 72 is a very important feature of the invention . as the pressure of the air being compressed by the piston 58 builds up in the closed end 54 , the o - ring 72 is pressed increasingly harder onto the tapered valve seat 82 and into the narrowing gap formed between the beveled surface of the seat 82 and the inner circumferential surface of the chamber 52 , thereby expanding the o - ring 72 into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the chamber 52 and increasing the sealing effect . this particular configuration permits the preferred pump 10 to compress air to pressures of up to at least about two hundred psi . the major limitation to maximum air compression of the pump 10 is not the operation of the pump but rather the ability of the user to apply sufficient force to the piston assembly 56 to further compress the air . preferably , a single , first tube 18 defines both a housing and the cylindrical pump chamber contained therein . however , since the optimum outer diameter of the first tube 18 must be sufficiently large to permit that tube 18 to be clamped within a seat tube collar 28 of conventional construction , the diameter of the cylindrical chamber may be reduced , thereby reducing the cross - sectional area of the chamber 52 and total force which must be applied to the piston assembly 56 to achieve a given compression , for example by the use of the second elongated tube ( not depicted ) within the first elongated tube 18 to reduce the diameter of the cylindrical pump chamber 52 . during the compression stroke , the valve member sphere ( 94 in fig4 ) of the second valve means 88 is eventually forced from the surface of the o - ring ( 92 in fig4 ) when the pressure of the air being compressed at the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 exceeds the pressure of the air in the air passage 66 , thereby permitting compressed air to pass from the chamber 52 into the air passage 66 . referring to fig4 during the reciprocal or refill stroke , the piston 58 is moved in a second , opposing axial direction ( up in the figure ) away from the closed end 54 . friction between the o - ring valve member 72 and the inner circumferential surface of the chamber 52 causes the member 72 to move away from the beveled seat 82 and over the axially extending grooves 84 , thereby permitting air , which enters the first tube 18 through the additional bore 104 of the third annular component 100 , to pass between the piston 58 and the o - ring 72 and enter the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 . at the same time , the compressed air in the air passage 66 and / or any partial vacuum created at the closed end 54 of the chamber 52 cause the sphere 94 of the second valve means 88 to be received in the seat provided by o - ring 92 thereby preventing air from passing through the air passage 66 into the chamber 52 . although an elastic o - ring is preferred as the annular valve member 72 of the first valve means 70 , it would be possible , though less desirable , to provide a substantially inelastic annular valve member , for example one of ptfe or nylon , and an at least resiliently and , preferably , elastically deformable , beveled valve seat 82 which is outwardly expanded into contact with the inner circumferential surface of the chamber 52 when the valve member 72 is seated against the valve seat 82 by compressed air in the chamber 52 for sealing the annular gap 120 seen in fig3 . similarly , although a frustoconical beveled surface is preferred for the valve seat 82 , other sloping surface configurations may be employed . while the disclosed pump is eminently suitable for manual operation and for use as the seat post of a bicycle , the pump 10 may be modified for automatic , mechanical reciprocation and may be modified to pump other fluids , namely liquids . from the foregoing description , it can be seen that the present invention provides a unique , versatile , and manually operable pump , which can be configured as a bicycle air pump possessing significant advantages over conventional bicycle air pumps . while various modifications have been described and / or suggested , one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that changes could be made to the above - described embodiment of the invention without departing from the broad inventive concepts thereof . it is understood , therefore , that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiment ( s ) disclosed , but is intended to cover any modifications which are within the scope and spirit of the invention , as defined by the appended claims .",1
"fig2 is a block diagram of a memory system 200 according to one embodiment of the present invention . the memory system 200 includes a master device 210 ( e . g ., a memory controller ) coupled to a plurality of memory devices 260 a – 260 i via a communication path formed by a primary channel 215 and stick channels 275 a – 275 d . in one embodiment , the master device , transceivers and memory devices transmit signals on the communication path through current - mode signaling . that is , each conductor in a given channel 275 a – 275 d is pulled up to a predetermined voltage level through a termination impedance and may be driven to at least one lower voltage level by sinking an appropriate amount of current . although the termination impedances are depicted in fig2 as being coupled to the ends of the channels 275 a – 275 d , the termination impedances may alternatively be placed at any point along their respective channels , including within the master device 210 , or within a transceiver or memory device coupled to the channel . in an alternative embodiment , voltage mode signaling may be used in which the master device , transceivers and memory devices output digital voltage levels to the bus to effect digital signaling . in voltage mode embodiments , the bus may be allowed to float or the bus may be pulled up or down through termination impedances . in the embodiment of fig2 , a clock generator 230 generates a clock signal 240 called clock - to - master ( ctm ) that propagates toward master device 210 . a second clock signal 250 , preferably having the same frequency as ctm 240 , propagates away from the master device 210 and is called clock - from - master ( cfm ). ctm 240 is used to clock the transmission of information to master device 210 on the primary channel 215 , while cfm 250 is used to clock transmission of information from the master device 210 to memory device 260 a and transceivers 220 a and 220 b . together ctm and cfm provide for source synchronous transmission of data ( i . e ., data travels with clock ) in both directions on the primary channel 215 . in one embodiment , ctm 240 and cfm 250 are the same signal , with the conductors that carry cfm 250 and ctm 240 being coupled to one another at or near the master device 210 ( e . g ., within the master device 210 , at a pin of the master device 210 or at another point just outside the master device 210 ). in alternative embodiments , clock signals ctm 240 and cfm 250 may be separately generated . for example , master device 210 may include a clock generator circuit that generates cfm 250 in a predetermined phase relationship to ctm 240 . regardless of whether ctm 240 and cfm 250 are the same signal or separately generated , ctm 240 and cfm 250 will have a different phase relationship at different points along the primary channel due to the fact that they are traveling in different directions . for example , if cfm and ctm are in phase at master device 210 , then at transceiver 220 b , they will be out of phase by the amount of time it takes for ctm 240 to travel from the transceiver 220 b to the master 210 plus the time it takes for cfm 250 to travel from the master 210 to the transceiver 220 b . this phase difference between ctm and cfm , referred to herein as t tr , is different at each point along the primary channel . each of transceivers 220 a – 220 c serves as a bi - directional repeater between a host channel ( i . e ., a channel used to deliver signals from the master device 210 ) and at least one stick channel . more specifically , transceiver 220 b serves as a bi - directional repeater between host channel 215 ( the primary channel ) and stick channel 275 c ; transceiver 220 c serves as a bi - directional repeater between host channel 275 c and stick channel 275 d ; and transceiver 220 a serves as a bi - directional repeater between host channel 215 and each of stick channels 275 a and 275 b . in one embodiment , each of the transceivers 220 a – 220 d provides regenerative gain and drive capability and resynchronizes signal transmissions between the clock domain of the host channel and the stick channel . it should be noted that the channel topology depicted in fig2 is merely an example — numerous alternative channel topologies may be constructed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention . by using transceivers 220 a – 220 d to segment the overall communication path into multiple segments , the resistive and capacitive loading of any given length of the communication path may be kept below a tolerable threshold . this permits the communication path to be extended to support more memory devices without unacceptable loss of signal margin due to resistive or capacitive loading . although each of transceivers 220 a – 220 c is shown in fig2 as supporting one or two stick channels , a given transceiver may support any number of stick channels up to a practical limit . also , though the primary channel 215 and stick channels 275 a – 275 d are each shown as supporting one or two memory devices , more memory devices may be supported by the channel segments in alternate embodiments . similarly , any number of transceivers up to a practical limit may be hosted by a given channel segment . in one embodiment , each of the transceivers uses the clock signals that correspond to its host channel to generate one or more clock signals for the stick channel ( or channels ) that it serves . for example , transceiver 220 b generates a clock signal “ clock - to - end ” ( cte ) 270 c based on clock signals ctm 240 and cfm 250 . cte 270 c is folded back at the end of stick channel 275 c to provide clock signal “ clock - to - transceiver ” ( ctt ) 280 c , which in turn is used to generate clock signal “ clock - from - transceiver ( cft ) 290 c . similarly , transceiver 220 c generates clock signals cte 270 d , ctt 280 d and cft 290 d based on clock signals ctt 280 c and cft 290 c , and transceiver 220 a generates clock signals cte 270 a , ctt 280 a , cft 290 a , cte 270 b , ctt 280 b and cft 290 b from clock signals ctm 240 and cfm 250 . the relationship between ctm 240 and cfm 250 described above applies to the clock signals ctt and cft generated for each stick channel . for example , in the embodiment of fig2 , ctt and cft for a given stick channel are the same signal , with their respective conductors being coupled together at or near the transceiver for the stick channel ( e . g ., within the transceiver , at a pin of the transceiver or at another point just outside the transceiver ). in alternative embodiments , ctt and cft may be separately generated . for example , a given transceiver may include a clock generator circuit that generates cft in a predetermined phase relationship to ctt . regardless of whether ctt and cft are the same signal or separately generated , ctt and cft will have a different phase relationship at different points along the stick channel they serve . this phase difference between ctt and cft for a given stick channel is analogous to the phase difference , t tr , between ctm 240 and cfm 250 discussed above , and is referred to herein as t - stick tr . as discussed below , transceivers 220 a – 220 d perform a latency alignment function by adjusting the transfer latency from host channel to stick channel according to the phase difference between the host channel &# 39 ; s clocks ( i . e ., t tr when the host channel is the primary channel 215 and t - stick tr when the host channel is a stick channel ). in one embodiment , the cft and ctt clocks on stick channels ( stick clocks ) are synchronized to ctm 240 on the primary channel 215 . requests / commands from the master device 210 are received with cfm and resynchronized to cft for retransmission on the stick channel . this timing relationship is discussed below in further detail . fig3 a is a timing diagram of a data transfer operation in the memory system 200 of fig2 . more specifically , fig3 a illustrates the timing of a data transfer from memory device 260 g to master device 210 . data c is available on stick channel 275 c at the falling edge of stickclk 330 . in the embodiment shown , txclk 320 is the equivalent of ctm 240 and stickclk 330 is 180 degrees out of phase with txclk 320 . data c is transferred onto the primary channel 215 at the second falling edge of txclk 320 at time t 2 . the overall propagation delay from the primary channel 215 to the stick channel 275 ( i . e ., the latency incurred crossing transceiver 220 b ) is t lat ( sp ) . in the embodiment shown , t lat ( sp ) is 1 . 5 clock cycles in duration . fig3 b illustrates the timing of a data transfer in the opposite direction — from master device 210 to memory device 260 g . the primary channel 215 has data a on it at a first time , at a falling edge of rxclk 310 . for one embodiment , rxclk 310 is equivalent to cfm 250 . cfm 250 lags ctm 240 by time t tr so that rxclk 310 lags txclk 320 by time t tr . as discussed above , time t tr is twice the time of flight down the bus , which is the difference in phase between ctm and cfm at the pin of the slave device ( transceiver ). generally period t tr should be less than one cycle ( e . g . 0 . 8 t cycle ), otherwise the timing relationship may be confusing ( i . e . 2 . 2 cycles looks just like 0 . 2 cycles ). in alternative embodiments , circuitry for tracking multiple cycles may be used so that t tr need not be limited to less than a clock cycle . at the falling edge of rxclk 310 , data a is available to the transceiver . for one embodiment , transceiver latches data a at this time . the data a is available on the stick channel 275 c on the falling edge f of stick clock 330 , after the rising edge 2 r . the overall propagation delay from the primary channel 215 to the stick channel 275 c is t lat ( ps ) . fig3 c is a timing diagram of a data transfer from the master device 210 to the memory device 260 g when t tr is relatively large ( e . g ., 0 . 8 tcycle ). as shown , data b is available on primary channel 215 at a falling edge of rxclk 310 and then on the stick channel 275 c at time t 2 , the first falling edge after the second rising edge 2 r of stickclk 330 . the overall propagation delay from the primary channel 215 to the stick channel 275 is t lat ( ps ) . referring to fig3 b and 3c , it can be seen that the transfer latency from primary channel to stick channel ( t lat ( ps ) ) is dependent upon the time t tr . more specifically , t lat ( ps ) is given by a predetermined number of clock cycles less the round trip time on the channel between the transceiver and the master device , t tr . in an embodiment having the timing characteristic shown in fig3 b and 3c , the latency incurred crossing the transceiver in the direction of the stick channel may be expressed mathematically as t lat ( ps ) = 2 . 5 cycles − t tr . accordingly , when t tr is larger , t lat ( ps ) is smaller ( compare fig3 b and 3c ). thus , the transceiver 220 b effectively adjusts the time delay to repeat signals from the primary channel 215 on the stick channel 275 c to compensate for the flight time down the primary channel in each direction . the result of this compensation is that the roundtrip latency between the master device and a stick channel ( not counting t - stick tr or the latency required for the target memory device to respond ) is aligned to a clock cycle boundary . said another way , the round - trip latency between the master device and a stick channel is independent of the distance on the primary channel between the transceiver and the master device 210 . fig4 illustrates the response latency of a memory transaction in greater detail . as shown , the overall response latency perceived by the master device is made up of the following latencies : note that , because the time to cross the transceiver 220 from primary channel 215 to stick channel 275 is compensated to account for the round trip flight time on the primary channel ( t tr ), the primary channel flight time does not appear in the expression for total latency . more specifically , the round - trip latency between the master device 210 and the stick channel 275 ( i . e ., node n ) is equal to x + y cycles . by selecting x and y to add to a whole number of clock cycles , the round - trip latency between the master device 210 and the stick channel 275 is effectively aligned with a clock for the primary channel ( ctm 240 in the embodiment of fig2 ). that is , the round - trip time from the master device 210 to a given stick channel is aligned on a clock cycle boundary . as discussed below , this latency alignment simplifies timing in the memory system significantly , allowing more efficient bandwidth utilization on the primary channel and stick channels than is achieved with the above - described prior art techniques . referring to fig2 , for example , by choosing x to be 2 . 5 clock cycles and y to be 1 . 5 clock cycles ( the timing shown in fig3 a and 3b ), the roundtrip latency between master device 210 and any one of stick channels 275 a , 275 b and 275 c is aligned with every fourth clock cycle of ctm 240 . consequently , the master device 210 may use the four clock cycles which follow a transmission to any of memory devices 260 b – 260 i to transmit or receive other information on the primary channel 215 . fig5 illustrates the scaleability of the above - described latency alignment technique and the manner in which programmable latency registers may be used in conjunction with latency - aligning transceivers to establish a flat response latency over an entire memory system . memory system 700 includes a number of transceivers ( t 1 – t 5 ) that each serve as bi - directional repeaters for respective stick channels ( 775 a – 775 e ). transceivers t 1 , t 3 and t 5 are each coupled to the primary channel 715 and include latency alignment circuitry that aligns the round - trip latency between the master device and stick channels 775 a , 775 c and 775 e , respectively , to an integer number of clock cycles , n . transceivers t 2 and t 4 are hosted by stick channels 775 a and 775 c , respectively , and include latency alignment circuitry that aligns the round - trip latency between the respective masters ( t 1 and t 3 ) for their host channels and stick channels 775 b and 775 d to the integer number of clock cycles , n . in one embodiment , n is equal to four so that the round - trip latency between master device 210 and stick channel 775 a is four clock cycles and the round - trip latency between master device 210 and stick channel 775 b is eight clock cycles . more generally , the latency from the master device 210 to a given stick channel is m × n , where m is the number of transceivers that must be crossed to reach the stick channel , and n is the latency - aligned , round - trip time from a master of a given host channel to a stick channel that is coupled to the host channel through a single transceiver . note that no matter how many transceivers must be crossed in the memory system of fig5 , the overall round - trip time between master device 210 and any stick channel in the memory system is aligned with the transmit clock of master device 210 ( e . g ., cfm 250 in fig2 ). this enables construction of memory systems having large numbers of memory devices (“ mem ” in fig5 ) without loss of determinism in system timing . the intervals between command and response transmissions are well defined and may therefore be used for command and response pipelining . another benefit of the above - described latency - aligning tranceivers is that they may be used in conjunction with programmable - latency memory devices to provide a memory system with flat latency response . that is , the response latency of all memory devices may be made substantially equal , regardless of their proximity to the master device 210 . referring to fig5 , for example , memory devices hosted by stick channels 775 a , 775 c and 775 e may be programmed to delay their outputs by four clock cycles so that the overall response latency for all memory devices in the memory system is substantially equal ( with sub - clock cycle variance due to relative positions of memory devices on their stick channels ). expressed analytically , the total response delay perceived by the master device 210 is : where t dev — prog is the number of additional cycles of delay programmed within a given memory device , m is the number of transceivers that must be crossed to reach the stick channel that hosts the target memory device , and n is the latency - aligned , round - trip time from a master of a host channel to a stick channel coupled to the host channel through a single transceiver . thus , to provide a flat response latency throughout the memory system , the delay time ( t dev — prog ) for each memory device in the memory system may be set as follows : in this way , the total response latency will be substantially the same for each memory device in the memory system , regardless of the number of memory devices or stick channels in the memory system . fig6 is a block diagram of a transceiver according to one embodiment . the transceiver 220 receives the ctm 240 and cfm 250 clock signals from the master device . the transceiver 220 further receives host channel 410 . host channel 410 transmits address and data information from the master device to the transceiver 220 . for one embodiment , host channel 410 is a parallel bus , having multiple conductors . for another embodiment , host channel 410 is a serial communication path . for another embodiment , host channel 410 may include multiple buses , such as an address bus and a separate data bus , or even multiple control paths . the transceiver 220 acts as a slave device toward the master device 210 and includes a slave interface 420 to receive data and control signals from the master device via host channel 410 . to the master device , the transceiver 220 appears to be a memory device . requests from the master device arrive at the transceiver in the cfm 250 timing domain , and responses are sent back to the master in the ctm 240 timing domain . the master device 210 does not need to be modified to interact with the transceiver . on the stick channel 490 , the transceiver 220 functions as a master device , providing a master interface 430 to retransmit the requests / commands from the master device to the memory devices ( or transceivers ) coupled to stick channel 490 , and to forward responses from the memory devices to the master device via the slave interface 420 and host channel 410 . the memory devices perceive no difference in system operation resulting from the presence of transceiver 220 and therefore require no design modification . the transceiver 220 provides the clock - from - transceiver ( cft ) 290 and clock - to - transceiver ( ctt ) 280 signals to the memory devices and transceivers coupled to channel 490 . in one embodiment , cte 270 is routed to the end of the stick channel where it is folded back to provide ctt 280 . as discussed above , ctt 280 is folded back away from the transceiver 220 to provide cft 290 . data is transmitted to devices coupled to stick channel 490 in the cft 290 clock domain and received from devices coupled to stick channel 490 in the ctt 280 clock domain . for one embodiment , the transceiver 220 includes a stick transceiver 440 and a host transceiver 450 . the stick transceiver 440 transmits and receives data on the stick channel 490 . the host transceiver 450 transmits and receives data on the host channel 410 . the transceiver 220 further includes a first synchronizing unit 460 . the synchronizing unit 460 synchronizes data transmitted from the memory channel to the stick channel to the cft 290 . for one embodiment , the transceiver 220 may also include a second synchronizing unit 470 for synchronizing signals transmitted from the stick channel 490 to the host channel 410 with ctm 240 . for one embodiment , the second synchronizing unit 470 may be omitted if the ctt clock is synchronized with one of the clocks on the memory channel ( e . g ., in an embodiment in which the stick clocks ctt and cft are synchronized with ctm 240 ). the transceiver 220 further includes an isolation unit 480 that operates to prevent the transceiver 220 from repeating signals onto either the host channel 410 or the stick channel 490 . for one embodiment , the isolation unit 480 asserts an isolate signal 595 to force both sets of bus driver circuits into a high - impedance ( non - driving ) state . using the isolate feature , the transceiver 220 can effectively split a memory system into two partitions . in normal operation ( not isolated ), the transceiver 220 passes packets between the two partitions and the channel functions normally . when the transceiver &# 39 ; s isolation unit 480 is enabled , the two partitions become electrically isolated and , if desired , each individual section can operate independently . this may be advantageous in certain graphics applications , for example with a frame buffer and normal ( code and data ) drams sharing a single channel partitioned by a transceiver . the transceiver 220 further includes a power logic 485 for turning off the transceiver 220 when it does not need to transmit . in one embodiment , power logic 485 merely turns off the stick transceiver 440 , so that signals received via host channel 410 are not retransmitted on stick channel 490 . circuitry may be provided to interpret incoming addresses to determine whether they decode to memory devices coupled to stick channel 490 ( or downstream stick channels ). stick transceiver 440 may then be selectively enabled and disabled depending on whether memory devices coupled to stick channel 490 are being addressed . for example , if a certain amount of time passes ( or transactions detected ) without memory devices coupled to stick channel 490 being addressed , power unit 485 may disable stick transceiver 440 to save power . alternatively , transceiver 220 may power down stick transceiver 440 and other circuitry within transceiver 220 in response to a power - save command received on the host channel 410 . also , in alternative embodiments , transceiver 220 may remain fully enabled at all times and power unit 485 may be omitted altogether for one embodiment the transceiver 220 does not interpret incoming transmissions on the host channel and therefore does not respond to commands . that is , the transceiver 220 cannot be “ addressed ” by a master device ( e . g ., device 210 of fig2 ). consequently , in this embodiment the transceiver 220 does not include registers which may be read or written by a master device . in alternative embodiments , the transceiver 220 include command interpretation circuitry for parsing packetized commands or other transmissions received on the host channel . in these embodiments , the transceiver 220 may perform timing adjustments or other operations in response to commands from a master device . for example , the transceiver 220 may perform output driver calibration or other signal parameter calibration operations in response to commands from the master device . also , instead of calibration , the transceiver 220 may receive control parameters from the master device and install them in appropriate registers to provide master - specified signal adjustments ( e . g ., adjustments to slew rate , drive strength , receive and transmit timing , equalization , reference voltage adjustment , clock duty cycle correction and so forth ). moreover , as discussed above , the transceiver 220 may enter a power - saving state in response to commands received on the host channel . fig7 illustrates the synchronization and transceiver logic of a transceiver 220 according to one embodiment . the transceiver 220 receives a host channel 570 that couples the transceiver 220 to a master device along with signal lines for clock signals ctm 240 and cfm 250 . though not shown , the transceiver 220 may also include isolation circuitry and power saving circuitry as described above in reference to fig6 . the transceiver 220 also receives signal lines for clock signals cte 580 , ctt 585 and cft 590 along with a stick channel 575 that couples the transceiver 220 to memory devices and / or other transceivers . the transceiver 220 includes a phase locked loop ( pll ) 510 which performs a clock recovery function , generating a buffered output 512 in phase alignment with cfm 250 . this recovered version of cfm 250 is input to the primary receiver 515 where it is used to time reception of signals from the host channel 570 . the transceiver 220 also includes pll 525 to generate a recovered version of ctm 240 ( i . e ., buffered output 527 ) for clocking primary transmitter 520 . a pll 550 is used to generate cte 580 for the stick channel such that ctt 585 arrives at the transceiver 180 degrees out of phase with ctm 240 . this inverted version of ctm 240 is designated “ stick clock ” in fig7 . pll 545 is also used to generate a clock signal 529 that is 180 degrees out of phase with ctm 240 ( i . e ., in phase with the stick clock ) for clocking the secondary receiver 540 . the 180 degree phase offset between ctm 240 and the stick clock permits the latency between reception of signals in secondary receiver and retransmission of the signals at the primary transmitter 520 to be aligned on half - clock cycle boundaries ( e . g ., 1 . 5 clock cycles as shown in fig3 a ). because transceiver 220 receives data from the host channel 570 in response to edges of cfm 250 and then retransmits the data on the stick channel in response to edges of ctm 240 , the time required to cross the transceiver in the direction of the stick channel ( t lat ( ps ) ) is compensated by the amount of time by which cfm 250 lags ctm 240 . that is , t lat ( ps ) is equal to the number of cycles of ctm 240 that transpire during the transceiver crossing , less t tr . by contrast , data crossing the transceiver in the direction of the host channel 570 is both received and retransmitted in response to clock edges aligned with edges of ctm 240 ( stickclk being an inverted version of ctm 240 ). that is , t lat ( sp ) is equal to the number of cycles of ctm 240 consumed crossing the transceiver without compensation for t tr . this asymmetry between t lat ( ps ) and t lat ( sp ) results in a bidirectional transceiver crossing time that includes compensation for t tr , thus causing the round - trip latency between the master device and a given stick channel to be aligned to the ctm 240 clock . transceiver 220 also includes a re - timing circuit 530 that delays the data transfer between the primary receiver 515 and the secondary transmitter 535 when t tr becomes so small that half clock cycle boundary may be crossed . more specifically , re - timing circuit 530 determines the phase difference ( t tr ) between the recovered versions of ctm 240 and cfm 250 and selects between a delayed and a non - delayed path for transferring data from primary receiver 515 to secondary transmitter 535 , ensuring that the overall t lat ( ps ) is a fixed number of clock cycles less t tr . fig8 is a diagram of a transceiver that includes circuitry for preventing a latch - up condition . latch - up occurs when data received from a first channel and transmitted to the second channel is detected on the second channel , and promptly retransmitted to the first channel . this feedback latches the device into a state . portions of the transceiver have been omitted from fig8 for simplicity . only the primary receiver 515 , primary transmitter 520 , secondary transmitter 535 , secondary receiver 540 , and re - timer 530 are shown . a latch - up prevention logic 610 is placed between primary receiver 515 and primary transmitter 520 . a similar latch - up prevention logic 620 is placed between secondary transmitter 535 and secondary receiver 540 . the latch - up prevention logic 610 receives an input from the primary receiver 515 and from the secondary receiver 540 . the output of the latch - up prevention logic 610 is coupled to a disable logic ( dl ) 630 in the primary transmitter 520 . similarly , the latch - up prevention logic 620 receives an input from the secondary receiver 540 and the primary receiver 515 . the output of the latch - up prevention logic 620 is coupled to a disable logic ( dl ) 640 in the secondary transmitter 535 . pin 680 is coupled to the host channel 570 ( not shown ), while pin 690 is coupled to stick channel 575 ( not shown ). when the primary receiver 515 receives data from the host channel 570 , it sends a disable signal through node 517 to the latch - up prevention logic 610 . the latch - up prevention logic 610 sends a disable signal to the primary transmitter &# 39 ; s disable logic 630 . the disable logic 630 prevents the primary transmitter 520 from transmitting information received from the secondary transceiver 540 for a period of time . the disable signal is also sent to the disable logic ( dl ) 625 of latch - up prevention logic 620 . the disable signal turns off the latch - up prevention logic 620 . the data received by the primary receiver 515 is transmitted , through the secondary transmitter 535 to the stick channel . when the secondary receiver 540 receives the same data from the stick channel , the latch - up prevention logic 620 is already disabled , preventing the turning off of the secondary transmitter 535 . furthermore , the primary transmitter 520 is already disabled , preventing the retransmission of the data to the host channel . in this manner , the latch - up prevention logic 610 prevents the system latch up . the latch - up prevention logic 610 , 620 releases their transmitter , 520 and 535 respectively , after the entire data is transmitted by the primary receiver 515 . similarly , if data is first received on the stick channel by the secondary receiver , latch - up prevention logic 620 disables secondary transmitter 535 through disable logic 640 . the disable signal further disables latch - up prevention logic 610 through disable logic 615 . using the above - described latch - up prevention logics , the danger of latch - up is avoided . for one embodiment , the latch - up prevention logic 610 may be implemented as an and gate and an inverter , such that the output of the secondary receiver 540 is inverted , and coupled as an input to an and gate . the other input to the and gate is the logic from the primary receiver 515 . in this way , only when the output of the primary receiver 515 is on , while the output of the secondary receiver 540 is off , does the latch - up prevention logic 610 output its disable signal . although the exemplary embodiments of latency - aligning receivers and systems and methods for incorporating latency - aligning receivers have been described in terms of memory systems . it will be appreciated that the concepts and principles disclosed are not limited to memory systems , but rather may be applied in any system where it is desirable to increase the number of devices attached to a communication path without overloading the communication path or complicating system timing . more generally , though the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof , it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims . the specification and drawings are , accordingly , to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense .",6
"fig1 illustrates an image - guided surgery system with which the present invention may be employed . the system includes a surgical or medical instrument 11 , such as an endoscope , having an elongate axis 12 and tip 13 , which is used to probe an internal target site 14 of a patient 15 . a plurality of fiducials or markers 16 are placed on the patient 15 near the target site . the fiducials are used to register corresponding points on the preoperative or intraoperative 2 - d image scans of patient target site 14 . instrument 11 has a plurality of tracking elements 17 on its shaft 12 which emit signals to sensors 33 positioned in view of the instrument . both the instrument and the sensors are in communication with a tracking controller which is in communication with a computer system that processes the signals received by sensors 33 to track the movement of instrument 11 during surgery . the tracking controller may be a separate element or it may be physically integrated with the computer system and may even be embodied in an option card which is inserted into an available card slot in the computer . the computer system is also used to render and display the 2 - d preoperative or intraoperative images and render 3 - d surface or volumetric images , either of which may be perspective or orthographic , of target site 14 on a display device . various aspects of the image - guided surgery procedure , such as registration , tracking , image generation and navigation , may be implemented by a program of instructions ( e . g ., software ) in response to user input supplied by various input devices such as a keyboard , mouse , track ball or joystick . the software is executed by a processor , such as a central processing unit ( cpu ) which may be in the form of a microprocessor . other processors may also be used in conjunction with the cpu such as a graphics chip . as shown in fig1 a dynamic frame - of - reference ( dfr ) 21 is rigidly attached to a support 22 that is securely attached to the portion of patient 15 ( e . g ., head 23 ) where the surgery is to be performed . thus , when the patient &# 39 ; s head moves , support 22 and dfr 21 also move . securely attached to the dfr is a rigid elongated element 24 extending outwardly from a main surface of dfr 21 at a known angle and terminating in a tip 25 at its distal end . dfr 21 includes a plurality of sensors 35 in communication with tracking controller which is also in communication with the computer system , instrument 11 and sensors 33 to determine the location and orientation of the dfr including element 24 and its tip 25 . in accordance with one variation of the preferred embodiment of the invention , a pointer 26 has its tip 27 attached to one end of an elastic , telescopic or otherwise length - adjustable potentiometer 28 or equivalent device , the other end of which is attached to tip 25 . if pointer 26 is not attached to dfr 21 , then the pointer will include tracking elements / position sensors 26 a that are in communication with sensors 33 and the computer system to track the movement and determine the position and orientation of the pointer . the remaining figures . taken in conjunction with fig1 describe the various embodiments of the invention . fig2 illustrates a first mode of operation in accordance with embodiments of the invention . first , the user selects a target point 29 in patient target site 14 and establishes the orientation of the instrument view axis ( e . g ., the endoscope view axis ) with respect to target point 29 . next , selected preoperative or intraoperative scan data representing internal scans of the patient target site are used to construct an image of the patient target site , with respect to the orientation of the instrument , such as viewed along the view axis of the instrument . that is , the constructed image is orthogonal to the view axis of the instrument but is viewed along the axis of the instrument . the image is then displayed in various 2 - d orientations and in 3 - d on the display device for viewing by the user . fig3 illustrates a second mode of operation , in accordance with embodiments of the invention , where a view orientation with respect to a virtual target point 31 , external to the patient , is transformed to a view orientation with respect to a selected target point 29 in the patient . the virtual target point may be established at any external location that can be determined relative to the tracking system , e . g ., relative to dfr 21 . for example , virtual target point 31 can be at the tip of elongated support 24 as shown in fig1 or it can be located in free space and initially defined by the tip of pointer 26 . as illustrated in fig3 the user selects an orientation with which to view the virtual target point and the corresponding image of patient target site 14 . the view orientation of the virtual target point is defined by an imaginary line extending between a known point on the pointer , e . g ., its tip 27 and virtual target point 31 . thus , selecting the view orientation also involves selecting the location of the virtual target point , if it is not at a fixed location , e . g ., at the tip of the elongated support , as shown in fig1 . the virtual target point can be defined in free space by moving the tip of the pointer to the desired point in space and clicking a selector button on pointer 26 to establish virtual target 31 point at the tip of the pointer . the virtual target point will remain at that location even after the pointer is moved , until a new virtual target point is established by the user . the selected view orientation and virtual target point location is then input into the computer where this information is processed and stored . in particular , the computer establishes a correspondence between selected target point 29 in patient target site 14 and virtual target point 31 in “ virtual ” space , which may be accomplished , for example , using point - to - point mapping . point - to - point mapping essentially involves determining a transformation matrix that maps the coordinates of point 29 to another set of coordinates representing point 31 . a transformation is then made between the view orientation with respect to virtual target point 31 and the view orientation with respect to selected point 29 . scan data is used to construct an image of the patient target site , as viewed along the view orientation with respect to the virtual target point . the image is then displayed on the display device . fig4 and 5 illustrate a preferred embodiment of the second mode of operation , where the virtual target point is located a specified distance from a known point on the pointer 26 which is used to view the virtual target point and the corresponding image of the patient target site 14 along the axis of the pointer 26 . it should be noted that in this embodiment as well as in the other disclosed embodiments pointer 26 may be the medical instrument used at the patient target site 14 or it may be a separate instrument . the user selects a target point b in the patient target site 14 that lies on the axis of the instrument 11 at a selected distance d from a known point a on the instrument 11 and inputs this information into the computer . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 of selected point b in the patient target site are determined with respect to known point a . next , the user specifies an external virtual target point b ′ with respect to the axis of pointer 26 . this may be accomplished , for example , by clicking a selector button on pointer 26 to establish b ′ at the tip of the pointer relative to its axis . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 of b are transformed to a second set of coordinates x 1 ′, y 1 ′, z 1 ′ representing b ′ to establish correspondence between points b and b ′ in their respective spaces . a transformation is then made between the view orientation along the axis of pointer 26 with respect to point b ′ at distance d ′ and the view orientation along the axis of instrument 11 with respect to point b at distance d , where d and d ′ may or may not be equal . these transformations establish correspondence between the two view orientations , so that the view that the user sees along the axis of pointer 26 at distance d ′ is the same view as the user sees ( or would see ) along the axis of instrument 11 at distance d in the corresponding view orientation . now , as pointer 26 is moved , say , counterclockwise through an angle θ to the position shown in fig5 the user now sees patient target site 14 through point b ′ as if instrument 11 was moved that same angular distance to the position shown in a dashed line in fig5 . also , if the user were to move pointer 26 along its axis , say away from b ′ thereby increasing d ′, the user would view target site 14 as if instrument 11 was also moved along its axis away from b to increase d . the computer may maintain a constant ratio between d and d ′, or alternatively may employ other linear or nonlinear mathematical relationships between d and d ′ in correlating the view distances . scan data is used to construct images of the patient target site 14 , as viewed along the axis of the pointer 26 , with respect to b ′ , and these images are displayed on the display device . a variation on the above - described embodiment is to use a “ universal swivel ” device connecting the tip of elongated element 24 ( which in this case represents virtual target point b ′) to the tip of the pointer 26 ( point a ′ in fig5 ). the universal swivel device may be potentiometer 28 or equivalent device . here , point b ′ is at a known location and d ′ may easily be determined using the potentiometer 28 . preferably , the potentiometer is adjustable along its axis to allow the pointer to be moved in and out but keeps the axis of the pointer aligned with the axis of the potentiometer . thus , this arrangement enables pointer 26 to rotate about virtual point b ′ while maintaining co - linearity between any two points on the pointer 26 and b ′. the “ universal swivel ” may also be implemented using a joystick , or similar device . here the ball of the joystick represents virtual target point b ′ and the joystick itself represents pointer 26 . view distance d ′ is fixed and corresponds to some view distance d in the patient target site . the joystick need not be tracked using sensors but would interface with the computer as an input device so that its position can be determined . the user inputs information to the computer to establish distance d ′, a reference view orientation with respect to point b ′, and a corresponding reference joystick position . based on that information , the computer then employs an algorithm to correlate different positions of the joystick with different view orientations with respect to point b ′, which , in turn , is correlated with various view orientations of instrument 11 with respect to target point b . as the joystick is moved , the view orientation that the user sees on the display device changes . the “ universal swivel ” may also be implemented using a track ball as a computer input device . once calibrated , manipulating the track ball can be used to change the view orientation vector a ′ b ′ which is correlated to various view orientations of instrument 11 represented by vector ab . here there is no pointer 26 , and the view orientation with respect to b ′ is relative to the position of the track ball . as with the joystick , view distance d ′ is fixed and corresponds to a view distance d in the patient target site . the user inputs information to the computer to establish d ′ which is correlated with d . in another embodiment of the second mode of operation , which is more general than the first embodiment , a transformation is made between a view orientation with respect to a selected virtual target point and a view orientation with respect a selected patient target site point , where the view orientations may or may not be along the axis of the instrument / pointer . an example of this embodiment is illustrated in fig6 and 7 , where the view orientation with respect to the target point is along the axis of the instrument but the view orientation with respect to the virtual target point is not along the axis of the pointer . this is merely one example of this embodiment ; other variations are possible . referring now specifically to fig6 and 7 , the user supplies input specifying a target point b in patient target site 14 , where b is defined relative to the instrument , e . g ., b lies along the axis of the instrument 11 . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 of selected point b in the patient target site are determined with respect to the position of the instrument . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 and a distance d may be determined relative to a known point , say a , on the tip of instrument 11 . the imaginary line between b and a defines the view orientation with respect to the selected patient target site point . next , the user specifies an external virtual target point b ′ with respect to the position of pointer 26 . this may be accomplished , for example , by using a position selector on the pointer as previously described . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 are transformed to a second set of coordinates x 1 ′, y 1 ′, z 1 ′ representing b ′, and the view orientation in the “ virtual ” space is determined by the line between a ′ and b ′. a transformation is then made between the view orientation defined by vector a ′ b ′ and the view orientation defined by vector ab . thus , as the tip of pointer 26 is moved , say , counterclockwise through an angle θ , as shown in fig7 the user now sees patient target site 14 as if instrument 11 were moved that same angular distance to the position shown in dashed lines in fig7 . that is , view orientation a ′ 2 b ′ in the “ virtual ” space corresponds to view orientation a 2 b in the “ real ” space . scan data is used to construct images of the patient target site 14 , as viewed along the transformed view orientation , and these images are displayed on the display device . in another embodiment of the second mode of operation , a transformation is made between a view orientation along the axis of pointer 26 and a view orientation along the axis of instrument 11 . here , the view orientations are maintained along the axis of the instrument and the pointer respectively but not necessarily with respect to points b and b ′ when the pointer 26 is moved . an example of this embodiment is illustrated in fig8 and 9 . this is merely one example of this embodiment ; other variations are possible . referring now specifically to fig8 and 9 , the user supplies input specifying a patient target site point b along the axis of instrument 11 a specified distance d from a known point , say a , on the instrument . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 of the selected point b are determined with respect to a known point , say a , on the instrument . next , the user specifies an external virtual target point b ′ with respect to the axis of pointer 26 , as previously described with regard to the first embodiment . the coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 are transformed to a second set of coordinates x 1 , y 1 , z 1 representing b ′. a transformation is then made between the view orientation along the axis of pointer 26 and the view orientation along the axis of instrument 11 . in this embodiment , the view orientations are maintained along the axis of the respective viewing device . thus , if pointer 26 is moved laterally to the right , as shown in fig9 the view orientation remains along the axis of the pointer , and corresponds to the view orientation along the axis of instrument 11 , as if it had been moved laterally to the right the same distance , as shown in dashed line in fig9 . similarly , if pointer 26 is rotated , with or without accompanying lateral motion , the view orientation remains along the axis of the pointer , and corresponds to the view orientation along the axis of instrument 11 , as if it had been moved in the same manner . scan data is used to construct images of the patient target site 14 , as viewed along the transformed view orientation , and these images are displayed on the display device . as previously noted , various aspects of the image - guided surgery procedure , such as registration , tracking , image generation and navigation , may be implemented by a program of instructions ( i . e ., software ). various aspects of the present invention including transforming a target point in a patient target site to an external virtual target point and transforming the corresponding view orientations , which are part of the navigation step , may likewise be implemented by software . software implementing one or more of the various aspects of the present invention may be written to run with existing software used for image - guided surgery . the software for any or all of these tasks of the present invention may be fetched by the cpu from random - access memory ( ram ) for execution . the software may be stored in read - only memory ( rom ) on the computer system and transferred to ram when in use . alternatively , the software may be transferred to ram or directly to the cpu for execution from rom , or through a storage medium such as a disk drive or through an i / o device such as a modem . more broadly , the software may be conveyed by any medium that is readable by the cpu . such media may include , for example , various magnetic media such as disks or tapes , various optical media such as compact disks , as well as various communication paths throughout the electromagnetic spectrum including infrared signals , signals transmitted through a network or the internet , and carrier waves encoded to transmit the software . as an alternative to software implementation , the above - described aspects of the invention may be implemented with functionally equivalent hardware using discrete components , application specific integrated circuits ( asics ), digital signal processing circuits , or the like . such hardware may be physically integrated with the computer processor ( s ) or may be a separate device which may be embodied on a computer card that can be inserted into an available card slot in the computer . thus , the above - described aspects of the invention can be implemented
