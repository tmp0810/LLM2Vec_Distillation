3,"I came here for lunch, and for $20 it was well worth it. They had a pretty good selection of food, and everything I had was great. Near the back, you will drool as you watch the cooks grill tasty meats. There was also the standard king crab legs and shrimp, even for lunch. A few things that stood out for me were the pot pies and the custom-made crepes. I think I'll have to come back here during dinner for round 2."
3,"You must come hungry! There are so many choices, so best to do walk thru first to see what is on offer. Nothing worse than piling lots of food on your plate you won't eat, then getting another plate to try other dishes.\nMy husband doesn't eat meat, gluten, and dairy, so the chef took him for a tour to show him the vegan dishes. So nice this is offered! \nThe dessert is also abundant, do a walk thru with this too. My favorite was the gelato, around 5-6 different flavors. Loved the vanilla bean and coffee. \nI'd come back to this buffet. For all that is offered the price is reasonable. Add $15 for unlimited sparking wine, wine, and beer. I didn't choose it, but it's nice they have that option!"
4,My new favorite pho spot! So glad I discovered this a few weeks ago. I may never drive to Spring Mountain for pho again!\n\nThe pho is top notch with a very flavorful delicious broth and a pretty generous serving. I tried the Bun Bo Hue for the very first time anywhere and now I'm hooked. I usually get the Crispy Imperial Rolls to start off then a nice steaming bowl of one of their savory soups along with a nice Thai ice tea to finish things off. \n\nThe staff is very nice and friendly and are always very attentive. The restaurant is small but cozy and I've never had to wait for a seat so I can straight to the food! I definitely will be a regular here!
0,"Basically, do NOT live here. Management says they have no record of break-ins, yet I was the one who told them about 2 specifically, one being my own place. Horrible management, horrible noise, horrible neighbors. Yeah, the apartments are nice, but who cares about granite countertops when you can't even sleep at night?!"
2,"visited Settebello yesterday for a to-go lunch order.  I went with the \""settebello\"" pizza ($13.50) - sausage, pancetta, mushrooms and pine nuts.  After ordering, walked down to Rocket Fizz to pick-up a few \""artisan\"" sodas.  Returned just in time to pick up pizza and go my way.\n\nI felt the pizza was undercooked - very slight charring on the top of the pizza crust,  The mozzarella was not melted, a boatload of pine nuts, yet very light on mushroom..  Still, the flavors were there - especially liked the sausage and the pancetta.  I'm hoping this is simply a \"" working out the kinks\"" situation yet I wonder since at the time I entered the restaurant, I only saw 3 customers - what happens when there are 30 customers ???\n\nI'll return"
4,"We just love this place so much! Had another delicious bbq meal yesterday. We seem to have our favorites now. He always gets a huge brisket sandwich and the green chili stew, and I always get the half sausage, new potatoes, and cream of corn. *drool* \n\nOh! We also just found out they give military discounts for active or retired!\n\nService - excellent, food - wonderful, atmosphere - fun! This has become one of our favorite places."
1,"Feast for the eyes, this old bank building is a cornucopia of mixed materials from glass to wood to concrete to steel to block to brick and astroturf. Dining a mixed bag, but you're sure to SEE something you like. [blink]\n\n--best seat in thehouse is the corner by the fire\n--bacchi (sp?) Ball court just like home vig location\n--hip urban feel which is difficult to find downtown.\n\n--great service, attentive and super friendly.\n--she even caught the bartender (it was hard to miss) shaking the shit out of my martini, stopped him and made him start over.\n\n--rib eye fatty, not trimmed, and in pieces. Horrible cut.\n--spinach puree very interesting, but doesn't work as presented. (Wants to surround the dish, not be shuffled off on the side)\n--so too go the potatoes. Gratin slightly burned and wants to be as elegant as the architectural lines of the building. Redesign this plate!\n--burger, although ordered medium, arrived charred but RAW!!\n--onion rings nothing to write home about.\n--banana bread pudding rich enough to serve 4. split it, or\n--hot fudge sundae. NICE!\n\nnot many places in town which are Hipster, Trendy, Romantic, Casual AND Classy. Nice hang out."
2,"Decent airport, large, clean and seems to have a lot of decent restaurant options. We loved Blanco in the A-gate area!\n\nI've been here 3 times now - first time was a quick run through, second was a disaster in which I almost missed my flight because of crowds and confusion about which terminal to be in and this time was relatively nice cuz of the great restaurant.. The subsequent hour plus flight delay doesn't appear to be the fault of the airport, but more the fault of US Air, which I am quickly developing a healthy hatred for."
0,"Papa John himself would be disappointed in the level of quality in the pizza's (3) that I received on 08/03/2013. I placed an order online from the 1010 E Desert Inn Rd. location for the special that they had for 3 medium/ 3 topping pizza's thinking that I will do something special for my wife, since she didn't eat anything at work. This was my first time I ever ate Papa John's. Everything was great when ordering and the delivery driver calling to let me know that she is 10 minutes away. When she arrive at our hotel at 7:20PM, I gave her a tip and accepted the pizza's without ever looking at them. As soon as I sat down with my wife in our hotel room, we looked at the pizza's and it looked like the pizza's were cold (cheese getting firm as if it were sitting out long). I called the Papa John's location and spoke with the manager around 7:30PM. He had offered to get new ones sent. I called back at 7:42PM asking the manager if we should give the old pizza's back to the driver that is coming to drop of the new pizza's, he then said that we didn't need to. So my wife and I were so hungry and waited for the pizza's to arrive. We had the opportunity to stare at the cold pizza's and realized how skimpy the toppings were and one of the pizza's looked burnt on the bottom. One pizza for example, had anchovies, chicken and onions. We couldn't even see the chicken and onions, so it looked like an anchovy pizza. I had time to take nice pictures of them. I called the Papa John's location again around 8:32PM. I was so upset that we haven't received the pizza's yet. They said that the driver went to the wrong address and should be there shortly and that the pizza's were piping hot out of the oven. I doubt that they were piping hot, especially arriving late. At 8:44PM, the driver called me and said that he was outside the hotel. I told him to send the pizza's back because it was late already, one hour and 14 minutes later from the time that I called at 7:30PM to get the replacement pizza's. I filled out a feedback form online at the Papa John's website the same night. It is already 08/07/13 and I still haven't received a call from who ever it may concern. I am sorry, but the way that Papa John talks about his business is different from what I experienced. The quality presented by his employee's do not match up to what his values are. I can't say that there were better ingredients if there were hardly any topping on the pizza's."
3,I totally agree with these positive reviews- old school Vegas style that us locals sometimes forget. It warm and inviting. And live music-- ya just never know who you'll bump into. And just wanted to suggest the pizza for tasty takeout-- far better than one of the pizza chains! Still quick and much better variety of toppings that are fresh not canned. And they love garlic like I LOVE garlic!! Yum mm my!
4,"This place is very spacious and the price is very reasonable. I like this storage place, because it's nearby and has easy access whenever I need it."
4,The best homemade Filipino food  since grandmas. The staff was so friendly it's been years since I've had that kind of food so they helped me order which was so helpful .
4,Lobster bisque was delicious\nLobster Salad was SUPERB\nCrab cakes were AWESOME\nSeabass was so buttery\nFilet was wonderful\nTuna tartar was fresh\nService was excellent\n\nTheres a private wine cellar room for private dining. Romantic and really cute spot.\n\nIm def returning for the food!
3,"Before you ask what I was smoking when I gave this Friday's 4 Stars, hear me out.\n\nI came in here for a late dinner during the week. Probably around 9PM.  It wasn't too crowded and we got to sit down right away.\n\nThe service was slow, I think they were probably spread thin. But our waiter was very friendly and other servers seem to help each other out.\n\nThe food was pretty tasty,(I may have been hungry), but never the less I thoroughly enjoyed my Jack Daniels Steak and Shrimp Dinner.\n\nIt did take a while for our food to come out which was surprising since there were not a lot of people in the restaurant, but I have no idea what the kitchen size/situation is for that place."
1,"the food is great, almost always. However, the customer service is horrid, and has been for the past two years. I lived in Chicago previously, and frequented the PF Changs there. The wait staff's attentiveness at that location, which is 100 times busier, was much better. For the price, PF Changs should hire some better wait staff. It has turned us off of one of our favorite restaurants."
3,"As you enter, the pungent odor of the BBQ smoke greets your nose. Most of the customers seem to be local regulars who come for takeout. A few simple booths and a small dining room, walk up ordering, not fancy in the least but great BBQ. We had the sample platter for 4 plus a rack of St. Louis Ribs, sides of hushpuppies fried okra and greens. The okra was our favorite. The ribs were great, as was the pulled pork. The chicken was good but not outstanding. Give it a try for a totally off the strip authentic experience."
1,Really good tacos.\nGeneric beer selection.\nHad a slow/rude/lazy Bartender.
1,"Arrving at Sky Harbor at 1AM was not the issue (it was empty), but my departure back home was almost a complete wreck.\n\nSo apparently this weekend, Nascar (among 1,000 other things) was in town.  I had a 12:40AM to ATL Monday morning.  Leaving Hohokam Park around 9PM (about 6-7 miles from SH), I didn't get to the f'n car rental center (a whole different story) until 10:30.  \n\nWho's genius idea was it to close the airport exit and re-direct traffic from a 4 lane to a one-lane bottleneck into the airport?  That could have been the dumbest, most inefficient thing I have seen since DC shut the interstate near RFK.  Traffic was unbelievable.  And I didn't realize it took another 15 minutes to get to the car rental \""center\"".\n\nAfter finally getting to the terminal, check in was slow, considering the amount of people they should have been expecting (they had red-eyes going to CHI, JFK, and ATL, amongst other places).  Getting to security was ridiculous- I would have rather gotten a handy from TSA then the circus they were running.  Apparently, waving my sunscreen in the air \""who's is this?\""  I should have told them it was my buttplug.   I told them, they said I could check it, but I couldn't let it go.  Cya, sunscreen.  \n\nAnother fascinating aspect was I had my cough syrup, hand sanitizer, and my lighter on me.  They could care less about the lighter.  The hand-gel - gone.  And my syrup, they made me take my stuff, and open it, they were testing it for God-only-knows. They didn't care about checking my ID to make sure the contents were mine though, just to make sure it wasn't on their list?  Is that not ass-backwards?\n\nFinally getting through, there wasn't shit open to eat or shop, a big no-no for people trying to get the hell home- I mean after taking 2 hours to go 6 miles that gets you hungry!\n\nThe actual airport itself was dated in some parts, but it was clean, its only saving grace.\n\nIMO, this place has a long ways to go to be a well oiled machine, which is a huge disappoinment being a gateway to the west."
0,It took 7 minutes to even greet us at the table. All the servers and hospos were up at the front looking at us while we were looking around for a server. To make matters worse during this 7 minutes the manager was check in with all the tables to see how everything was going and skipped our table completely.
4,"Great old fashioned breakfast, nothing fancy just good ol' stick to your ribs grub. Good people working there to... I'm a regular now for sure."
0,"I hate to say it but I agree with the other users.  The cupcakes we received from a groupon were very bland, small, and not up to par with grocery store cakes or cupcakes."
1,Slow disorganized service. Food is ok but nothing special. Our fries were soggy like they had sat under a heat lamp for hours. The tuna melt was dry and the eggs and sausage were dry and bland. Will not return.
3,"This place is tiny.  Don't expect to eat in often.  There's only 6 flavors available and that's really the only issue with this place.  The fruit and dried toppings were good.  I played it safe with Passion Fruit and loved it.  Throw some kiwi, strawberries, pineapple, and gummi bears, I was set.  \n\nI'd give this place another shot for another star.  Hopefully they'll change their flavors up often."
1,We were hungry while waiting for our flight so we decided to give Pwi Wei a try. We ordered the Mandarin Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Steak. The food is extremely salty and greasy.  The only good thing about this place is it's made-to-order so you know the food the food hasn't been sitting there for hours.
1,"First let me start by saying I found Nathalie's by browsing groupon.Prior to purchasing the groupon I called to verify the detail and ensure it covered what I needed (grooming of a lab), I was told yes and set up an appt for the next day. Upon arrival I was told it does NOT cover the cut of a lab and I would incur an extra fee, I was slightly irritated since I had already spoken to someone prior to my purchase but I said ok and asked how much... The response was \""I didn't know you had a groupon, I'm not sure, I'll let you know\"" I didn't like it being left open ended but thought it couldn't be more than $10-20 and I would still be getting a good deal so it's fine and I left her. Let me also add here that prior to leaving and when filling out my paperwork I alerted them my lab is older and her hips are bad to please be careful. A few hours later we came back to pick her up, I was told I needed to pay $35 more for the cut and because they had to hold her up to shave her. That's literally double the cost of the groupon I purchased! Also, my lab is old but she can stand and I have NEVER had a problem or been charged extra for grooming her bc of her age. We were told the normal price for a groom of a lab was $65 (we would be paying $70) and to consider it as getting the spa package for free which was actually supposed to already have been a part of the groupon I had purchased. I asked to speak with the groomer bc I was not paying an extra $35... I agreed to pay extra for the cut but I refused to pay double, I was told she had no idea I had a groupon (not sure why that even matters, a groom is a groom regardless of the payment) no idea it was a lab, or that she was older. I clearly stated a lab when I made my appt, I also let Nathalie know about her hips when I signed her in. The groomer finally agreed and said I did not have to pay the extra $35 but I'm still in awe of the extra money they tried to get out of us. They should not run a groupon if you can't afford to take the loss on money to gain new clients, I felt scammed. I also have to add the job was not done well... After this \""spa package\"" and bath she came home with goop still in her eye, she had some kind of gross something on her tail, and there were several areas of long hair left that was uncut. Nathalie was nice in greeting us, but the groomer was awful and I don't think we will be back..."
3,For $6.00 you get a great car wash that includes someone to hand dry your vechile. It also includes free vacuum use and they literally have 20 covered vacuum stations. They also have a floor mat cleaning machine that you put the mat in and it comes out pretty clean. All included for the price of the wash. Don't forget to get the frequent wash card. Buy 9 washes and the 10th wash is free!
1,"Well I went here last week and the sign said Wok N Grill but since their website says \""Stix\"" and this is the same address, I guess maybe I got it wrong.  Just a heads up, you may see this place named Wok N Grill somewhere down the road.\n\nSo we walked in and the menu is insane.  There is way too much and far too many pictures of the food for anyone to make a reasonable decision.  So I asked the guy \""what's good\"" to which he replied \""besides everything?\""  Oh har har - aren't you clever.  Now I'm pissed at you.  So after trying to drag an answer out of him, I told him I wanted spicy and he suggested boring Kung Pao Chicken.  I took his advice which, now, makes me more mad at him because it really wasn't good.  It was a giant plate of 10000 peanuts, 10 stalks of celery, and some giant mutant chicken.  Was there value for the meal? Sure.  Was it good enough to justify ever eating that much of it?  Absolutely not!  It was decently spicy but, more so, it was just hot.  Like - I stuck this in the microwave for 10 minutes kind of hot.  \n\nLet's just say, I won't be back here.  The staff was unhelpful and the food was insane.  You can usually tell if a place doesn't have good food because they give you a ton of it.  This is one of those places."
3,"Great Service, Great Burgers minus the fries :) oh and Animal Style, at a Great Price!!!  They take pride in their food and customer service and it shows."
2,"I was here today for lunch. Our waitress was brand new and so we had to be a little patient, but she was very friendly and will catch on quickly. That said, I have no complaints about the service, but the food was not anything to write home about. I've eaten here a few times in the past, and I recommend going with one of their top sellers (noted on the menu) - they seem to be top sellers for a reason. Deviating from those doesn't pay off. But they do have outdoor seating, and it is a great place for people watching!"
2,"For $2 a ride, it's a cheap way to see the Strip and the people on it are a mixed crowd.  There was a combination of couples, families, and flat out drunk crazy people.  I really feel sorry for the bus drivers that have to deal with these weird people.  It took about 45 minutes from the front of Paris to  Fremont Street.  The ride is really slow because there are so many stops and traffic get so slow on the Strip.  If you're not in a rush, the Deuce is the way to go."
