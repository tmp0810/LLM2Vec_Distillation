0,"First of all i'm not a big fan of buffet, i tried it because we got a $50 credit for staying here at Monte Carlo in Las Vegas and my friend wanted it so I gave it a chance. Decent taste and There wasn't enough variety of food, service wasn't that great either. so it still doesn't change my mind about buffet."
1,"Thanks Yelp. I was looking for the words to describe this place and Meh seems fitting.\n\nPlayboy club is located under Moon at the Palms. We got in for free thanks to the promoter hookup we got. First you can't take glassware from Moon down to Playboy. Security will take your glass and transfer the contents over to a plastic cocktail cup making you feel like you are a four year old when all of the big kids downstairs have real glassware.\n\nThere are a couple of tables here to gamble along with some video poker machines at the bar in the back of the club. The atmosphere here is relaxed and seems to cater to an older (40+) crowd. the bunnies here looked miserable, and complained about working. YOU ARE A PLAYBOY BUNNIE!! For the love of god TRY to be happy!\n\nI wouldn't come back here if I had to pay to get in, Playboy is rather small, though intimate. There is limited seating available here, and little to no dancing. Stick to here if you want to be able to hear your date and have a relaxing time. Go somewhere else if you are looking to party it up."
2,"Service was so-so. They were receiving a delivery so that might have to do with it. Food was hot and fresh, but we did not do AYCE. The shrimp tempura was good, but the zucchini was a bit oily."
2,"Stamoolis Brothers is one of the Strip District storefronts, specializing in Greek and Mediterranean imports.  They have a good selection of olives, a decent cheese selection, a variety of ready-made dips and spreads which are pretty tasty, and some harder-to-find specialty items like rose water, pomegranate molasses, different grinds of bulgur wheat, bulk fava beans, etc.  You can also get packaged bulk nuts, dried fruits, etc.  When I go in here, it's usually because I'm looking for feta cheese or Greek-style yogurt.\n\nThis place is pretty good.  A couple times I've had some problems getting yogurt here, since they have a tendency to keep the yogurt on the shelf until it's almost at its sell-by date, but on the other hand, they have the cheapest price on Fage yogurt that I've seen in town thus far.  My mom loves a lot of their dips and spreads, so I get snacks from here a lot when she's in town.  The one caution I have (besides the yogurt) is that they sell an inferior brand of canned tomatoes here, which gives off a very strong flavor of metal and ruins your meal."
0,"I want to give a 2 stars because the service staff was friendly and good as well as ambience was decent.  But we came here for food not to meet the staff.  Food was just really mediocre, not even hot.  The hashbrowns taste pre-cut and frozen.  The \""real maple syrup\"" is just a maple syrup blend.  I could make a lot better food myself.  We had pancakes, bacon, and the wolf pack.  All the prices were way too high with food that's more on par with denny's.  Would rather IHOP across the street.   Unfortunately it looks like another lackluster joint resides here (before nypd pizza)."
2,"I don't understand all the hype around this place. Yes it was on TV, but so what? \n\nEach time I go I am disappointed by something. For example, the salmon is typically undercooked and lacking seasoning. I love salmon so I tried it a few times hoping it would improve, but it didn't. Last time, instead of salmon I ordered a grilled wedge salad. It was covered in oil which made it inedible. \n\nThey also almost always mess something up in our take out order. Usually it is something small like giving us regular fries instead of garlic fries, but hey, we pay extra for the garlic! It is frustrating.  \n\nIn my opinion, the food at the Coffee Shop next door is much better."
1,"Two stars for the sandwiches, negative three stars for them never answering their phone."
4,I take my kids here at least two times a week. The staff is sweet and topping selection is awesome! My daughter got the Captain Crunch yogurt and we could not believe how it tasted exactly like the cereal. We love to play with flavor combos every time.
1,"So I have been to Hickory Tavern many many times before. I am actually suprised I havent reviewed it until now. The view of the city is incredible and it is conveniently located in the Met, so we usually hit it before a Trader Joe's grocery shopping trip! \n\nUsually my husband and I get the Build Your Own Salads. 6 ingredients for $9. The oriental dressing is amazing and bacon and avocado on a salad is just A-mazing. In addition, I love that Hickory has Red Oak on tap. They have alot of local beers on draft and I love that about a restaurant.\n\nHowever, this review is more specifically directed to a situation we had today for lunch at HT. My husband and I decided to grab our typical BYO salads. I don't know what was going on but it took a long time to get our food. 25-30 minutes to get a salad is kinda crazy (I mean there wasnt even any cooked meat on it.....all raw ingredients!).Our waitress was super sweet though and came by saying that she had no idea why we hadn't gotten our food yet and that it should be there soon. We finally got our salads and dug in.....yummy dressing! However, about half way into the salad, my husband looks up and pulls out a piece of cardboard from his salad. It was about 2 inches by a half inch. Gross. We have both worked in the food industry and know that those boxes are dragged across the floor when being brought in. All I could picture is that nasty cardboard piece being spread across that whole (since the dressing was tossed into the salad). \n\nThe waitress was, once again, very sweet and didnt really know what to do and grabbed her manager. The manager came out and was talking about boxing up the salad to go. I am assuming she was talking about boxing up a new salad and not the one with the cardboard in it....I dont know. She also offered us a free brownie. Honestly, we didnt really want any other food at the time. They did comp his salad (which was very sweet, hence the 2 stars instead of 1) and charged me for mine. It was just kinda weird. I mean she did apologize but it just came across like it wasnt a big deal. \n\nKinda frustrating that we had this happen cause we LOVED going to Hickory Tavern in the past! I'm not sure if we will be back soon, simply cause I keep picturing that nasty piece of cardboard. Plus, there are so many other places to eat in the Met!"
0,"On 28 June 2013 I checked into the Riviera Hotel and casino until 5 July 2013. After being placed in a downgraded room because my room wasn't available I got settled into room 3533. \nOn 30 June 2013 I went to turn on the floor lamp inside the room and I got a very powerful electric shock. My right hand and arm has very little feeling other than tingling now. I reported the incident immediately to the front desk. A security guard came up to my room and I filed an incident report. She assured me that Risk Management would call me. She took the lamp and told me maintenance would replace the lamp. The lamp wasn't replaced. After going to the ER I was diagnosed with Electric Shock Injury and was told feeling may never come back. I tried calling risk management every day. Finally after 2 days I went to the front desk and demanded to speak to someone regarding my injury. The manager, Debbie, came up and offered to refund my resort fees totaling $115.00 to make up for me losing the feeling in my arm by their faulty equipment in the room. They then upgraded me to the room I was supposed to have the whole time since I paid for an upgraded room. On 4 July 2013 housekeeping came to the room around 11 am. I told her I didn't need housekeeping and she said \""ok\"" and walked away. We left the room around 1:00 and returned around 2:30pm. Upon returning to the room none of the 4 keys we had worked. I went down to the front desk and they gave me 4 more keys. I went back to my room and those keys didn't work. I went back down but this time to the bell desk. I explained what happened and how I already got 4 new keys. He said he'd help and he followed me to my room. His key didn't work. He said something had to be wrong with the lock or mechanism so he left and went to engineering. 30 minutes later 2 security guards (1 male in a black suit and the female security who originally took my injury report) arrived at my room. They told me I was locked out of my room because housekeeping came in to clean and saw my BB gun I had in my room. He told me firearms aren't allowed in the building. I had kept my BB gun in my safe which I kept locked. I told the security how I had told housekeeping I didn't need service earlier. I also told him how my BB gun, which isn't a firearm because it does not use combustion to fire a projectile instead uses air, was locked in my safe and asked how the maid saw my gun and also why was she coming back after I told her I didn't want her in my room. He then told me I was to leave the premises and was banned or \""86'd\"". It took security an additional 30 minutes to get into my room because the door wasn't unlocking. The security guard kept trying to egg me on and asking \""Do you have a chip on your shoulder?\"" \""Are you mad?\"" \""Why are you mad?\"" He had to be asked to leave by the other security guards because he wouldn't stop egging me on. Once inside I saw my safe had been pried open, my BB gun was sitting on top of the safe and the do not disturb sign that was on the door was sitting next to the safe. All the money I had in the safe was taken. I requested to file a report and I was told Risk Management would call me Monday. They never called. They didn't refund me for my extra night stay. I filed a police report with Las Vegas Metro Police. I will never stay at the Riviera. I will never recommend anyone, not even my worst enemy to stay at the Riviera Hotel and Casino Las Vegas!!\n\nAttached is a video taken while security tried to fix the door the broke.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151779810399913&l=1311073713539322341"
2,I have tried Jimmy John's once before and wasn't impressed by my sandwich. After ordering it along with a group of coworkers and trying something else I must say it has raised the bar for my Jimmy John's experience. Still not my favorite sub place but I definitely love the convenience of delivery when I don't have time to go for lunch. The bread is a little tougher than I prefer sometimes but their avocado spread is pretty tasty!
0,"We have been there many times I from 8pm to 11 pm. This is the worst I have ever seen for a restaurant ( Sonic ). SLOW, the girl at the window needed change and  the guy was busy on his iPhone  looked at her like don't bother me. Took for ever to get 2  Bergers. The owner should take a good look at who is working for him. If this is the best he can do he better look at himself SAD."
3,"A must go to for any meal. First off the decor is super trendy and my favorite color...purple! A great place for a date night. My friend and I stopped here after dinner and ordered desert crepes. I had the classic crepe with added strawberries (heaven) and she had the William tell (awesome). I can't say enough about how melt in your mouth these both were. Be aware, they are super sweet and worth sharing. However I found myself finishing off mine and then eating my friends too. The warm, tart apples were perfection paired with the caramel drizzle and my nutella was melted perfectly inside the yummy crepe and strawberries. Complimentary water and or cucumber water is served to wash it all down but next time I'll definitely try the mimosas or one of the many sodas. \nThere is a great selection of dinner crepes too that I'm dying to try!"
1,Nothing special. Probably 4 stars if you're drunk late at night. Funny how that improves just about any restaurant. If you're a tourist looking to try a classic Quebec poutine you should look elsewhere for the magical experience.
4,"Ok, so I've only been twice now but the service is amazing and better yet, the food is totally on par with my favorite Thai haunt, Komol, or wait for it....even better!  I can't wait to keep trying more things on the menu!  They have an entire separate vegetarian/vegan menu to explore.  I love this place!"
2,"Happy hour is great here at this restaurant....However you can tell they are part of a big chain working to cut costs where they can.....We tried dinner there last night....The Filet was very dry for med rare ....I have had better on my own grill purchased from a local grocery.....The shrimp cocktail is supposed to be huge shrimp as an appetizer for $17.00 and these were quite small, .the kind you would find commonly anywhere. with no flavor...The single loaf of bread was cold and the outside of it was not crispy....The butter options were good though....My other half enjoyed the salmon and it was cooked perfectly...Overall for the price of dinner, I would not go back....HOWEVER I would do happy hour there again.....The happy hour menu is good and the prices are great.... I DO WANT TO SAY THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT ARE IMPECCABLE....TRAINED WELL AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INSURE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST IT CAN BE....."
0,"Almost $10 for a \""meh\"" sandwich and tiny cup of iced tea (that came out of a jug....I saw them refill the \""tea\"" machine).  I appreciate the effort to have something healthy and organic in a mall food court, but for the price and lack of flavor I'll just go somewhere else."
3,I love this place. The food is great and SUPER healthy. They have tons of vegan and gluten free options. Its great this time of year when you can sit outside and eat.
2,"Established in 1958, Los Compadres has been offering Phoenix classic Mexican food at great prices for over 50 years.  Here you will find the Mexican food standards tacos, nachos, enchiladas, tamales, burros etc. made fresh to order.  In addition, they have egg specialties, salads, charbroiled chicken, and their something different selections...  They have 10 combos that include 2-3 items each for under $8 and lighter combos for under $5.  Los Compadres is a excellent alternative to the fast food chains claiming to serve Mexican food.  Catering services and party trays are also available.  Their hours are Monday through Saturday 10:30am to 9pm and Sundays 10:30am to 7:30pm."
1,"First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.\n\nHaving purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo."
1,"The menu displayed on urban spoon must be very old. The prizes are higher, than we researched before. Staff is friendly. The soups must be based on an instant brew. I ordered a wantang soup and it was terrible. I could taste the chemical taste of the instant brew. It was very bland.  Knowing how good a lotus stem salad usually tastes, I ordered one. Again, I felt like I wasted 10$. The sauce was terribly bland, too sweet and too sour at the same time. Also, they used way too much celery. I was very disappointed and felt like I wasted my time and money. I felt this place was WAAAY to over-prized for what they offer. And I didn't feel that it tasted authentic or refreshing like Vietnamese food usually tastes.  The menu was just the same as in Lang Van. I did see Asian people in the restaurant. So, it must be somewhat decent. The food doesn't have a \""restaurant feel\"", but more an \""American-Asian fast food feel\"".They should restructure the portions and prizing.   I will never return."
0,"This review is based on the fact that it's in Vegas.  My group wanted to go here for lunch.  They wanted a light lunch before the buffet we were planning to have later that day.  So Sonics was agreed upon (with them.)\n\nI was hesitant to go to a Sonics when we were at Vegas.  We could get this anywhere, anytime, so why now?  But I agreed, we needed a light lunch and why not have it cheap while at it.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't too cheap.  You can't just get one of their $1 burgers cuz they're tiny and you'll still be starving afterwards.  So I got the large chili cheese fries to split also.\n\nThe burgers... sucked.  Even for a dollar, they sucked.  Badly.  The chili cheese fries... WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overly salty.  Like, I was tempted to drench it in ketchup to dilute the salt.  Horrible.  Don't go to Vegas for fast food, if you do, don't go here.  There's an In N Out a few miles away..."
4,"Fabulous! I cannot say how wonderful this little place was.\n\nTucked away in the heart of downtown Phoenix, the Squash Blossom is a little sleepy cafe that serves breakfast and lunch and as of October liquor as well. In the same corridor as the Irish Pub, Squash Blossom has the most simplistic decor and it's just right. Canopies outside shade diners from the AZ sun and for me, the rare AZ rain. \nI order the Turkey BLT with sweet potato fries. My intern ordered the Backyard Bacon Blue Burger with a veggie patty replacement. They were very cooperative with replacing the patty and each our plates came with the most delicious chocolate chip cookie that was oh so very soft and moist.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and attentive. The patio had a small troff of garden veggies outside so you know this place values sustainability. My co-worker ordered the spinach salad to go and when we brought it to her she inhaled it so I think the whole menu is good to go. I cannot wait to go back!"
4,"I've never met a chile relleno I didn't like, and the one at Taqueria Canonita was especially creative and interesting.  The vegetarian entrees at most Mexican restaurants can be dull, but not here.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the chile relleno, served with roasted vegetables and jicama salad, and the wild mushroom enchiladas served with borracho beans and rice.  The chile relleno was stuffed with a mixture of dried fruit, almonds, and cheese, and the contrast between sweet and savory was a party in my mouth.  The salad was light and the orange dressing was a refreshing surprise.  The enchiladas were drenched with a velvety poblano sauce, and combined with the mushrooms, the enchiladas just slid down my throat.  The borracho beans were a smoky kidney beans with a hint of chili powder.  Oh, and don't skip the chips and fire roasted salsa; it's so good that you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Ancho Brownie, garnished with pepita ice cream.  This ancho infused brownie was ooey, gooey, and very fudgy. \n\nThe ambiance is nice for people watching, and the restaurant's location next to the canal gives the illusion that you are dining outside.  It can be a bit noisy, but all in all, I'd eat here again."
3,"Cute, quaint coffeehouse with delicious sandwiches, amazing yogurt concoctions.  Their sandwiches are stacked high and with the best cuts of meat and vegetables and what not.  They make different sandwiches and menu items daily. \n\nI happened upon this place after missing my bus stop one day, and oh boy, it's the best this side of town has to offer.  And the owner has been there every time I've stopped in and is so friendly and helpful.  It's rare to meet an owner who exceeds customer service expectations, but she does.  \n\nIf I lived on this side of town, and was independently wealthy, I'd go there every.single.day.\n\nIt's more business folks and affluent types here, so if you're looking for 20-somethings on their laptops, that's not really the type that frequents curbside.  \n\nOh, I've only had their chai lattes, so can't speak to how great the coffee is, but I will update this once I try the coffee."
2,Even though the place is almost empty there are still enough people to watch. I'm going to order the all you can eat pancakes. My wife ordered wings and a house salad. Apparently 7pm is the dinner hour for older Charlotteans. The front of the restaurant was almost full. Service was slow but there were only two servers Matt & Tiffany. Tracey was the night manager. We go there to hang out & kill a few hours so slow service doesn't matter really to us anymore. The thing I really hate is the way that the food is presented. It looks nothing like it does on the menu.
1,We ordered the Spinach Linguini (take out)... this dish was nothing but linguini and a few pieces of spinach and maybe 3 small pieces of chicken.  I'm appalled the cost ($13.95) of this dish considering it was only pasta.  The only reason this review gets two stars is because the flavor was decent.  This is our second time getting ripped off by Times Square! We were willing to give them a second try but regret it.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK!
2,"I'm trying to decide -- when it comes to pizza, am I a crust person or a topping person? If I am the latter, then I would say that the toppings we tried on three different pizzas were all good but could have been more plentiful. We especially liked the artichoke and olive pizza. Whatever exotic cheeses the chefs put on the pizzas are terrific but are just dotted on. I left the restaurant last night feeling crusty, which is to say I love the wood-fired, slightly burned, soft-on-the-inside crust. So much so that I almost finished off the crust left on my carb-watching daughter's plate. We'll see where things fall in the great crust/topping dilemma next time I visit."
4,Not a bad place to go for a little shopping. I found good deals here. Good customer service.
1,"We don't seem to exist here.  The service was horrible.  Sat at the bar right in front of the bartender who was too busy cleaning glasses to acknowledge us.  I'm usually rather patient about these types of things, as I know they have other tasks to accomplish, however, it was NOT busy at all and it wasn't like she didn't see us.  She just gave us the impression that she would get around to taking our order when she felt like it...which was certainly not any time soon.  It was awkwardly rude and strange behavior.  If I weren't new to the area (and my guest from out of town) I would have thought she was an old enemy from days gone by."
