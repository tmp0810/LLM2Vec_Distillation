4,"Came a few days ago for a lease, wasn't sure of size needed, so I guessed, three times! Finally got it right, but hey, the store didn't bat a eye lash when I returned the ones that didn't work, they just asked if I needed help picking out a replacement. \n\nSince my cat has been loosing weight, I could not get the size down, so after my attempts, finally got the small dog size and sure enough it worked. Now to get the cat used to it before we need it. \n\nThis store has everything you could need. They is even a new section by Martha Stewart, everything for you little pet. But her stuffs pricey, a lease from here collection, $19.99, boy that's steep! \n\nThe store is clean, neatly kept, well organized and they have grooming services. The employees were friendly and helpful, they looked like they enjoyed their jobs, and I would make this a regular place."
0,"I chose the 4 Queens for my visit to Las Vegas for several reasons, and I'll admit a good lot of those involved the low price of the room. (Other reasons include the proximity to the Neon Boneyard, the historic old-Vegas reputation of the hotel and the ratings on Trip Advisor.)\n\nHowever, the quality of my room was far below what I expected, or even dreamed was possible.\n\nI have very minimal requirements for hotel rooms; generally I only want them to be clean (not spotless, clean) and relatively safe. Non-smoking is also on the list.\n\nMy room at the 4 Queens was the filthiest hotel room I've ever stayed in.\n\nThere was hair (of the nether-region variety) in the bathtub. In fact, I don't think the shower or bathtub were touched by house cleaning before or during my stay. I don't like to make a fuss so wiped-everything down myself, and was too exhausted to switch rooms on top of that.\n\nEvery surface in the room felt greasy. I'm going to say it was covered in some Pledge-like substance (humor me) to make myself feel better.\n\nThere was an empty packet of Lucky Strike cigarettes behind the one side of the drapes and a lighter on the other when I arrived, and spotted quite easily. This was touted to be a non-smoking room. I left the empty cigarette pack and lighter for the duration of my stay to see of it would be eventually picked-up by the housekeeping staff. \n\nNope; no such luck.\n\nAdditionally, there were cigarette burns in the bedding (which was made of some, scratchy, ugly cheap fabric). Two of the three lamps in the room did not work. At all. The remote did not work. The air conditioner was very, very loud.\n\nI didn't realized that the Academy of Country Music awards we're being held in the city the weekend I stayed, and on the 15th floor, I could hear the awful cover bands from Fremont Street quite clearly. Granted, I should have realized the ACMs were the weekend of my stay, but the noise was a bit ridiculous.\nOh, and the folks staying in the room next door smoked weed every night of my stay. I dare say I could very well have gotten a contact-high the smell was so strong.\n\nLuckily, I take Ambien to sleep, and am dead to the world at night. Even with the Ambien, the world's rattliest, loudest air conditioner, still woke me up several times each night. This is in addition to being woken by the amazingly loud sex the reefer users next door were having. Otherwise there is absolutely no way I would have gotten any rest in this hellhole.\n\nUpdate! I initially wrote this review with one night of my stay remaining. Guess what? It got worse! The country band playing on the street on Saturday night was somehow (defying the laws of sound) louder, and played later into the evening. Once my Reefer Madness neighbors returned to their room at near 4am, they rented several porn movies and acted out scenes from them. This went on until about 8 am. I pounded on the wall twice, called the front desk, and nothing was done! I didn't sleep a wink despite the Ambien.\n\nI finally headed to the airport around 9 am, five hours early for my flight, because the hotel was just that damn bad, and I couldn't stand the filthiness and sleaze any longer.\n\nAbsolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The only thing that could have made it worse are bed bugs or a fire possibly breaking-out."
3,"I went here on the day of a wedding (I'm from out of town) for a last minute pedicure. I didn't really know where else to go, so I just stopped here on a whim (it was raining and this was the closest place that seemed to do nails). \n\nThe Salon Nuvo nail person is FANTASTIC (and wonderful to chat with). It's two full weeks later and it looks like my pedicure is brand new (and before you ask, I actually used the exact same brand/color nail polish as my prior crap pedicure). They don't have the cool massage chairs and they put you in a weird little intimate back room, HOWEVER I would totally give that up for a beautiful pedicure that lasts this long.  \n\nThought it was worth a review."
1,"Isn't it strange how the little things can sour your experience? I had a good time at Paris, the dealers were friendly, the staff was nice, the rooms were clean until I was checking out and the guy at the taxi line started yelling that my car was parked to far over. And he kept screaming and gesturing until I moved my car over until it was blocking traffic, which I was trying to avoid in the first place. I usually stay here but I won't be anymore. He was the guy on duty 2/17 at 12pm."
4,"Visit here several times a year. The food is always fresh and well stocked. They have sushi, and several seafood items for their dinner buffet. The staff is always efficient as well."
0,"I bought a voucher for this place from one of the deal sites. They accidentally crossed of my name on their list showing that my voucher was already used when it hadn't been. They then proceed to tell me that their verification method was fool proof (how can it be when nothing is scanned and everything is manually checked off by hand?) Then they tried to prove that the voucher I brought in was a photocopy reproduction (it wasn't, it was printer from a printer). All in all, a terrible experience, tried to make me out to be a thief. Why would I even go through all that trouble and reproduce a very \""real looking\"" fake voucher to save $10?!? At the end they realized their mistake. By then I had already 25 mins of my time and my order had already gotten cold. There were no apologies from the restaurant. The food was also very salty and the bubble tea was very chalky. They use powered coffeemate to cream their teas which has a huge taste difference from actual condensed or fresh milk. With all the Chinese food options in that area, I know I will never go back to this place."
4,"Like others, I'm writing a post-mortem tribute to one of my favorite restaurants in the world.\n\nMy husband and I first went to Rosemary's on our honeymoon in 2001. We've been there on every trip to LV since, and we also went to the second restaurant they had at the Rio for a while. Every  visit was a delight.\n\nMichael and Wendy, as someone who recently closed a restaurant (and is in the process of selling a second one) my heart goes out to you.  Know that you are missed, and that  I (and many many others, I'm sure) am monitoring the internet to see what you have in store for us next.\n\n~~A fan from Texas"
0,My mom and I just ate lunch there and I would never go back. We both live in the area and were excited to try it. The service was terrible. It took us forever to get our food and when it did come my pad thai was ok not great and my moms veggie torta was also mediocre. The main reason I will never go back is when we ordered desert our server verbally told us the menu and we ordered the cheesecake. When it came it was covered in peanuts after I specifically told the server I was allergic when I ordered the pad thai peanut free. I'm leaving on a flight and didn't have time for them to make me something else. So overall mediocre food and terrible service.
1,Only reason they get two stars is because their pies are great. Terrible service and don't have enough people working so it takes half an hour to get anyone to even acknowledge that you are waiting.
2,"The place has a nice atmosphere, and they've made an effort to make this basement location feel more lively, colourful and 'south americanish'. The service is really nice and friendly as well, and I'm pretty sure most of the waiters speak spanish which is a good sign when you're eating in a south american place!\nSo why only 3 stars? I love mexican/southern food so maybe I'm a slightly harsh critic, but I just wasn't really taken with the menu. \nEverything we ordered was a bit too overflowing with cheese and creme fraiche so the vibrant flavours were drowned out. The menu isn't really expensive, \u00a315 for 2 courses, but considering the fierce competition with set menus in Edina, it's probably a touch high for such simple food (plain rice, beans, chicken, flour tortillas and side salad)"
1,Very slow -- even without a lot of customers -- and very disorganized. You can't pay with the Starbucks app -- they have to take your phone and key in the number by hand!
0,Food is ok but for the love of Pete lose the  iPad check pay system! We want paper checks!!!  After having lunch with friends we were shown our individual bills on an iPad and asked to finger sign. Lunch with one entree and no drink was over $22 each with tax and tip. Really?  No detail of our bills and no paper receipts. Bad!!!
3,"I was honestly just shocked to find Gluten Free pizza`so close to home!  While I can't vouch for the reguar pizza, I would recommend the GF pizza without a doubt.  The only downside is that it takes a much longer time to prepare, but I don't think that's the fault of Fuel.  The people are always friendly and more than happy to keep us entertained while we wait for our pizza!"
0,"DO NOT GET KEYS MADE HERE!\n\nI am so annoyed with this Ace. I moved into a new place and needed to get keys made. The cashier paged someone and after waiting about 15 minutes I headed toward the exit, then he finally arrived. I had 5 keys made, 2 didn't fit.  Went back to have the 2 fixed, 1 still didn't work. Ugh!\n\nFast forward a year later and keep in mind my deteriorating memory, I once again had to get keys made and returned to this location. I got 5 made, 2 didn't work (sound familiar). When I went  back to get the keys fixed the woman who helped me told me it is not usually the fault of the people cutting the keys, but the calibration of the machine. She assured me the machine was just calibrated so we should have no issues. \n\nAnd guess what? One of the keys STILL doesn't fit."
3,"Honest, good group of people.  They don't try to sell you tires every time you come in.  They have fixed my tires twice, rotated twice and have not charged me.  Chad was very helpful and pleasant.  This is the best Discount Tire in the area.  4.5 only because they didn't tighten my hub cover the last time I was there and almost lost it."
2,"This Panera (Gosh, they popped up everywhere) is standard Panera I'd say. Smaller patio on the sidewalk and not the most inviting of patios in the small strip of a larger shopping area with Lowe's and Walmart . I usually find someone will come and smoke near you if you sit outside here for a little while (Must resist the urge to slap the person).\nUsually clean but have found the Internets here a little slower than other Panera's. \nBagel's are pretty good but get chewier as the day progresses and i don't usually make it to a Panera until the evening.  Find the food to be a little pricer for the same fare as Jason's Deli or McCalister's but always pretty fresh and good. \nLove the Chicken Noodle Soup though, my favorite!!"
2,"4 stars for being able to get a tasty and good-sized portion of spicy Malaysian Chicken Fried Rice, late afternoon without leaving Bellagio. Soaked up some of the day's excess alcohol wonderfully.\n\nA star off for having to pay Bellagio prices for the above."
4,"SHC Crossfit is Fantastic... It has changed my life, seriously, I love it.  I started crossfit at another box that was twice the cost of this box.  SHC Crossfit is not only less expensive it also has far better coaching than my 1st box!  Come check out SHC Crossfit... you won't be disappointed."
1,"I stayed at the Palazzo but accidentally checked in at the Venetian. The lady that checked me in was very rude and talk down to me. Every question I asked she acted like I was burdening her. She then gave me directions to the Venetian side and we carried our luggage all the way to the 18th floor not realizing we had to go to the 18th floor of the Palazzo. She checked me in, she should have directed metro the palazzo. The Palazzo hotel was great."
2,"Eh.  For the big Irish pub on the square, this is just average.  I like the ambiance.  It is a place to sit and have a pint while chatting with friends.  It never gets too loud.  Upstairs, the couches are fun, almost Alice in Wonderland inspired.  \n\nPrices are a bit high, but if you happen to luck out for happy hour then you are golden.  They have happy hour everyday from 10pm to close.  It is a nice place to end your day and get a deal. \n\nI have had their food a couple of time.  It is ok.  I am just not overly excited about this place.  They always card. ALWAYS.  Kind of annoying because I am obviously over 21 and there creates this HUGE congestion at the door.  \n\nI do not hate this place but I do not love it."
0,"For a place that just opens pre-made packages and plops them on a salad-bar, I would think that this effort might not have been to challenging. Perhaps I had my hopes up too high.\n\nI went here for a quick bite as I had business in the neighborhood. I must say, I would have done better anywhere else. The salad selection was less than fresh to say the least. A person kept barging out of the back to refill things, and was super surley. Just get in her way and get an elbow.\n\nAfter the salad selection are random canned things. I guess those were ok. I am not sure.\n\nThey also have a \""hot bar\"". This is where things get really depressing. They had a kind-of taco set-up thing going with what appeared to be ground beef. Except it wasn't! It was straight-up textured vegetable protein! Who even does that? I got a baked sweet potato, and that thing had been sitting under a heat lamp for what seemed weeks and was inedible. The soups were just blah. Who serves french onion soup without the topping? The pizzas they had on the platter were less than what you would expect from the cheapest of frozen pizzas.\n\nJust all in all horrible. I left having drank and unsweetened ice tea and left a plate from the all-you-can-eat salad bar totally full.\n\nWhat a waste of time and money. This place is gross."
1,"I would give this place 2.5 stars.\nThere was nothing really terrible about kofusion but there wasn't anything that great about it either!\nAtmosphere- fine. A little sparkly for my taste but whatever. It was busy, otherwise sitting outside on the patio would have been much nicer.\nService- I know it was busy but the service was a mess. The food came out really fast but none of us had chopsticks, or soy sauce, or ginger, or wasabi, and they were about to just leave us! Not to mention trying to get a drink!\nFood- pretty bland and mushy with a couple good standouts on my sampler plate. I swear, one of the bad ones must have been the bologna of the sea because it looked/tasted like a hunk of spam stuffed into a roll form topped with some sauce. I spit that one out. \nThere were a couple good pieces that after I try every other sushi restaurant in C-U I might come back for."
0,"I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.\n\nIn my phoenix and dragon I had five \""jumbo\"" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \""spicy chicken\"" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \""spicy\"" sauce that wasn't very good.\n\nI also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.\n\nI suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, \""Oh, you just called. It's almost there,\"" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot. So there's that.\n\ntl;dr small portions, not jumbo shrimp, not spicy, not very good, long wait, unfriendly staff on the phones, friendly drivers, and they litter my apartment building a lot."
3,Really good Chinese food.  The duck and pork noodle soup is awesome.  Portions are not that generous so be advised but worth it for Chinese hotel strip food.
4,"777.... that's it, you don't wanna try anything else, best steak ever. Never disappoints you..my favorite late night dinning place"
0,"Wow. This was a waste of time. It seemed that they wanted to teach about a couple of habitats and be a zoo but they didn't have enough funds to realize the objective. There are a few animals and some displays about habitats, but we found this to be really disappointing."
2,"Meh... It was just ok. The food looked better than it tasted :-/  I had the BBQ chicken, greens, and mac & cheese. I would give it another try, but order other items from the menu. \n\nAside from that, the service and atmosphere were great!"
0,"Complete, utter, crap. Ignored by servers for hours after we sat down and it was not busy there.\n\nHad to ask for everything. Forks? Yup we didn't get those. Water? Had to constantly ask for refills by flagging down any passing staff.\n\nYou may think the food is really good only if you haven't actually traveled outside of the fast food box.\n\nI thought it was mediocre at best, but combine that with the horrible staff and the only experience you will have here is boredom."
2,"I want to start off by saying I usually hate fish and chips but agreed to try this place out with my friend as per our usual yelp event. I instantly loved it. the restaurant itself is very casual laid back feel, we ate outside however. The service was good as well. \n\nI ordered the salmon fish and chips in  a Guinness batter and my friend ordered the cod. We swapped one each so we can try both. I personally enjoyed the salmon more but they were both delicious. We also both split the popcorn shrimp which were great. \n\nA great fish and chips joint with quality ingredients thumbs up!"
0,"Worst service I have ever recieved. I go to this Starbucks a lot because it's on my way to work and everytime I regret it. The service is slow, even when I'm the only person in the drive thru. It take them forever to even greet me, and the coffee isn't that great either"
